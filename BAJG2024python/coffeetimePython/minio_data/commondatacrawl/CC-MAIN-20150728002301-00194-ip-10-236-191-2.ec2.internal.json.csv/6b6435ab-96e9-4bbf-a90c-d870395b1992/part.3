The Auction 1000 Request for Comment includes specific proposals, including on determination of the initial broadcast television spectrum clearing target, opening bid prices, benchmarks for the final stage rule, and the final television channel assignment process, and seeks comment on those proposed procedures., 248481=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 156330=The Audio Division, at the request of JER Licenses, LLC, substitute alternative Channel 281C for vacant Channel 280C at Toquerville, Utah to accommodate the √¢¬Ä¬úhybrid√¢¬Ä? application that requests the downgrade of the new FM station from Channel 281C3 to Channel 280A at Peach Springs, Arizona. A staff engineering analysis confirms that Channel 281C can be allotted to Toquerville, Utah consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Rules without a site restriction. The reference coordinates for Channel 281C at Toquerville are 37-15-12 NL and 113-17-00 WL. See Supplementary Info. supra., 180108=The Incentive Auction Task Force provides the results of several staff simulations of the initial clearing target optimization procedure proposed in the Auction 1000 Comment PN and/or Comment PN as discussed further in this under the Supplementary Information. In this document, the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) Incentive Auction Task Force seeks comment on the data and analyses released in this document and the attached Appendix., 238269=In this document, the Commission proposes to expand to cable operators, satellite TV providers, broadcast radio licensees, and satellite radio licensees the requirement that public inspection files be posted to the FCC's online database. In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 263883=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, √Ç¬ß 73.202(b) of the Commission's rules, by allotting Channel 277A at Shelter Island, New York, as a first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 277A can be allotted to Shelter Island consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules with a site restriction located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of the community. The reference coordinates are 40-57-54 NL and 72-22-59 WL., 288576=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by WLAJ-TV LLC, the licensee of station WLAJ-TV, channel 51, Lansing, Michigan, requesting the substitution of channel 25 for channel 51 at Lansing. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. WLAJ-TV LLC has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 25 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 159332=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 27816=At the request of Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, the Audio Division amends the FM Table of Allotments, by allotting Channel 233A at Sagaponack, New York, as the community's first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 233A can be allotted to Sagaponack consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) northwest of the community. The reference coordinates are 40-56-01 NL and 72-18-55 WL., 323474=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KCEB License Company, LLC (√¢¬Ä¬úKCEB License√¢¬Ä?), the licensee of KCEB(TV), channel 51, Longview, Texas, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Longview. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees.

Mas a humanidade sempre ""criou"" seus pr√É¬≥prios seres, geralmente extraordin√É¬°rios. Os gregos eram particularmente imaginativos, e a mitologia cl√É¬°ssica √É¬© cheia de monstros como a Quimera, o c√É¬£o C√É¬©rbero, o Minotauro, a Medusa e um sem-n√É¬∫mero de outros h√É¬≠bridos. Como se ver√É¬° mais adiante, a palavra quimera foi tomada de empr√É¬©stimo na mitologia para designar as constru√É¬ß√É¬µes artificiais de mol√É¬©culas (em geral DNA). Inicialmente a imagina√É¬ß√É¬£o do homem atribu√É¬≠a a algum deus a gera√É¬ß√É¬£o dos seres monstruosos ou, ao contr√É¬°rio, extraordinariamente belos. A id√É¬©ia de que estes seres podiam ser fabricados por um ser humano s√É¬≥ veio muito depois, mas em v√É¬°rias partes do mundo os homens criaram ""protocolos""√Ç¬† para a gera√É¬ß√É¬£o de vida a partir de material ""morto"", desde simples insetos at√É¬© o pr√É¬≥prio ser humano.

Ela foi apresentada pela primeira vez ao p√É¬∫blico numa confer√É¬™ncia em 1985 e foi pronta e amplamente aceita pela comunidade cient√É¬≠fica. A popularidade da t√É¬©cnica, assim como seu conceito, ganhou crescente popularidade ao longo dos anos seguintes., 137403=Em muitos casos de muta√É¬ß√É¬µes pontuais a t√É¬©cnica de PCR/RFLP n√É¬£o pode ser aplicada, seja porque n√É¬£o h√É¬° s√É¬≠tio de restri√É¬ß√É¬£o conhecido para o entorno da muta√É¬ß√É¬£o, seja porque m√É¬∫ltiplas muta√É¬ß√É¬µes s√É¬£o poss√É¬≠veis no gene de interesse, tornando a abordagem acima impratic√É¬°vel. Uma alternativa √É¬© o mis-match PCR, ou PCR com pareamento err√É¬¥neo. O princ√É¬≠pio desta t√É¬©cnica, descrito pela primeira vez por Cotton et al., em 1988, e tamb√É¬©m conhecido com CMC - chemical mismatch cleavage - baseia-se na clivagem de DNA em locais com pareamento err√É¬¥neo pela piperidina, e est√É¬° representada na figura abaixo. Um indiv√É¬≠duo heterozigoto tem uma muta√É¬ß√É¬£o pontual numa regi√É¬£o qualquer do gene. Podemos amplificar esta regi√É¬£o com primers dirigidos a suas extremidades, como fizemos na PCR/RFLP. Em seguida aquecemos o produto do PCR e deixamos esfriar rapidamente para induzir a forma√É¬ß√É¬£o de heteroduplexes (uma fita simples de um alelo e a complementar do outro) al√É¬©m dos homoduplexes (as dus fitas pareadas de volta, de um mesmo alelo). Nas regi√É¬£o n√É¬£o pareadas ou com pareamento err√É¬¥neo com bases C e T liga-se o produto hidroxilamina ou o tetr√É¬≥xido de √É¬≥smio, respectivamente. Uma vez ligados, estes produtos permitem a clivagem do DNA neste local pela piperidina. Assim, 50% dos produtos de PCR ser√É¬£o cortados por este sistema em todo lugar onde houver uma muta√É¬ß√É¬£o. Em geral os fragmentos gerados pro este sistema s√É¬£o pequenos e devem ser visualizados em gel de poliacrilamida. A figura abaixo mostra como funciona este sistema., 145902=A medi√É¬ß√É¬£o da radia√É¬ß√É¬£o √É¬© feita pelo aparelho, que ta√É¬ßa um gr√É¬°fico com a absor√É¬ß√É¬£o obtida ap√É¬≥s cada ciclo de PCR. O ciclo em que o patamar (limite) de negatividade √É¬© ultrapassado est√É¬° diretamente relacionado √É¬† quantidade de DNA molde na mistura. Com isto, a quantifica√É¬ß√É¬£o de DNA molde passou a ser n√É¬£o apenas poss√É¬≠vel, mais r√É¬°pida. O sistema ainda √É¬© bastante dispendioso mas tender√É¬° a se tornar mais barato √É¬† medida em que novos sistemas entrarem no mercado e um maior n√É¬∫mero de m√É¬°quinas for dispon√É¬≠vel., 48386=√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† E como se ver livre do ""lixo"" representado pelas bact√É¬©rias que t√É¬™m o plasm√É¬≠deo vazio? N√É¬£o √É¬© poss√É¬≠vel, pois o plasm√É¬≠deo vazio confere a mesma resist√É¬™ncia ao antibi√É¬≥tico que o plasm√É¬≠deo carregado. Entretanto, √É¬© poss√É¬≠vel averiguar ao menos se, no conjunto de plasm√É¬≠deos formados, a maior parte est√É¬° carregada (com inserto) ou, ao contr√É¬°rio, vazia. Para tal os plasm√É¬≠deos de clonagem t√É¬™m uma segunda marca de resist√É¬™ncia a antibi√É¬≥ticos (em geral, tetraclina), que √É¬© perdida quando o plasm√É¬≠deo √É¬© aberto e o inserto √É¬© clonado. Significa dizer que o s√É¬≠tio de clonagem √É¬© interno ao gene para a resist√É¬™ncia √É¬† tetraciclina. Significa tamb√É¬©m dizer que as bact√É¬©rias que t√É¬™m plasm√É¬≠deos vazios s√É¬£o resistentes a ampicilina e tetraciclina, enquanto as que t√É¬™m plasm√É¬≠deos com inserto s√É¬≥ mostram resist√É¬™ncia a ampicilina. O procedimento baseia-se na obten√É¬ß√É¬£o de uma r√É¬©plica de uma placa de Petri contendo col√É¬¥nias crescidas em presen√É¬ßa de ampicilina, que √É¬© ent√É¬£o carimbada sobre uma nova placa de Petri contendo tetraciclina. As col√É¬¥nias que crescerem tamb√É¬©m em tetracilcina n√É¬£o interessam, mas podem ser contadas. A figura abaixo mostra esquematicamente o procedimento, desenvolvido para outros fins, h√É¬° quase 50 anos, por Joshua Lederberg, que tamb√É¬©m recebeu o Pr√É¬™mio Nobel pelos seus estudos (Joshua Lederberg, George Beadle e Edward Tatum receberam o pr√É¬™mio Nobel de Fisiologia ou Medicina em 1958.

Mullis nasceu em 1944 em Lenoir, Carolina do Norte, EUA. Obteve o grau de bacharel em qu√É¬≠mica em 1966 no Instituto de Tecnologia da ge√É¬≥rgia e o PhD em Bioqu√É¬≠mica pela Universidade da Calif√É¬≥rnia em Berkeley. Passou ent√É¬£o 7 anos como p√É¬≥s-doutor em Cardiologia Pediatria e Qu√É¬≠mica Farmac√É¬™utica na Escola de Medicina da Universidade de Kansas (EUA). Em seguida reebu um convite para trabalhar como t√É¬©cncio na Cetur Corporation, em Emeryville, em 1978. Foi l√É¬° que teve a id√É¬©ia da PCR., 100104=Em 1983, Kary Mullis, ent√É¬£o pesquisador empregado na Cetus Corporation, EUA, imaginou uma forma de fazer com que a DNA polimerase iniciasse e terminasse seu trabalho em trechos pr√É¬©-determinados do DNA. Com o sistema seria poss√É¬≠vel amplificar milh√É¬µes de vezes um pequeno trecho de um longo segmento de DNA. A id√É¬©ia foi aprimorada na Cetus e apresentada pela primeira vez em 1985, numa confer√É¬™ncia. Depois disso a t√É¬©cnica, conhecida como PCR, ganhou quase instantaneamente uma aceita√É¬ß√É¬£o mundial e em menos de uma d√É¬©cada tornou-se o procedimento b√É¬°sico de todo laborat√É¬≥rio de gen√É¬©tica molecular no mundo., 113145=Quando PCRs s√É¬£o realizadas, gerando produtos de diferentes comprimentos, e estes produtos s√É¬£o analisados por transilumina√É¬ß√É¬£o UV em gel de agarose, o resultado que se obt√É¬©m pode ser semelhante ao mostrado abaixo. O menor dos produtos migra mais r√É¬°pido e gera a banda mais em baixo no gel. Em geral o gel de agarose separa bem fragmentos entre 150 pb e 1000 pb. Fora desta faixa pode ser necess√É¬°rio usar um gel de poliacrilamida., 150184=Devido ao alcance e popularidade da PCR Kary Mullis foi apontado e recebeu o pr√É¬™mio Nobel de Qu√É¬≠mica em 1995. Esta indica√É¬ß√É¬£o foi duramente contestada por muitos que acreditavam que a PCR foi apenas um desenvolvimento de t√É¬©cnica e que sua concep√É¬ß√É¬£o n√É¬£o era suficiente para dar a Mullis o status de nobelista. Mullis argumentou a seu favor que a uni√É¬£o das t√É¬©cnicas pr√É¬©-existentes no formato por ele criado fazia toda a diferen√É¬ßa., 101634=A id√É¬©ia de Mullis era simples. Adicionava-se ao tubo de ensaio um pouco de DNA contendo o trecho que queria amplificar, os dNTPs, a DNA pol e dois primers de DNA feitos em laborat√É¬≥rio, um hibridizando numa fita e ""apontando"" para o outro, que hibridizava com a outra fita e ""apontava"" para o primeiro. A dist√É¬¢ncia entre os s√É¬≠tios de pareamento dos dois primers n√É¬£o podia ser muito grande, e foram escolhidos para testes trechos com menos de 1000 pb. Com todos os reagentes no tubo, a rea√É¬ß√É¬£o era inicialmente aquecida a 94 oC, para que todas as fitas de DNA se desnaturassem. Em seguida a temperatura era reduzida para permitir o pareamento dos primers, em geral para 50 oC. Por fim, a temperatura era reduzida ainda mais, at√É¬© 37 oC, para que a DNA polimerase de E. coli pudesse trabalhar e estender duas fitas simples de DNA, uma a partir de cada primer, duplicando, assim, a sequ√É¬™ncia alvo escolhida. Ao se repetir o ciclo os primers encontrariam agora dois alvos cada um, a partir do primeiro alvo replicado: um no DNA original e outro na c√É¬≥pia rec√É¬©m sintetizada, gerando, por sua vez, ao fim do novo ciclo, 4 c√É¬≥pias do alvo. √É¬â claro que a repeti√É¬ß√É¬£o do processo geraria um n√É¬∫mero de c√É¬≥pias do alvo que se elevaria exponencialmente, com base 2., 149575=Em 1989 a revista Science escolheu a mol√É¬©cula usada na PCR, a Taq polimerase, como a primeira√Ç¬† ""Mol√É¬©cula do Ano""., 31786=√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† As esperan√É¬ßas ressurgiram na d√É¬©cada de 70, atrav√É¬©s de uma s√É¬©rie de trabalhos balizadores de Hamilton Smith, um bi√É¬≥logo molecular que trabalhava na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Ele purificou a primeira enzima s√É¬≠tio-espec√É¬≠fica, a enzima Hind II, da bact√É¬©ria Haemophilus influenzae. Esta descoberta crucial foi obra do acaso (com tantas outras): incubando bact√É¬©rias e fagos juntos, Smith observou que o DNA do fago degradava aos poucos. Ele e seus colaboradores conseguiram purificar a enzima respons√É¬°vel pela degrada√É¬ß√É¬£o e posteriormente identificaram a sequ√É¬™ncia de seis pares de bases que ela reconhece e cliva, sempre na mesma posi√É¬ß√É¬£o, sempre da mesma forma! Logo muitas outras enzimas foram descobertas e agora h√É¬° mais de 3000 j√É¬° descritas. Cada enzima cliva o DNA num s√É¬≠tio espec√É¬≠fico e com estas enzimas foi poss√É¬≠vel manipular o DNA como nunca antes. Um dos trabalhos mais festejados, que vieram na cola das descobertas de Arber e Smith, foi o de Daniel Nathans com SV40, que pela primeira vez empregou estas enzimas para mapear fisicamente o DNA. Seus experimento levaram em 1972 √É¬† primeira tentativa bem sucedida de clonagem de DNA, conseguida por Paul Berg., 117610=Seria ideal que pud√É¬©ssemos disponibilizar em Downloads um relato de Mullis sobre o PCR a partir da sua apresenta√É¬ß√É¬£o na Academia Nobel. Entretanto, n√É¬£o h√É¬° na p√É¬°gina da Academia Sueca que coordena o Nobel (http://www.nobel.se) as palestras de Kary Mullis e Michael Smith.

Quando se d√É¬° a clonagem, o gene lacZ fica interrompido. A primeira parte do gene servir√É¬° para codificar os primeiros amino√É¬°cidos da prote√É¬≠na recombinante (representados pela cabe√É¬ßa de cavalo ao final do esquema). A segunda metade nunca ser√É¬° expressa porque os ribossomos terminar√É¬£o a s√É¬≠ntese num c√É¬≥don de termina√É¬ß√É¬£o muito anterior ao in√É¬≠cio do trecho restante do lacZ. No caso espec√É¬≠fico do exemplo da figura, o inserto cont√É¬©m parte da ORF (presumivelmente no mesmo quadro de leitura do lacZ, 1a. parte) e portanto h√É¬° no fim desta ORF um c√É¬≥don de termina√É¬ß√É¬£o do gene do organismo doador. Se o quadro de leitura estiver errado ou se apenas a extremidade 3√Ç¬¥ UTR for clonada, existe uma pequena chance de que os ribossomos alcancem a 2a. parte do lacZ, mas provavelmente fora do quadro de leitura (2 chances em 3). De uma forma geral, podemos afirmar que a segunda parte do lacZ nunca √É¬© traduzida., 149784=Em 1991 a PCR se tornou extremamente comum em laborat√É¬≥rios pelo mundo afora e refer√É¬™ncias ao uso da t√É¬©cnica j√É¬° somavam milhares nas revistas cient√É¬≠ficas.
