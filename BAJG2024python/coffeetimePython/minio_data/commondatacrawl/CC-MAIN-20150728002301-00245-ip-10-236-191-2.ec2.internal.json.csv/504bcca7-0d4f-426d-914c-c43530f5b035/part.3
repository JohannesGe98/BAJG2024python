You can go out at 8pm or 3am and you'll feel completely safe. Not only is the campus safe but the surrounding is also. There's always someone walking around so you'll never feel scared from being alone but even if you are alone, the quiet is very peaceful."", ""The Greek life here is amazing. If you're someone that loves to party but you're always about your academics, giving back to the community and making friends, Greek Life is for you. It's not only about partying, the Greek organizations are heavily involved in community service. It's great."", ""The vast clubs and activities opportunities is one of the best things about West Georgia. Whether you like to dance, draw, plan activities or even want to be a doctor, this school has something for you! For example, there's an organization called Emerging Healthcare Leaders that helps students interested in studying medicine receive volunteer clinical hours, and you receive mentoring. There are many organizations and clubs here, and you can also start a club!"", 'Students that are interested in nursing will love West GA. They have one of the best nursing programs in the Southeast. Also, students that are very outgoing or looking to participate in more activities on campus will have many things to choose from.', ""There's this funny tradition, well it's more like a myth that's been passed down where if you touch the white structure that sits in the middle of campus while you're still a student here, you won't graduate. It's really silly but funny to see the faces of freshman when they're told"", ""College isn't cheap and neither is West GA, but it is affordable. The perks that come with paying tuition and fees is great. It's worth it."", ""Besides partying with the Greek organizations, there is a campus game room that has a ping pong table, air hockey table, pool tables and game systems (Xbox, PS3 and Wii) that are completely free. If you're a competitive person, the game room is for you. There are clubs and organizations that throw on campus parties and carnivals in the Love Valley, which is awesome because they have food and rides!"", ""The food is very diverse and the quality is nice. You're not stuck eating Ramen Noodles every night because West GA has awesome meal plans. There is everything from different fruit to Shrimp Po Boys. There are also restaurants surrounding the campus that take dining dollars (which comes with a meal plan) which is awesome when you just want to walk off campus and get food. The school is very big on encouraging students to eat healthy and serving us healthy food. There is also Chick Fil A, Subway, Starbucks, Burger Studio and Sushi Bowl on campus."", 'Dorm life here is amazing. You can come and go as you want. The rooms are different sizes, depending on what Residence Hall you live in but they are all manageable. In some dorms, the students will have a bathroom to share with one roommate and a kitchenette or a room to share with a roommate and communal bathrooms. There are two laundry rooms in a building and study rooms on every floor, which is very helpful. There are also vending machines and elevators', ""The teachers at this school are very helpful when it comes to academics. It is a lot of work and it gets challenging but if it isn't a challenge, it isn't worth it. There is torturing for all core classes for freshman and it is completely free. At the tutoring center, they are really helpful in the way that you walk out knowing you will pass the test rather than them doing the work for you."", ""Visit the campus at least twice before making a decision to stay here because you have to go to a school that is perfect for you, no matter how good a school is, if you don't feel comfortable there then it isn't the school for you.Apply to as many scholarships as possible. Also, when you start school pace yourself. Don't throw yourself into a lot of different activities in the first few weeks of school because you'll burn out. Study! Read the material before you go to class and after you get out of class. Take advantage of the free tutoring, you'll need it. Don't be afraid to ask questions and most important, talk to someone if you're feeling uncomfortable in any way. The counseling department here is very helpful."", 'West GA is in a small little college town that is that has an amazing community feel.

Their is a bus system to take you to class or all classes are in walking distance if necessary.', 'This is the second university I have attended and comparing the two, west Ga is more challenging. The academic rigor depends on the course you are taking.', 'In my opinion, the best tip to receive in school is, get involved. College does not have to be all about keeping your nose in the books. There are many opportunities to pass your free time with fun activities. You could join a sport, club, work on your fitness, be part of Greek life, and much more. In my experience college is more enjoyable and you will get the chance to meet people like you to help push you in the right direction. Everyone there is there for the same reason, to get a degree.', 'The University of West Georgia is a great place to attend college.

The Oaks and Bowden are the best locations to live because it's near the meal hall, the library and the academic quad. We are improving on certain areas on campus, we have defense classes and only had a few incidents this year of robbery."", ""Our Greek Life plays a big role here on campus. Personally, I would recommend waiting until your sophomore year, or at least rush Spring during your freshman year. I am so glad I waited to rush because I got to find out more about the sororities here on campus over the past two semesters; things you can't learn in a few days. Our Greek Life is the biggest social network this campus has to offer. It's either rush or be a GDI, Gosh Darn* Independent. I had this idea of what Greek life was prior coming to college, but West Ga Greek Life definitely changed that out look. Can't wait to rush fall. Go wolves!"", 'Greek Life is the biggest.

The Pub and Plates is where most people go to drink. Greek Village is a blessing and a curse because all the houses are put together, but not everyone gets along.', 'Apply for scholarships. I was shocked when I heard that none of my friends got a refund. Basically you have a bill-breakdown and then you have your financial aid. Whatever you have left over is put on a debit card for you to use anywhere, not just on campus.', ""Pre-game, drink, frat parties, and events. That's about the regular here. We do have relay for life, and Greek Life hosts events dealing with their philanthropy. Also we have a good bit of concerts here. We've had Florida Georgia Line and Tyler Farr in the fall then Third Eye Blind, and Panic at the Disco this spring."", ""Waste of money. Unless its taco salad, or fried chicken, I hate eating at our East Commons and Z6. Everything else on campus, chick-fil-a, starbucks, sushi express, that burger place, are all delicious, but each meal averages at about $8 a meal. Now, as a freshman, you have to get a meal plan here. Sorry, but your parents need to know that you are being fed, even if the food is not edible. Sophomore year, you'll move off campus and never have to go there again. It's kind of like right of passage, in a way."", ""The only thing I hate about our dorm life is everybody who is around me. Quiet hours are a joke to be quiet frank. If it's 2 AM and some people above you are being loud, you have a better chance of getting anywhere when you go up there instead of sending an RA, who usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to finally get there. If you are OCD, get a single room. If you don't know anybody prior to coming to college, get a single room. My roommate is messy and I've just gotten to the point that anything on my desk, chair or bed that is not mine is thrown away. Oh, and if you are a slob, please do us all a favor and get your own room. You may be okay living in your own filth, but I'm sure your roommate won't be as enthused. And go co-ed. Even if you have a boyfriend back home, be in a co-ed dorm. Best decision I ever made"", 'Even though we were one on the top ten list for most drug and alcohol arrests (oops) we still take pride in our academic life. The library is open from Sunday at 2 until Friday at 8pm. We have on campus tutoring, a writing center to assist with essays, and some of the dorms even off tutoring in their lobby. The professors also are pretty good here about their office hours. I heard from other colleges that office hours were a joke and with the exception of two professors, I have always been to office hours for clarification or assistance.', ""Don't rush Greek Life right away, unless you are a legacy and know which house you want to rush. I waited and glad I did, but plan to rush fall of my sophomore year. It's super easy to make friends here. There are different aspects of student life you can get involved with. Student Government, something pertaining to your major, Greek life, and even sports. Don't get the unlimited food plan. Even if you don't go West. You'll want to avoid the freshman 15 (or more like 50 here) as much as possible. Don't pick up bad habits. You'll start and then in a few months realize how stupid it was to do it."", 'At this point, we are all pretty much alcoholics, but we do take school seriously. 24/5 library hours and on campus tutoring are the most used campus resource.

Sometimes, depending on the time you go to the dining hall, there is not always a great variety of food there. The UCC is a great option for dining as well since it has Burger Studio, Chick-Fil-A, Subway, a sushi restaurant, and a pizza restaurant. Only one of the dining halls is 24 hours though, and if you do not have an all access meal plan, you cannot go to this dining hall after 10 p.m. without having to pay. A great on-the-go way to grab a small meal is to do a meal exchange at the POD on campus; however you can only do this between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Dining dollars can be used at the POD, dining halls, the UCC, Einstein's Bagels, and Starbucks. The amount of dining dollars you get depends on which meal plan you sign up for, but you can always add more, just keep in mind that you will have to pay back the amount that you add onto your account."", 'The dorms are pretty nice. I stay in Center Pointe Suites and the dorms have their own bathrooms so the halls are coed. There is enough space for the things that I legitimately need (after being moved in for a few weeks I found out what items I actually needed instead of the items I convinced myself that I needed). The RAs are nice and will answer questions if you have any about your room, and maintenance will come by very quickly if there is a problem in your room. For example, I had a problem with the heat in my room and filed a request at about midnight and they came by at about 10 the next morning. If you are locked out of your room, however, you have to pay a $10 fee for ReStar to let you into your room (unless a nice RA lets you in for free).', 'The professors are very helpful and will work with you if you need help.

Get to know your professors well, it can help you out in the long run. 3.) Spend less time with friends and more time with homework and studies. 4.) UWG offers many great tutoring programs, so when you need help feel free to visit the tutoring centers. Don't wait till the last minute or week of class to as for help. 5.)

Always stay focused on your primary goal ahead of you and always keep God first in everything you do."", 'The University of West Georgia is must go school for those who are looking for something new and special.

We have a day of glow in the dark golfing! Like to step, dance, sing, or act? We have it all here! You really get your money's worth at the University of West Georgia. Am enjoying being here I love being at West Georgia. It's a great school for me because it's not too far from home, but it's far enough for me to feel independent. They have so much to do here. They have plenty of clubs and activities so that you can get out and socialize and make new friends. They have a lot of things for freshman to do when they come here also. They have bonfires, step shows, talent show, poetry nights, Greek Strolls, haunted houses (only for Halloween), and so much more. Am learning a lot",True,0,0,,

In addition, precise descriptions allow the driver to judge when or where a situation will occur and thus aid in response preparation. Design Guidelines COMPOSITION OF TEXT LABELS Introduction: The content of text labels can affect the comprehension and interpretation of an icon's text label. Words should be chosen carefully to increase clarity and take into account the vocabulary level of potential users. Tufte, E. R. (1983). The visual display of quantitative information.

International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 25(1), 39-50.","Discussion: Research indicates that warning text explicitness and severity has an effect on the perceived level of hazard of product warning labels (references 1, 2, 3, and 4). For example, reference 2 examined the explicitness of warning labels on infant car seats. Subjects rated their perceived hazard, likelihood and severity of possible injury, and the intent to act cautiously. Results indicate that explicit warning labels increase the perception of possible hazards and injuries as well as ratings of cautious intent. Reference 5 evaluated the comprehension of product warning labels, specifically the difference between ""flammable"" and ""combustible."" The study found that very few respondents knew the difference between the two terms, and most perceived the incorrect term as more hazardous. Similarly, terms used to describe driving situations may be misunderstood or ignored by drivers who do not comprehend the vocabulary used. Design Issues: When selecting icon text wording, using more explicit labels describing severe consequences can increase warning compliance. However, to be effective, these descriptions must consider the users' vocabulary level. A compromise between terminology simplicity and precision must be made to increase comprehension. For example, an icon alerting the driver to a malfunction of the vehicle's alternator can be described in a number of ways. A message such as ""Engine Problem"" may not be adequately explicit, while ""Alternator Failure"" may be overly precise and not understood by users who are not familiar with engine terminology. A compromise such as ""Charging System Failure"" may be sufficient.

Small spots of intense saturated color can convey information effectively. This requires a conservative use of these colors and the use of less saturated colors for backgrounds (reference 1). Color, such as red, can be used to enhance the relative salience of icons. Therefore, color choices should be made with respect to the relationship between messages (relative urgency of messages) and the relationship between messages and the background upon which they are presented. Arbitrary codes using color to convey meaning are likely to induce errors. For temperature, use red for hot and blue for cold. Use red to indicate highly urgent messages, yellow to indicate cautionary information, and green to indicate normal operations or safe conditions. Use color coding only when well-established conventions exist, such as temperature, dangerous situations, and permissiveness. Design Guidelines ENHANCING ICON INTERPRETATION WITH COLOR Introduction: Enhancing icon interpretation with color refers to how color can highlight information and enhance drivers' interpretation of icons; however, color can also confuse and mislead drivers if used incorrectly. Tufte, E. R. (1983). The visual display of quantitative information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press. Zhang, J. J., and Norman, D. A. (1995). A representational analysis of numeration systems.","Figure 5.5 Schematic Examples of the Use of Color in Icons Discussion: The most common and consistent use of color for conveying information in the driving context is in traffic control devices. The use of green as permissive, amber or yellow for warning, and red for restrictive is almost universal. Red also has a powerful ability to convey urgency and hazard when used in warnings. Another important instance where color has come to hold a strong meaning is in the use of red for hot and blue for cold. These are two examples of ""population stereotypes"" or generally held expectations. When designing with color it is important to understand population stereotypes and conform to these expectations. Colors should not be used to convey meaning when there is not a well-established stereotype. Drivers will confuse the meaning of arbitrary color codes. Beyond conveying specific meaning, color can also effectively highlight information and enhance interpretation of complex icons (references 1 and 2). Effective use of color in this role requires careful design that considers the use of color in relation to its context. Using color to highlight specific features or to enhance the salience of an icon requires a relatively muted and conservative use of color elsewhere.
