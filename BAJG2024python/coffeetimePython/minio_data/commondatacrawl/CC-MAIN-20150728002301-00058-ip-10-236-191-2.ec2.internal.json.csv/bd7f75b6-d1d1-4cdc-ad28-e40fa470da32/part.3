There are no general education requirements. The only required course for all majors is a writing class, which is offered in many subject areas to allow you to explore a subject different to your major, or enhance your interest in your current major. Students are required to complete a cluster (or minor if you are ambitious) in subject areas outside of your major. Between humanities, social sciences and natural/applied sciences, students major in at least one, and complete a cluster (3 connected classes) or minor in each of the other. You are allowed and encouraged to diversification in an area of your interest, whether or not it is directly applicable to your future career or not. The idea is to have you learn as much as you can about any and all areas of interest. We have a huge number of majors and minors, and you can create your own as well.

Instead of wasting time on General Education Requirements UR gives students the freedom to find what really interests them and what they want to do with their lives. The University of Rochester uses a cluster system instead of General Education Requirements. Basically, every student has to take a cluster of at least three classes in three different general disciplines: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. However, the cluster system is very flexible and can fit in with students' interests, for the most part. In addition, there are other schools at the University besides the College of arts and sciences including, school of nursing, school of medicine and dentistry, school of engineering, and Eastman School of Music. This is nice because it allows UR students to take free voice lessons at Eastman. UR really offers classes for every interest in every subject area.

If you're musical, the Eastman School of Music, rated second in the country, is part of the U of R! You can take classes there for free, and get some of the best musical instruction in the world! Also, for the pre-meds, the Medical School is just a 5 min walk off campus and the people there love to teach people-even undergrads!

Instead of wasting time on General Education Requirements UR gives students the freedom to find what really interests them and what they want to do with their lives. The University of Rochester uses a cluster system instead of General Education Requirements. Basically, every student has to take a cluster of at least three classes in three different general disciplines: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. However, the cluster system is very flexible and can fit in with students' interests, for the most part. In addition, there are other schools at the University besides the College of arts and sciences including, school of nursing, school of medicine and dentistry, school of engineering, and Eastman School of Music.

It also contains the Eastman school of Music, which is one of the best music schools in the nation. However, the Rochester curriculum can really be tailored to fit any type of student.

Instead of wasting time on General Education Requirements UR gives students the freedom to find what really interests them and what they want to do with their lives. The University of Rochester uses a cluster system instead of General Education Requirements. Basically, every student has to take a cluster of at least three classes in three different general disciplines: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. However, the cluster system is very flexible and can fit in with students' interests, for the most part. In addition, there are other schools at the University besides the College of arts and sciences including, school of nursing, school of medicine and dentistry, school of engineering, and Eastman School of Music. This is nice because it allows UR students to take free voice lessons at Eastman. UR really offers classes for every interest in every subject area.

There are no general education requirements.

Students are required to complete a cluster (or minor if you are ambitious) in subject areas outside of your major.

You are allowed and encouraged to diversification in an area of your interest, whether or not it is directly applicable to your future career or not. The idea is to have you learn as much as you can about any and all areas of interest. We have a huge number of majors and minors, and you can create your own as well.

Instead of wasting time on General Education Requirements UR gives students the freedom to find what really interests them and what they want to do with their lives. The University of Rochester uses a cluster system instead of General Education Requirements. Basically, every student has to take a cluster of at least three classes in three different general disciplines: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. However, the cluster system is very flexible and can fit in with students' interests, for the most part. In addition, there are other schools at the University besides the College of arts and sciences including, school of nursing, school of medicine and dentistry, school of engineering, and Eastman School of Music. This is nice because it allows UR students to take free voice lessons at Eastman. UR really offers classes for every interest in every subject area.

Students are required to complete a cluster (or minor if you are ambitious) in subject areas outside of your major. Between humanities, social sciences and natural/applied sciences, students major in at least one, and complete a cluster (3 connected classes) or minor in each of the other.

It also contains the Eastman school of Music, which is one of the best music schools in the nation. However, the Rochester curriculum can really be tailored to fit any type of student. The only necessary quality I would say is dedication. Tips for prospective students The University of Rochester loves to see an International Baccaulaureate degree or Advanced Placement credits. And of course, as with any other college, make sure to have plenty of extra-curricular activities and community service.

Vegan and vegetarian options are found everywhere and the school is very accommodating towards documented allergies. The food is edible, but don't expect high quality, 328703=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 49160=Dandelion Day is typically the last Friday in April, when the entire student body congregates on the residence quad for a carnival, celebrating the arrival of good weather, and the end of a looonnnnngggg winter., 184147=It snows from December to April. There is an underground tunnel system linking different academic buildings that you come to appreciate during the winters., 295417=If you have time to spare, then I recommend going to Danforth Dinning with is located in the Freshman building Sue Bee, Susan B. Anthony. If your in a rush, go to Douglass, or the pit, which is the basement of Common Connections. If you ever have time, which you will, I strongly recommend getting a Mel Burger which is in the Meliora Dinning Center above Douglass Dinning Center. It was annoying as a freshman that you were required to get an unlimited dinning plan because it was expensive and had little declining. However, this upcoming year 2013-2014 should offer a new plan for freshman which offers so many meals a semester and more declining. I would recommend getting one of those plans rather than the unlimited since you get to choose what you want., 211329=Engineering--the school is one of the top for engineering--and anyone who wants to do research. It's in the top 40 in research universities. There is a med school, so students who want to be medical professionals are also perfect. The Sign Language program is amazing, taught by deaf teachers. Rochester has a 1:7 deaf to hearing ratio., 103354=Hey! The University was ranked sixth (6th) by the Daily Meal in their 75 Best Colleges for Food in America for 2014., 105285=The University of Rochester is one of the nation's leading higher education. With a faculty to student ratio of 9:1, students are assured that they will receive the attention necessary for them to succeed throughout their years here at the U of R. Class size are typically 10-25 students, but in the sciences and math, it tend to be pretty large. But wait, don't be scared, workshops or professor/teacher assistant office hours are offered for to students sitting in these classes. In writing classes, there are also writing fellows and consultants at your service. If interested, I would advice a prospective student to do intensive research about the university.

More specifically, UR has an amazing medical program, since it is associated with Strong Memorial Hospital. It also contains the Eastman school of Music, which is one of the best music schools in the nation. However, the Rochester curriculum can really be tailored to fit any type of student. The only necessary quality I would say is dedication. Tips for prospective students The University of Rochester loves to see an International Baccaulaureate degree or Advanced Placement credits. And of course, as with any other college, make sure to have plenty of extra-curricular activities and community service. Bang for the buck Though it is very expensive, the University of Rochester is very prestigious, a degree from UR means more than from other colleges. In addition, the Career Center will work with you throughout and after your college career to help you find the best job and start earning back some green. Am enjoying being here The students and the faculty are great. There is always someone to help you at the University of Rochester with academics. Plus there are literally hundreds of clubs that you can join. These",True,0,0,

Do not submit information that you consider to be CBI or otherwise protected through http://www.regulations.gov or e-mail. The http://www.regulations.gov Web site is an Ã¢Â€Âœanonymous accessÃ¢Â€? system, which means EPA will not know your identity or contact information unless you provide it in the body of your comment. If you send an e-mail comment directly to EPA without going through http://www.regulations.gov your e-mail address will be automatically captured and included as part of the comment that is placed in the public docket and made available on the Internet. If you submit an electronic comment, EPA recommends that you include your name and other contact information in the body of your comment and with any disk or CD-ROM you submit. If EPA cannot read your comment due to technical difficulties and cannot contact you for clarification, EPA may not be able to consider your comment.

On December 21, 2007, EPA addressed the Court's remand, and took final action to establish that a Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable possibilityÃ¢Â€? applies where source emissions equal or exceed 50 percent of the Clean Air Act (CAA) NSR significance levels for any pollutant (72 FR 72607).

Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. Parties with objections to this direct final rule are encouraged to file a comment in response to the parallel notice of proposed rulemaking for this action published in the proposed rules section of today's Federal Register, rather than file an immediate petition for judicial review of this direct final rule, so that EPA can withdraw this direct final rule and address the comment in the proposed rulemaking.

EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the Federal Register. A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This action is not a Ã¢Â€Âœmajor ruleÃ¢Â€? as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2)., 83195=On June 13, 2007 (72 FR 32526), EPA took final action to revise the 2002 NSR Reform Rules to remove from Federal law all provisions pertaining to clean units and the PCP exemption that were vacated by the DC Circuit Court. In the final partial approval of the NSR Reform rules into the Indiana SIP (72 FR 33395), EPA did not take action on the clean unit and PCP portions of the rules at IDEM's request. Although today's action is proposing to approve Indiana's removal of these provisions, EPA never approved them into the SIP. Indiana has removed the following rules due to references to clean units and PCPs: 326 IAC 2-2-1(m), (dd)(2)(H), (ii)(6)(D), and (ll); 326 IAC 2-2-2 (d)(5) and (f); 2-2-4(a)(3); 2-2-5(b); 2-3-1(j), (y)(2)(H), (cc)(3)(B)(iii), and (cc)(3)(B)(iv)(EE),(gg); 326 IAC 2-3-2(c)(5) and (l); and 326 IAC 2-3-3(b)(12). Additionally, IDEM has removed references to clean units and PCPs in 326 IAC 2-2-4(a) and (b); 2-2-7(a); 2-2-8(b); and 2-2-10; 2-3-2(m), but the remainder of those subsections remain intact., 52525=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 87152=We are publishing this action without prior proposal because we view this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipate no adverse comments. However, in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register publication, we are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal to approve the state plan if relevant adverse written comments are filed. This rule will be effective September 6, 2011 without further notice unless we receive relevant adverse written comments by August 8, 2011. If we receive such comments, we will withdraw this action before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed action. EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. Please note that if EPA receives adverse comment on an amendment, paragraph, or section of this rule and if that provision may be severed from the remainder of the rule, EPA may adopt as final those provisions of the rule that are not the subject of an adverse comment. If we do not receive any comments, this action will be effective September 6, 2011., 86870=EPA is approving the revisions to the PSD rules at 326-IAC 2-2-1, 326 IAC 2-2-2, 326 IAC 2-2-4, 326 IAC 2-2-5, 326 IAC 2-2-7, 326 IAC 2-2-8 and 326 IAC 2-2-10, and Emission Offset rules at 326 IAC 2-3-1, 326 IAC 2-3-2, and 326 IAC 2-3-3., 71548=EPA is approving Indiana's modifications to its Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) rules. The amendments include grammatical changes, corrections to numbering, addition of definitions consistent with Federal PSD and NNSR regulations, and removal of references to provisions which were vacated in the Federal rules. Indiana submitted these rule revisions to EPA for approval on November 24, 2010. They are consistent with the current Federal PSD and NNSR regulations., 85256=The November 7, 2003, reconsideration rule added the definition for Ã¢Â€Âœreplacement unitÃ¢Â€? at 40 CFR 52.21 (b)(33), which means an emissions unit for which all the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(33)(i) through (iv) of this section are met. No creditable emission reductions shall be generated from shutting down the existing emissions unit that is replaced. The definition has been added to Indiana's regulations at 326 IAC 2-2-1(tt) and 326 IAC 2-3-1(nn)., 77903=Docket: All documents in the docket are listed in the http://www.regulations.gov index. Although listed in the index, some information is not publicly available, e.g., CBI or other information whose disclosure is restricted by statute. Certain other material, such as copyrighted material, will be publicly available only in hard copy. Publicly available docket materials are available either electronically in http://www.regulations.gov or in hard copy at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

We recommend that you telephone Charmagne Ackerman, Environmental Engineer, at (312) 886-0448 before visiting the Region 5 office., 92462=In addition, this rule does not have Tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), because the SIP is not approved to apply in Indian country located in the state, and EPA notes that it will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law., 81834=On December 31, 2002, EPA published final rule changes to the PSD and NSR programs (67 FR 80186) (2002 NSR Reform Rules), and on November 7, 2003, EPA published a notice of final action on the reconsideration of the December 31, 2002 final rule changes (68 FR 63021). After the 2002 NSR Reform Rules were finalized and effective (March 3, 2003), various petitioners challenged numerous aspects, along with portions of EPA's 1980 PSD and NNSR Rules (45 FR 5276, August 7, 1980). On June 24, 2005, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit Court issued a decision on the challenges to the 2002 NSR Reform Rules. See New York v. United States, 413 F.3d 3 (DC Cir. 2005). In summary, the DC Circuit Court vacated portions of the 2002 NSR Reform Rules pertaining to Ã¢Â€Âœclean unitsÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœpollution control projectsÃ¢Â€? (PCPs), remanded a portion of the Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable possibilityÃ¢Â€? provisions (40 CFR 52.21(r)(6) and 40 CFR 51.166(r)(6)), and either upheld or did not comment on the other provisions included as part of the 2002 NSR Reform Rules., 74013=This direct final rule will be effective September 6, 2011, unless EPA receives adverse comments by August 8, 2011. If adverse comments are received, EPA will publish a timely withdrawal of the direct final rule in the Federal Register informing the public that the rule will not take effect., 80630=We are approving amendments to Indiana's PSD and Emission Offset regulations. Previously, EPA approved revisions to these regulations into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on June 18, 2007 (72 FR 33395). On November 24, 2010, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) requested that EPA approve PSD and Emission Offset rule amendments to the SIP. The rule amendments include grammatical changes, corrections to numbering notation, the addition of definitions consistent with Federal PSD and NNSR regulations, and removal of references to provisions which were vacated in the New Source Review (NSR) Reform Rules. These amendments are contained in Indiana's PSD rules at 326 IAC 2-2-1, 326 IAC 2-2-2, 326 IAC 2-2-4, 326 IAC 2-2-5, 326 IAC 2-2-7, 326 IAC 2-2-8 and 326 IAC 2-2-10, and Emission Offset rules at 326 IAC 2-3-1, 326 IAC 2-3-2, and 326 IAC 2-3-3., 75120=3.

Please register for each session through ITL. Tech Talk Tuesday is a series of information sessions hosted by Instructional Services, the University Libraries, and the Institute for Teaching and Learning. The sessions are designed as a quick way to learn more about a technology or topic. You'll learn what it is, why you'd use it, how to get started, how to learn more and, how to receive training. These are not ""deep dives"", though each session will be staffed by knowledgable UA personnel who can answer any in-depth questions you may have. You can find handouts and recordings of most of the previous sessions below along with the current schedule.

"[['PROFITABILITY RATIOS:', 'Net Sales to Gross Sales NET SALES TO GROSS SALESNET SALES TO GROSS SALES shows the percent of all transactions that may be considered as ""good"" net transactions. Differences may arise from returns, bad product, or other sales concessions.', 'Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size. Formula: Total Overhead Cash Expense / Net Revenues', 'Operating Profit to Sales OPERATING PROFIT TO SALESOPERATING PROFIT TO SALES is a useful ratio when evaluating value of a firm. It discounts the effect of varying tax rates and benefits to give a more accurate indication of the return associated with the firm. Operating Profit (EBITDA) / Net Revenues.', 'Basic Earning Power BASIC EARNINGS POWERBASIC EARNINGS POWER (BEP) is useful for comparing firms in different tax situations and with different degrees of financial leverage. This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management. Formula: EBIT / Total Assets', 'Return on Assets (After-tax) RETURN ON ASSETS RETURN ON ASSETS (ROA) shows the after tax earnings of assets. Return on assets is an indicator of how profitable a company is. Use this ratio annually to compare a business performance to the industry norms: The higher the ratio the greater the return on assets. However this has to be balanced against such factors as risk, sustainability and reinvestment in the business through development costs. Higher ROA is better, but extremely high ROA may be an indicator of vulnerability as to any sustainable competitive advantage. Formula: Earnings After Tax (EAITDA) / Total Assets', 'Return on Equity RETURN ON EQUITYRETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) measures the overall efficiency of the firm in managing its total investments in assets and in generating a return to stockholders. It is the primary measure of how well management is running the company. ROE allows you to quickly gauge whether a company is a value creator or a cash consumer. By relating the earnings generated to the shareholders equity, you can see how much cash is created from the existing assets.

This ratio measures the length of time it takes to convert your average sales into cash. This measurement defines the relationship between accounts receivable and cash flow. A longer average collection period requires a higher investment in accounts receivable. A higher investment in accounts receivable means less cash is available to cover cash outflows, such as paying bills.

It is imperative to compare a companys inventory turns to the industry average. A company turning their inventory much slower than the industry average might be an indication that there is excessive old inventory on hand which would tie up their cash. The faster the inventory turns, the more efficiently the company manages their assets. However, if the company is in financial trouble, on the verge of bankruptcy, a sudden increase in inventory turns might indicate they are not able to get product from their suppliers, i.e., they are not carrying the correct level of inventory and may not have the product on hand to make their sales. If looking at a quarterly statement, there probably are more or less turns than an annual statement due to seasonality, i.e., their inventory levels will be higher just before the busy season than just after the busy season. This does not mean they are managing their inventory any differently; the ratio is just skewed because of seasonality.

However, realize that this ratio can be unfavorable if either too high or too low. A company must balance the cost of carrying inventory with its unit and acquisition costs.

In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved.Ã‚Â Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue Sample Sample Sample Sample Sample Sample Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements. The rule of thumb Current Ratio for small companies is 2:1, indicating the need for a level of safety in the ability to cover unforeseen cash needs from current assets. Current Ratio is best compared to the industry. Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities', 'Quick Ratio QUICK RATIOQUICK RATIO (or Acid Test Ratio) is a more rigorous test than the Current Ratio of short-run solvency, the current ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%. Shareholders benefit from gearing to the extent that return on the borrowed money exceeds the interest cost so that the market values of their shares rise.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages.
