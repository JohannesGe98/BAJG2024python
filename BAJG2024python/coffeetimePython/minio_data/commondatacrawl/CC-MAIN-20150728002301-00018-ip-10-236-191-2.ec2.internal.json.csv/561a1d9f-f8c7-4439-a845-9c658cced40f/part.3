The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances. When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about communicating more with my professors, study groups, and tutoring services if needed.

Tips for prospective students TIME MANAGEMENT!!! It's so important to make sure you dedicate enough time to your studies especially in your first year. Also, probably the most important tip I can offer an incoming freshmen would be to get involved. The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education. Luckily, FSU works with the budget crisis committee and so far has not cut anything vital to the education system or the student activities at FSU. A student here can get a great education and have fun for one of the lowest rates in the state. Am enjoying being here Being at Florida State was by far the best choice I could have made for myself. There are so many activities for students that are virtually free, a student can find",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus.

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances.

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor.

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family.

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances. When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about communicating more with my professors, study groups, and tutoring services if needed. Also looking back I realized how nice I had it at home such as free food/rent, money to buy clothes, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to pay for classes nor books. Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year.

The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year.

The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

You'll never be bored here."", 'There are many options when it comes to food and dining at Florida State.

Also dorm life is a very good way to meet new people and make new friends. It is something every freshman should look into because it is beneficial."", ""Classes are hard without a doubt but college is meant to challenge your skills and help you grow as a person. It is much different than high school but don't let it discourage you. There will be a few bumps in the road but you can handle it the school wouldn't accept a student if they didn't think they could handle it."", ""Come to the school with an open-mind do not limit yourself, college is made for students to grow and learn from new experiences. Try new things you never know what you may like. Stay focused though don't let the fun distract you from your studies, because your studies are the main reason you're here."", 'Florida Sate is an amazing school in every way possible in my eyes. The faculty is extremely helpful and the students and faculty are all so nice and welcoming. The classes make you use your full potential and work hard.

The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will.

You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division.

Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes.

In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.

Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about communicating more with my professors, study groups, and tutoring services if needed. Also looking back I realized how nice I had it at home such as free food/rent, money to buy clothes, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to pay for classes nor books. Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about managing my own finances and developing a budget each semester. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve opened up a checking account to simplify the tracking of my college expenses. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing how my account can look so big in the beginning of the semester and shrink so quickly by the end of it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like what everyone says itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about balancing what is important. Bang for the buck FSU has a bus service that runs from 7am to 7pm and itÃ¢Â€Â™s free to students as part of your tuition. The student football tickets are also a great value in my opinion.

The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education. Luckily, FSU works with the budget crisis committee and so far has not cut anything vital to the education system or the student activities at FSU. A student",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will.

However, they do have a number of parking garages. You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division. There are old and new dormitories for students that are filled with mostly freshman. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best to get your application early if you want to get into the new ones. It also has one of the best Greek systems in the nation and IÃ¢Â€Â™m happy to be a part of it. If you want a school where you can learn, play, and save money then FSU is the school for you. The biggest enjoyment for me is when everyone on campus and the surrounding city unite to form the strong school spirit that Seminoles are known for.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest.

Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine.

This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more.

Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about managing my own finances and developing a budget each semester. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve opened up a checking account to simplify the tracking of my college expenses. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing how my account can look so big in the beginning of the semester and shrink so quickly by the end of it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like what everyone says itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about balancing what is important. Bang for the buck FSU has a bus service that runs from 7am to 7pm and itÃ¢Â€Â™s free to students as part of your tuition. The student football tickets are also a great value in my opinion. FSU also offers many scholarships and grants to those students who meet the eligibility requirements.

YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus.

There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort.

The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances. When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about communicating more with my professors, study groups, and tutoring services if needed. Also looking back I realized how nice I had it at home such as free food/rent, money to buy clothes, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to pay for classes nor books. Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest.

In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division.

There are impressive red brick buildings, water fountains, bronze sculptures, and winding tree-lined walkways. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s easy to get around campus, although parking can be sometimes difficult. However, they do have a number of parking garages. You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division. There are old and new dormitories for students that are filled with mostly freshman. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best to get your application early if you want to get into the new ones. It also has one of the best Greek systems in the nation and IÃ¢Â€Â™m happy to be a part of it. If you want a school where you can learn, play, and save money then FSU is the school for you. The biggest enjoyment for me is when everyone on campus and the surrounding city unite to form the strong school spirit that Seminoles are known for. IÃ¢Â€Â™m amazed at the enthusiasm from the crowd during the pre-game ritual when a student dressed up like Chief Osceola throws down the flaming spear in the middle of the football field thereby",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor.

There is always a distress beacon withing site, which immediately calls FSU's on campus Police Department, to your destination. Police Officers are always patrolling, and offer text based warnings of dangerous times, areas, or weather alerts, to keep you informed."", ""Being a part of Greek Life, I can safely say it was one of the greatest decisions of my life. All fraternities hold GPA's higher then the All Men Average at FSU. All fraternities engage in philanthropic services, raising over 3 million dollars last year for all types of Philanthropies. The men and women of Greek life hold many positions on the School Student Government, and they are extremely involved on campus."", ""Intellectual- FSU's Psychology school offers hundreds of oppurtunites for research. Their Biological Sciences, and Nursing Schools are some of the most renowned insitutions in the U.S. Business Oriented- FSU's Business School is top par amongst other public institutions. Fun Seeking- FSU has hundreds of clubs ready to be joined, tons of fraternities and Sororities seeking your pledge to them. The Night Life in Tallahassee offers many clubs, bars, restaurants, parks to enjoy."", ""There are several traditions FSU's Students hold dear to their hearts. For instance, when it is a Students Birthday, it is tradition to throw him in Westcott Fountain, singing happy birthday as he/she tries to get out. There are hundreds of chants, songs, and cheers Seminoles sing at games, at parties, or with friedns, that are as contagious as laughing. Once you start chanting, you will find that half the room will be chanting with you, and the other half getting ready to join in. Since Florida State has been around for quite a long time., there are countless tradition and song, that if you become a student, will learn and enjoy, long past your graduation."", 'FSU definitely offers more bang for your buck, that is if you look for things to do. You can just as easily keep to yourself and your studies. Its all what you are into, and what you pursue.', ""Florida State definitely has a wide variety of things to do for fun. FSU offers hundreds of clubs to join. If you cant find one you want to join, you can create one. If clubs aren't your avenue of choice, FSU offers competitive Inter-murals of a wide range of sports, in which you create, coach, and name a team, in order to compete against your fellow student body. If you plan on going Greek, FSU has over 30 national Fraternities, and even more in Sororities. Over 35% of the Student Body goes greek."", ""The Dining Experience of FSU is better than most Universities. The dining experience can be summed up into two regions. The Dining Halls, which resemble more of a cafeteria, and the Paid franchises on campus, such as Chilis, Einsteins, and Subway. The cafeterias: Suwannee and Fresh Foods offer an eclectic choice of foods everyday, with several different options. Each cafeteria has vegetarian options, and different courses in case one meal isn't doing it for you. Each Cafeteria caters to a healthy lifestyle offering premium yogurt, a fully stacked salad bar, and countless other choices of drinks besides Soda. Buying a meal plan is definitely the way to go if you live on campus, as it removes the stress of buying, cooking, and storing food in the limited capacity of a dorm. Dining Halls have full Wi-Fi services and an all you can eat bar, if you feel like cramming all day for that big test coming up."", 'Dorm Life was an incredible experience. While the living quarters are small, and there leaves the possibility of having one or more difficult roomates or suitemates, the experience is incredible. Living in dorms lets you be part of the School. Every inch of the campus is within walking distance, almost every incoming freshmen lives in dorms, and it is extremely easy to meet people. FSU provides activities several times a month to help Students meet other members of their dorms and opportunities to socialize. If you are planning to live in a dorm for your first or more years of college I would highly recommend it. It was an invaluable experience for me as it helped me assimilate into the college lifestyle and meet almost every friendship I have today.', 'Classes are Challenging. The teachers are interested in spending their time lecturing as efficiently as possible, so you will have to study quite frequently outside of class. If you study, attend class, and ask questions, you will succeed.', 'Being a Junior at Florida State University I have come to realize several tips to ensure success. Some are as easy as attending classes and studying at least 2 hours outside of class per credit hour. This is to ensure an A in each of your courses. I would also advise you, to take advantage of the hundreds of Extra- Curricular Activities FSU offers. College only comes once; being involved in activities outside of classes offers easy and long lasting friendships, a support system for the times when college will be to much to handle (trust me this will happen), and an active, challenging, and interesting hobby.', 'Florida Stat University is one of the greatest decisions of my life. The Campus is beautiful, the Teachers are both extremely capable and interested in your education, and the Campus Lifestyle is as extensive as you want it to be. Surrounded by an environment of competitive and intellectual peers, Florida State University makes it quite easy to succeed, and provides hundreds of opportunities to get involved in both on and off campus activities.']]",Florida State University (FSU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Florida-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/102250,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,197,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00018-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,894343791,894134984,HORIZONTAL,"06/10/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about managing my own finances and developing a budget each semester. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve opened up a checking account to simplify the tracking of my college expenses.

There are so many to choose from! Not sure where to look, well no worries! At the beginning of the year, there's always a big club fair in the union, where clubs will set up tables and answer any questions you have about joining in the fun.

You have not lived until you've taken a birthday swim in the fountain."", ""There's SO much to do at FSU and in Tallahassee! On campus we have a bowling alley, paint a pot, Club Downunder (where there's always free concerts for students with new and upcoming artists and comedians), The SLC (a computer lounge, coffee bar, open mic nights, and ALWAYS free movies that are recently on the screen), The Leach (gym with swimming pool, indoor track, exercise classes, plenty of equipment etc), Intermural Sports, Market Wednesday, Concerts and performances by the school of music or musical theater, various guest speakers at Moore Auditorium, Football games, Basketball games, monthly events by the Student Activity Board, and more. And that's only ON campus. Off campus there's even more that you can do. Malls, movie theaters, clubs everywhere, many art festivals and downtown events. There are a few special restaurants that students like to go to like Mr. Robotos, Sumo Sabi, Momo's, the Sweet Shop, and more. There's never a dull moment in Tallahassee."", ""The food at FSU is really good as well. They have 3 dining halls to choose from, plus a food court and other restaurants located around campus. The Suwannee room is very large and full of choices (Grill, Comfort Food, Deli, Salad Bar, Pizza, Pasta, etc). All the dining rooms put their menus online so you can see what's for dinner every night. I personally really enjoyed Fresh Food because they had such a variety of foods to choose from, all of them delicious, and they even had an ice cream bar. It might be a bit of a walk, but if you can get over there, it's definitely worth it. I have not been to the third dining hall yet, but I do hear that it is very good as well. They also have a Chili's, Pollo Tropical, Freshens (smoothies and crepes), Papa John's, Sushi Bar, Subway, Salad Creations, Denny's All Nighter, Einstein's Bagels (my personal favorite) and two separate Starbucks locations. You will never grow bored of the dining options on campus."", ""Dorm life wherever you go is not as easy as living at home. You will have to share your room with a roommate, it will be a smaller area, and you'll have to learn to part with your privacy. However, the dorms at FSU are actually very nice. The RA's are always there to help you in any way they can. Every month the individual dorms will throw events to bring all the people together and encourage people to socialize. You can live in a 'Living Learning Community' which is a dorm specified to certain interests you have (Social Justice, Wellness, Science, Music, etc) and allows you to meet people that share your interests and helps you make new friends. The dorms around Landis Green (Cawthon, Jennie Murphree, Landis, and Gilchrist) are newly renovated and extremely nice. They are also in the center of campus, so everything is very close by. I thoroughly enjoyed living in the dorms."", ""Of course, it all depends on what major you are pursuing and what classes you take, but all in all I'd say that the academic rigor of FSU is at a moderately high rate. We may not work ourselves to death with courses, but we still take our academics very seriously. Stroz (our library) is always packed with students studying hard for their next test. We pride ourselves in academic excellence, having some of the top programs in the country. If you come here, you can be guaranteed that you will be getting the best education possible in your major."", ""Don't be afraid to go out and explore the campus. There are so many things for you to do, not only on campus, but also in Tallahassee itself! There are plenty of clubs and organizations out there that you can join. If you have an interest, you can bet there's a club you can join that has to do with it. Go see a performance on campus! We have one of the top music and musical theater schools in the country, and there's always a performance going on! Get out there and meet new people. College is a time for exploring and growing as people, and meeting others is just another way to make your experience on campus more enjoyable."", ""FSU is a thriving college, filled with activity and life, and new things to do every day.

Tips for prospective students TIME MANAGEMENT!!! It's so important to make sure you dedicate enough time to your studies especially in your first year. Also, probably the most important tip I can offer an incoming freshmen would be to get involved. The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education. Luckily, FSU works with the budget crisis committee and so far has not cut anything vital to the education system or the student activities at FSU. A student here can get a great education and have fun for one of the lowest rates in the state. Am enjoying being here Being at Florida State was by far the best choice I could have made for myself.

I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit.

Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete.

In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

Tips for prospective students TIME MANAGEMENT!!! It's so important to make sure you dedicate enough time to your studies especially in your first year. Also, probably the most important tip I can offer an incoming freshmen would be to get involved. The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization.

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit.

YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division.

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances.

Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit.

Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort.

The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will.

YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry.

A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind.

I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest.

Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

The cleaning staff is great."", ""I can honestly say I have been challenged every semester I've been at FSU, and that is exactly what I need. This doesn't mean the classes aren't enjoyable though.

As an off-campus freshman I found it very difficult to keep up with what was going on around campus, so I missed out on a lot. Also it is more difficult to meet people and stay in the social loop. Not to mention it keeps you focused on your schoolwork."", ""A great school on the whole. I am challenged and know I am receiving a quality education. It is expensive, but what State College isn't?

The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education.

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

Dorms have a resident assistant per floor. The apartments are two to four residents with one or two shared baths, small kitchen and living space. The dorms have social activities that commence early then taper off as students become involved in their lives.', 'It depends on the major field of study. Science classes are typically more rigorous because of the components including labs and lectures. Many required classes have large lectures, with small labs. Elective classes offered are diversified and require major reading and writing papers. Many undergraduate classes have weekly review sessions built into the class schedule. Elective classes tend to be smaller allowing for more interaction and discussion.', 'Compare your long term educational goals before you apply, by comparing major interest areas classes. Visit each campus and if possible stay overnight during the week when classes are in session. Try to attend a class or two when you visit each campus. Try out the food courts on campus. Check out the student center for an idea of campus activities. Walk the campus and experience what it takes to get across campus in fifteen to twenty minutes for classes.

YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on.

A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort.

To ensure safety, FSU has instituted a Blue Light Trail consisting of over 400 strategically placed light poles equipped with emergency speaker phones and topped with strobe lights to assist anyone in the event of an on-campus emergency."", ""If there's one thing you cannot escape at Florida State, it's the ubiquitous ability to have fun. Nearly fifteen nightclubs surround the campus, some even within a two minute walking distance of dormitories, and most are clueless when it comes to reading IDs properly. Not your cup of alcohol? Florida State also features several student-run entertainment opportunities, such as a bowling alley located within the Student Union, and Student Life Center featuring a full-sized movie theater with nightly showings. Wildlife can be enjoyed at the Rez - FSU's own off-campus reservation inclusive of boating, volleyball, and drunken tanning days. And if none of these catch your eye, the 500+ Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) at FSU will surely have something that matches your desires."", ""All-you-can-eat student dining centers and multitudes of on-campus resturants are available to appease your colossal college diet - best yet, all on-campus eateries accept FSU Cash which can be reloaded by your parents or affable uncle. The world's only double-sided Starbucks restaurant can be found in Strozier Library - however, it's really nowhere near as cool as it sounds. Can't fill yourself enough on campus? Tens upon hundreds of fast-food joints within a one-mile radius of campus are sure to make you regret leaving Mom and her home cooking."", ""Florida State dormitories are said to be modeled off of the Florida State lottery system. You're not guaranteed to be spoiled and you will loose substaintal money at the offset. Your dormitory assignment is technically based off of your dormitory application date, but guarantees as to which dormitory you will be assigned are not made. You may end up in top-notch residences such as Wildwood and Degraff, or be stuck in the second class, and quite possibly mold-infested, Smith and Kellum residences. Either way, your abhorrent application fee will be gladly accepted by the University Housing Office. Luck, and some praying, is all you have here."", ""If you're like any other remiss college student, the first two years of college will be the worst years academically. Business, accounting, any music, and engineering majors will be hit the hardest with near-certain failing in one or more prerequisite courses. Once you're over the two-year hump and you've acclimated to an appropriate study style, your remaining years will be a breeze. Most professors are willing to help - even those teaching classes holding to the upwards of 300 students - and the ACE Learning Studio is available at no-charge most hours of the day for additional help."", ""Fear not the overflowing introductory class sizes and crammed dormitories, Florida State students are certainly some of the friendliest individuals you'll ever come across. Nightlife can be found everywhere in Tallahassee - some say there's too much - so be prepared to party off any newcomer stress. But, be sure to remember that you're here for academics before it's too late and you've the only two course withdrawals you'll get as an undergraduate student. Midterms and finals will certainly be tough, but nowhere near as tough as finding a seat to study in any of FSU's libraries - cram in your dormitory! Most importantly - avoid at all costs using a vehicle for campus transportation - finding a parking spot will be as rare as having your tuition decrease in coming years!"", ""A remarkable university embracing decades of enthralling history, astounding campus scenery, and wide ranges of activities to keep bookworms to party animals content. Boasting state-renowned Greek Life organizations, nationally-recognized collegiate sports teams, and an endowment in excess of $500 million, Florida State University's acclaimed excellence is bar-none.

There are impressive red brick buildings, water fountains, bronze sculptures, and winding tree-lined walkways. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s easy to get around campus, although parking can be sometimes difficult. However, they do have a number of parking garages. You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division. There are old and new dormitories for students that are filled with mostly freshman. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best to get your application early if you want to get into the new ones. It also has one of the best Greek systems in the nation and IÃ¢Â€Â™m happy to be a part of it. If you want a school where you can learn, play, and save money then FSU is the school for you. The biggest enjoyment for me is when everyone on campus and the surrounding city unite to form the strong school spirit that Seminoles are known for.

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances. When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college.

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about communicating more with my professors, study groups, and tutoring services if needed. Also looking back I realized how nice I had it at home such as free food/rent, money to buy clothes, and I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to pay for classes nor books. Again, those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college. Now itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about managing my own finances and developing a budget each semester. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve opened up a checking account to simplify the tracking of my college expenses. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing how my account can look so big in the beginning of the semester and shrink so quickly by the end of it. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s like what everyone says itÃ¢Â€Â™s all about balancing what is important. Bang for the buck FSU has a bus service that runs from 7am to 7pm and itÃ¢Â€Â™s free to students as part of your tuition. The student football tickets are also a great value in my opinion. FSU also offers many scholarships and grants to those students who meet the eligibility requirements. There are also a number",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

Club Downunder is our own music club and there are tons of great concerts, I've seen Matt & Kim, Mates of State, and many comedians have performed as well. The Student Life Cinema plays recent movies and cult favorites, and also has video game nights. There are also many opportunities to participate in open mic nights, or you can just go watch. Also there are large scale events in the Ruby Diamond Auditorium each semester. I've seen Nick Offerman, Elie Wiesel, Spike Lee and many other people give great presentations.

Some are living learning communities, where you can live with students who are in the same major as you. The two most popular ones are social justice living learning and the students in the music program that live in Cawthon Hall.', 'The classes are challenging, but not too difficult.

If you do decide to have a car, make sure you know the hours for each lot and garage. Certain lots are only open in the evening to students and only a few of the garages are overnight.

I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe.

Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s largest magnetic of itÃ¢Â€Â™s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

Freshmen usually have meal plans and can go to Fresh Foods on one side of campus or Suwanne on the other. Both offer an array of prepared meals, pizza, sandwiches, salad bars, and dessert.

It's not neccesary to live in one, but I would definitely reccommend it! They are conveniently close to classes and allow for you to get a feel of the campus your first year there.

There are impressive red brick buildings, water fountains, bronze sculptures, and winding tree-lined walkways. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s easy to get around campus, although parking can be sometimes difficult. However, they do have a number of parking garages. You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division. There are old and new dormitories for students that are filled with mostly freshman. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best to get your application early if you want to get into the new ones. It also has one of the best Greek systems in the nation and IÃ¢Â€Â™m happy to be a part of it. If you want a school where you can learn, play, and save money then FSU is the school for you. The biggest enjoyment for me is when everyone on campus and the surrounding city unite to form the strong school spirit that Seminoles are known for. IÃ¢Â€Â™m amazed at the enthusiasm from the crowd during the pre-game ritual when a student dressed up like Chief Osceola throws down the flaming spear in the middle of the football field thereby",True,0,0,"{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year.

These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family.

These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest.

Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry.

In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it.

The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business.

In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor.

Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year.

There are impressive red brick buildings, water fountains, bronze sculptures, and winding tree-lined walkways. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s easy to get around campus, although parking can be sometimes difficult. However, they do have a number of parking garages. You can always find the lawns and pathways filled with students enjoying the walk to class, throwing a frisbee, studying under a tree, or soaking up the sun. There are student lecture halls that are 200-300+ which somewhat common during the first year or two, but I hear that they will disappear by the time you reach the upper division. There are old and new dormitories for students that are filled with mostly freshman. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s best to get your application early if you want to get into the new ones.

The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. YouÃ¢Â€Â™ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. ThereÃ¢Â€Â™s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you donÃ¢Â€Â™t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide.

It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSUÃ¢Â€Â™s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus.

The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",,

I think that any student who believes in the traditions that Florida State University represents would be proud to attend this university. I believe that any student can relate to the Florida State University's motto, which is Vires, Artes, and Mores. These are Latin words that signify strength, skill and character. These words have formed the very foundation that has been driving force behind my continued success at Florida State University. Any student that embodies these same traditions and is passionate about pursing excellent education will be an excellent addition to the Seminole family. Tips for prospective students My words of advice to prospective students would be to develop better study habits and management of my finances. When I was in high school I could study the night before a test and do very well on it. Those days are definitively over now that IÃ¢Â€Â™m in college.

If you have any questions at all pertaining to your financial aid awards, where to go on campus, or even if you need to find out your student ID number your college admissions counselor will take the time to return your phone call and make sure you understand every step perfectly. Also, if you do not yet know your major take advantage of the wonderful Academic Advising department. This school is dedicated to prospective students as well as continuing students.

Tom,who is in charge of security, is really interactive with students. On the first day of orientation he will tell students to put the number for security in their phone. He cares about safety of students and holds seminars and presentations to educate the students. One thing that is unusual for security at a school to do is offer rides to the bus station and to certain areas outside of the school. The security will walk students to there car any time of day and will come if you need them even if it is for something silly.', ""There is always some activity going on on campus. Tons of posters and flyers are hung throughout the campus with various meetings and opportunities. Living on campus puts those students at an advantage of knowing what is going on on campus. Clubs are great for passing time. There are events clubs set up outside campus and hold on campus as well. Students can take advantage of the rec center and the free gym membership at Inwood. On weekends the university holds movie nights which is all free. There's never a boring day on campus, students just need to look and keep an open mind."", 'Sodexo Foods has been doing marvelous with meals at USF. School lunches always worry students because school meals have acquired a negative connotation during school years. The food is always made fresh and there are many options. There are different meals every time of day, so there is never the same old food everyday. The lines go by pretty quick because the arrangement is like a buffet in a way. Students pay with cash or meal plans before they get there food so it is an in-and-out ordeal. A great addition to the campus is the variation in food shops. After cafeteria hours the Bistro is opened, and once the Bistro closes the Pub opens. It offers a change of scenery and brings the campus to life.', ""Living on campus is really an added bonus of going to USF. Waking up late or weather conditions are less likely to effect students from going to class. There's more freedom and privacy in a dorm. Students experience what it would be like living on their own and gain life skills like time and stress management. There are general rules for the dorms and some vary depending on the Hall a student lives in. For instance, Motherhouse allows students of the drinking age to bring in alcohol, whereas, Marian Hall is a dry building which means no alcohol is allowed in the building. Each floor has gender based bathroom facilities, laundry room, and study lounges. Each floor has two RA's for the wings to regulate over any problems and to be an aide to students."", 'The University of Francis really focuses on academics but also wants to prepare students to be better people in life. There are many study abroad and other academia enhancement programs to add to the quality of your education. Tutors are offered in every major, so there is always help to those who need it. Teachers are fair with grading; you earn the grade you deserve. Grades really depend on how much time and effort you put into assignments, tests, and studies.', 'One thing I would say is to have great communication with staff, especially teachers, because they are the ones determining your grade and preparing you to graduate. Staying focused on studies is important because even on a small campus social life can interfere with studying. Put aside time to study for classes. For classes make sure to pay attention and understand the material so that for midterms you are prepared. Get help if you need it because the teachers do not know if you do not understand something. Apply for scholarships and stay updated on your student account for any alerts or items you need to complete. The most important piece of advice I could offer would be to have money put aside for college, even if it is a small amount, because even with scholarships and financial aid there is always a chance there will be a remaining balance on your tuition bill that could prevent registration for class terms and prevent graduation.', 'The University of Saint Francis is a wonderful school. The staff and students are very friendly and welcoming. Being a freshman, it was very accommodating to have such a warm feeling entering college. The architecture is remarkable. The quad is gorgeous with benches,lawn chairs chairs, fountains, gardens, sport courts. Food options are simple and are almost similar to a home cooked meal. The teachers are really understanding and want to help out their students as much as possible. Classes are challenging, but in a good way to enhance your learning. If a student is having trouble with their work there are tutors for every subject. There are hundreds of opportunities to get involved on campus with numerous clubs. The social aspect is a great way to network.']]",University of St Francis Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-St-Francis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/81474,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,25,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00018-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,894483055,894445076,HORIZONTAL,"07/16/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 11 out of 12 people found this review useful. 1 of 27 Monica from Oak Forest, IL Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed via Positioning, Box model, Typographic and Visual properties, such as left:10px, padding-left:1em, text-align:right, ... etc. Browsers will apply these properties AS IS regardless of the document language direction. This means in order for an international website to support RTL languages, it should adjust the entire CSS to render from right to left. For example, this is how different github would be if it was to be viewed in an RTL language: Just like a mirror, where everything gets flipped. Why RTLCSS Instead of authoring two sets of CSS files, one for each language direction.

This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold vehicles included different option combinations than your specified vehicle configuration. The data underlying the Average Paid calculation are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices.

Kilimanjaro International Airport offers all the services you would expect to find at any major airport, handled with pleasantly surprising friendliness and professionalism. The airport estate extends to 110 sq kms, a significant proportion of which has been zoned for planned, environmentally sensitive, development. The airport was privatised in 1998 and is operated by KADCO, a private limited company with shares held by the Government of Tanzania, InterConsult (a private Tanzanian Civil Engineering company); Mott MacDonald Ltd from the UK and an Investment Bank from South African.

It was the last flight of the night, and upon arrival, an airport staff asked me to step away immediately after I entered the airport and locked the door saying ""all flights are closed"". After walking around the airport and knocking on all doors and windows (being ignored by all staff), I finally talked to a random Precision Air representative who said they were closing the airport early that night and boarded the flight early. I was 1.5 hours early. 16 other people missed their flight that night. Worst of all is that there was only one KLM representative there that night at the office who did not speak English and said I had to wait for that flight to leave before I can speak to anyone. I understand this might not be the airportÃ¢Â€Â™s fault in general, but closing an airport early does not seem logical. They do not have good security.
