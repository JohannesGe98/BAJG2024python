"[['PREDICTOR RATIOS:', 'Altman Z-Score ALTMAN Z-SCOREALTMAN Z-SCORE reliably predicts whether or not a company is likely to enter into bankruptcy within one or two years: If the Z-Score is 3.0 or above - bankruptcy is not likely. If the Z-Score is 1.8 or less - bankruptcy is likely.A Z-Score between 1.8 and 3.0 is the gray area, i.e., a high degree of caution should be used. Probabilities of bankruptcy within the above ranges are 95% for one year and 70% within two years. A Z-Score between the two is the gray area. Obviously a higher Z-Score is desirable. It is best to assess each individual companys Z-Score against that of the industry. In low margin industries it is possible for Z-Scores to fall below the above. In such cases a trend comparison to the industry over consecutive time periods may be a better indicator. It should be remembered that a Z-Score is only as valid as the data from which it was derived i.e. if a company has altered or falsified their financial records/books, a Z-Score derived from those ""cooked books"" is of lesser use.', 'Sustainable Growth Rate SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATESUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE (SGR) shows how fast a company can grow using internally generated assets without issuing additional debt or equity. SGR provides a useful benchmark for judging a companys appropriate rate of growth.

Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year.

EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE).

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages. Formula: Total Long-Term Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Current-debt to Total Debt CURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBTCURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBT shows Current Liabilities as a percent of Total Debt.

Accounting ratios driven ratio analysis allow comparison of one industry/firm to another. Since ratios look at relationships inside the industry/firm, an industry/firm of one size can be directly compared to a second industry/firm (or a collection of industries/firms) which may be larger or smaller or even in a different business. Financial ratio analysis is a method of comparison not dependent on the size of either industry/firm. Financial ratios provide a broader basis for comparison than do raw numbers. However, ratios on their own, without year-to-year or other industry/firm comparative",Sample Sample Sample Sample Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.
