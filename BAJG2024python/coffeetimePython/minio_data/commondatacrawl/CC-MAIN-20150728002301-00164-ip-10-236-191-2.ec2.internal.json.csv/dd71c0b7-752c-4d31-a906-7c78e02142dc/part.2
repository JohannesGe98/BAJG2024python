Sandifer On Thursday, May 30, 2013, the world lost a truly good man. Jimmie Lee Sandifer was born on August 15, 1939, in Jacksville, Alabama. Jimmie was blessed to have found true love and happiness not once, but twice. Sadly, Jimmie outlived both marriages, but he can be reunited with them now. It is now time for Jimmie's life to be celebrated by his six children; three of whom he raised from birth and three of whom he assumed with his second marriage. Along with his travels, Jimmie served in Airborne and Elite Special Forces. After honorably serving his country with no regrets, Jimmie found the same camaraderie with the Masons and Shriners, which was a perfect fit for a man whose common thread throughout his life was putting others' wants and needs above his own. Although the government said he was disabled, it never stopped Jimmie from any of his activities, whether it would be woodworking, remodeling or any wayward classic car or truck that he promised, Ã‚Â“This is the one I will finish.Ã‚Â” Although Jimmie will be sadly missed, he will never be forgotten. Jimmie is survived by his six children, 13 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, sister, nieces, nephews, cousins, friends and a grateful nation.

The GMAT and the GRE are very different tests, but they have one thing in common. No matter which test you decide to take, you'll need to prepare if you want to get a score that admissions officers canÃ¢Â€Â™t ignore. Once you pick the test you want to take, your next step should be to choose how you want to prep for that test. We have prep options for both the GMAT and GRE to ensure you get the best score possible. What's the difference? If you want to apply to business school but don't want to take the GMAT, you may be in luck. More than 1,200 MBA programs now accept the GRE General Test in lieu of the GMAT for admissions, and that means more options for you. Admissions trends are showing that business schools are looking for applicants with more than just a background and experience in business, and that means that the GMAT is not the only test in the game anymore. Before you choose which test to take, you should find out what the schools you are applying to are looking for, and from there the choice is all up to you. The GREÃ‚Â®, GMATÃ‚Â®, business school and you. BEGIN--> Content Item Version : 7 Content Item Description: Graduate Advice - GMAT vs. GRE - Article Copy Content Item Id: 71","So how do I choose? Our goal is to help you to get into one of your top-choice business schools. We recommend you research the schools you're interested in and find out if they also accept the GRE. Click here to see the list of the 700 schools that currently accept both the GRE and the GMAT. Which test is right for me? The best way to determine whether the GMAT or GRE is better suited to your abilities is to get your feet wet with a practice test for each exam. Getting into business school is competitive and you don't want to take an actual GRE or GMAT sight unseen. We offer FREE full-length computer-adaptive diagnostic tests for both the GRE and the GMAT. Start your free GRE practice test now Start your free GMAT practice test now How will business schools use my GRE score? Since the GMAT and the GRE are completely different tests, comparing scores on the two is like comparing apples to oranges. ETS (the folks who administer the GRE) and GMAC (the folks who administer the GMAT) both use comparison tools to put studentÃ¢Â€Â™s scores into perspective, but many MBA programs use the ETS comparison tool as a benchmark.

From various forums and news sources that we have monitored, they seem to have succeeded in convincing religious and social conservatives that a main goal of this bill is the protection of homosexuals. They minimize or ignore the fact that the proposed law would also protect heterosexual and bisexual men and women from hate crimes. Further, they would protect people from violence motivated by hatred of their gender, gender identity, and degree of disability. Thus, each American would be protected from eight different bias crimes: the original set of four characteristics covered by the original 1969 hate crime bill, and these four new characteristics. We subscribe to many newsletters sponsored by conservative religious and social agencies. Before the vote on the 2007 version of the bill in the House, we could only find one that mentioned that the bill would also protect men and women on the basis of their gender, as well as disabled people, heterosexuals, bisexuals, etc. The main emphasis seems to be on homosexuals and occasionally on transsexuals.}","Fears based on: 1. prosecuting hate speech and 2. the definition of sexual orientation are covered in a separate essay Additional concerns by religious and social conservatives: Concern # 3: Bill gives gays, lesbians, and bisexuals ""special privileges:"" Conservatives often refer to the bill as giving special protection to gays and lesbians. They often ignore the fact that the proposed law would protect persons of all sexual orientations equally: i.e. heterosexuals, bisexuals and homosexuals. Of course, a hate crime law that includes sexual orientation as a protected class would most commonly be applied to assault cases on homosexuals.

Q. What organisms are used to determine pore size? What organisms are used to determine pore size? Absolute size rating describes the pore size at which a challenge organism of a particular size will be retained with 99.9% efficiency under strictly defined test conditions. Most membrane filters are rated as absolute terms. A. Nominal pore size rating describes the ability of the filter to retain the majority of the particles at the rated pore size and larger (60-9%). Glass fiber filters and screen filters are a good example of nominally rated filtration. Q. What is the difference between nominal and absolute pore size ratings? What is the difference between nominal and absolute pore size ratings? Liquids - 80 psi Gases - 55 psi A. The maximum operating pressure for the Capsule filters varies with liquids and gases. Q. What is the maximum operating pressure for the Capsule filters? What is the maximum operating pressure for the Capsule filters? A. The pore size of a filter, normally stated in micrometers (Ã‚Âµm), is determined by the diameter of a particle that is retained by the filter. This is determined using a challenge organism and/or bubble point testing. Q. How is pore size determined? How is pore size determined? A.

Ã‚Â© 2015 THEHUDDLE.COM. Part of USA TODAY Sports Digital Properties., 19235=Vernon Davis:Ã‚Â  Sure, heÃ¢Â€Â™s a Semi-Final Surprise.Ã‚Â  Davis caught 6 passes for 72 yards and 1 TD after three weeks of nothing.Ã‚Â  Earlier in the season he had another 3-week stretch of fantasy torture too.Ã‚Â  Week 15 was a surprise.Ã‚Â  IÃ¢Â€Â™m not a fan, you all know that by now.Ã‚Â  ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not personal Ã¢Â€Â“ it never is in fantasy football Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s just the numbers.Ã‚Â  Davis is 15th among TEs in targets (78) which automatically places him outside the top-10 or 12 fantasy tight ends in my book.Ã‚Â  I donÃ¢Â€Â™t care how prolific he was the last couple of years.Ã‚Â  In 2009 Davis had 129 targets Ã¢Â€Â“ Gates-type stuff Ã¢Â€Â“ and he was a juggernaut.Ã‚Â  But that was with ex-OC Jimmy Raye, and now Davis will be lucky to break 90 targets.Ã‚Â , 21314=LetÃ¢Â€Â™s get back to Ryan Fitzpatrick real quickÃ¢Â€Â¦ He got that 6-year $59 million extension in October with a reported $24 million in guarantees.Ã‚Â  However, the Bills are looking at his 1-7 record since the ink dried on that contract, and I suspect they might give him the stink eye.Ã‚Â  Did you know Buffalo could cut ties after only paying him $13.22 million in new money, not $24m?Ã‚Â  ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s right.Ã‚Â  ProFootballTalk.com reports:Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœPer a league source, the Bills could trade or cut Fitzpatrick before the seventh day of the 2012 league year and owe him nothing further than the $3.22 million base salary he was already due to earn in 2011 and the $10 million signing bonus he was paid upon inking the new deal.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â Wait, the deal was clearly advertised as $24 million in guarantees. Ã‚Â ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the key to all the NFL contracts:Ã‚Â  How much is the player guaranteed?Ã‚Â  Right?Ã‚Â  Well, wrong.Ã‚Â  In the NFL even guaranteed isnÃ¢Â€Â™t guaranteed, in the purest sense of the word.Ã‚Â  FitzpatrickÃ¢Â€Â™s 2011-2013 base salaries were partially guaranteed for injury only, around $14 million dollars worth over three years -- which if you add to his $10m signing bonus becomes that mystical Ã¢Â€Âœ$24 million in guaranteesÃ¢Â€? that was touted.Ã‚Â  But he might not even be a Buffalo Bill in 2012 if they donÃ¢Â€Â™t exercise a $5 million option bonus.Ã‚Â  They can let Fitzpatrick go and not pay another dime., 29642=WhoÃ¢Â€Â™s going to win 2011 NFL Defensive Player of the Year?Ã‚Â  HereÃ¢Â€Â™s how I have them ranked:, 10440=Here we are, baby.Ã‚Â  ItÃ¢Â€Â™s crunch time.Ã‚Â  Week 16 is The Show for probably 75% of fantasy leagues and one wrong decision can ruin everything youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been working for.Ã‚Â  DoesnÃ¢Â€Â™t it seem like we get to this point every year and lineup decisions are harder than ever?Ã‚Â  ItÃ¢Â€Â™s because of what I call the Semi-Final Surprises, those neÃ¢Â€Â™er-do-wells on your roster (or the waiver wire) that suddenly decided to score points in Week 15, the semi-finals of your playoffs.Ã‚Â  Now youÃ¢Â€Â™re forced to consider them for your all-important, gold-studded championship lineup.Ã‚Â  You know the Semi-Final Surprises well because they storm into our lives every December.Ã‚Â  Last season in Week 15 some of the SFS guys were QBs Rex Grossman & Tim Tebow, RBs Donald Brown & Tashard Choice, WRs Brian Robiskie & David Nelson, TEs Jimmy Graham & Ed Dickson.Ã‚Â  Some of them earned a spot in your Week 16 lineup, others did not because it just felt too fluky, or maybe the matchups didnÃ¢Â€Â™t look good enough, or you simply adhered to Ã¢Â€Â˜Never Bench Your StudsÃ¢Â€? theory.Ã‚Â  LetÃ¢Â€Â™s take a look back at how those SFS guys turned out in 2010:, 37068=Colts:Ã‚Â  Ann C.

Those two were also once complete no-names who got a couple starts at the end of a season Ã¢Â€Â“ and completely re-wrote their destinies.Ã‚Â  I love Bell as a flex Ã¢Â€Â“ even at RB2 in deep leagues Ã¢Â€Â“ vs. the Packers on Christmas night.Ã‚Â  Love him.Ã‚Â  QB Josh McCown will be looking for the checkdown at least 7 or 8 times.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â , 18577=Andre Roberts:Ã‚Â  The battle for the No. 2 WR gig in Arizona was won by Early Doucet over the first 7 or 8 games but lately Roberts is making a run at it.Ã‚Â  Week 13: 6 catches, 111 yards, 0 TDs.Ã‚Â  Week 14: 2 catches, 8 yards, 1 TD.Ã‚Â  Week 15: 6 catches, 60 yards, 1 TD.Ã‚Â  IÃ¢Â€Â™ve noticed heÃ¢Â€Â™s dropping into the slot in 3-WR sets while Doucet moves outside.Ã‚Â  It used to be the other way around.Ã‚Â  But before I go any further, No Ã¢Â€Â“ YouÃ¢Â€Â™re not starting Roberts in championship week, but he should be mentioned as a Dynasty prospect because Doucet is a free agent in 2012 and could be leaving., 15758=Donald Brown:Ã‚Â  His second SFS title in two yearsÃ¢Â€Â¦ in fact, the two biggest games of his career have both been in Week 15.Ã‚Â  Does his agent suddenly call him in December and say, Ã¢Â€ÂœDude, all your fairy-footinÃ¢Â€Â™ is gonna get you cut, better step it up!Ã¢Â€?Ã‚Â  IÃ¢Â€Â™m here to tell you that Brown was like an All-Pro vs. the Titans last week.Ã‚Â  I recommend flexing Brown in 12-team leagues if itÃ¢Â€Â™s between him and some long-shot WR like Titus Young or James Jones.Ã‚Â  EditorÃ¢Â€Â™s Note:Ã‚Â  When this article went to press Brown was playing vs. the Texans on Thursday night.}","Here we are, baby.Ã‚Â  ItÃ¢Â€Â™s crunch time.Ã‚Â  Week 16 is The Show for probably 75% of fantasy leagues and one wrong decision can ruin everything youÃ¢Â€Â™ve been working for.Ã‚Â  DoesnÃ¢Â€Â™t it seem like we get to this point every year and lineup decisions are harder than ever?Ã‚Â  ItÃ¢Â€Â™s because of what I call the Semi-Final Surprises, those neÃ¢Â€Â™er-do-wells on your roster (or the waiver wire) that suddenly decided to score points in Week 15, the semi-finals of your playoffs.Ã‚Â  Now youÃ¢Â€Â™re forced to consider them for your all-important, gold-studded championship lineup.Ã‚Â  You know the Semi-Final Surprises well because they storm into our lives every December.Ã‚Â  Last season in Week 15 some of the SFS guys were QBs Rex Grossman & Tim Tebow, RBs Donald Brown & Tashard Choice, WRs Brian Robiskie & David Nelson, TEs Jimmy Graham & Ed Dickson.Ã‚Â  Some of them earned a spot in your Week 16 lineup, others did not because it just felt too fluky, or maybe the matchups didnÃ¢Â€Â™t look good enough, or you simply adhered to Ã¢Â€Â˜Never Bench Your StudsÃ¢Â€? theory.Ã‚Â  LetÃ¢Â€Â™s take a look back at how those SFS guys turned out in 2010: Ã‚Â  Print Ã‚Â ","HmmmÃ¢Â€Â¦ As fate would have it, only the blessed Ã¢Â€Â“ Tim Tebow Ã¢Â€Â“ walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.Ã‚Â  HeÃ¢Â€Â™s the only SFS who repeated his success again in Week 16 last year.

QB game).Ã‚Â  So last week was a surprise for those who had long since buried Fitzpatrick on their bench.Ã‚Â  However, I watched the Bills/Dolphins game and Fitzpatrick needed Miami to go into Ã¢Â€Â˜preventÃ¢Â€Â™ at 23-7 for him to find passing lanes.Ã‚Â  His receivers donÃ¢Â€Â™t get enough separation normally.Ã‚Â  I could not start him vs. Denver.

Stefan: Well, Jeremy is the hunter, and he has to keep killing vampires to complete his mark, but we can't quite figure out how to keep him from killing us. Klaus: Sounds like quite the chore, which is why I feel perfectly justified doing a little charity work. Caroline: If we're going to be nice to each other, then I will need that glass of champagne.

Si bien los datos para 1998 son aÃƒÂºn preliminares, es poco probable que los resultados definitivos representen una modificaciÃƒÂ³n sustancial de ÃƒÂ©stos dada la amplitud de la matrÃƒÂ­cula considerada en la informaciÃƒÂ³n preliminar., 105431=Esta modificaciÃƒÂ³n normativa, se corresponde con un proceso social de ampliaciÃƒÂ³n de la escolaridad. AsÃƒÂ­, para el perÃƒÂ­odo anterior a la dÃƒÂ©cada podemos apreciar que la escolaridad promedio de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n de 15 aÃƒÂ±os y mÃƒÂ¡s, medida en aÃƒÂ±os de estudio logrados, era la siguiente: 1,9 aÃƒÂ±os en 1940; 3,1 aÃƒÂ±os en 1961; 4,4 aÃƒÂ±os en 1972 y 6,0 aÃƒÂ±os en 1981.

The Committee, which eventually established chapters in France, Great Britain, Switzerland and the United States, was founded in Vevey, Switzerland, in January 1915 by a group of eminent Poles who had planned the Committee's formation with Paderewski at his Swiss villa in Riond-Bosson. Jointly heading the Committee were Paderewski and Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916), the author of ""Quo vadis?"" and, in 1905, the first Polish laureate of the Nobel Prize for Literature. While calling upon others to assist hundreds of thousands of Poles, who were in desperate need of food, clothing and shelter, Paderewski, himself, donated more than $2 million from his own personal fortune to help his fellow countrymen.[10], 65110=[15] Walaux, Marguerite: The National Music of Poland - Its Character and Sources, 1916, p. 13. [Back], 73017=The last category of my contributions to scholarly meetings is giving individual papers, mostly as an invited scholar. The organizers of many of these events know about my work and ask me to speak about a specific topic or about anything I would like to talk. I enjoy these opportunities of preparing presentations based on my earlier research and of branching out in somewhat new directions. Since coming to USC, I have read papers as an invited scholar at conferences in Warsaw (1997, on Lutoslawski's ideas of death), Heidelberg (1998, on the use of medieval anthem by contemporary composers), Chapel Hill, N.C. (1998, on Gorecki, national identity and ethnic musics), Santa Cruz (1998, on Gorecki's notions of motherhood), San Diego (1999, on Ptaszynska's colorful use of percussion). I was also scheduled to appear at two events that I regretfully had to miss: in Cracow (1998, paper on Penderecki's opera Ubu Rex), Cologne (1998, paper on Ptaszynska's song cycle, Liquid Light). These papers, sent in as complete packages, with handouts, musical examples, transparencies, were read by others. Most of these conference papers have already been prepared as book chapters or articles for music journals to appear in print this year and in 2000. The revisions take into account interesting new ideas, additions and changes suggested by listeners during the discussion period after each paper was read. Thus, the scholarly meetings provide a ""laboratory"" for research and stimulate the presence of Polish music topics in music history literature published around the world., 50240=The second national tune ""With the Smoke of Fire"" or ""Chorale"" came into being following the Austrian Army's bloody suppression of the Cracow Uprising of 1846. As a national song, it best conveys the patriotic agony which the Polish nation experienced during the 123-year-long period of partitions by the Russian, Prussian and Austro-Hungarian Empires.[16] Sung at both patriotic manifestations and at church services, the occupying powers soon forbade the public singing of this hymn. Punishment for performing the hymn was severest in the Prussian territories., 33988=As the war came to an end, Feliks Nowowiejski (1877-1946) wrote an organ prelude entitled Friede, schÃƒÂ¶nstes GlÃƒÂ¼ck der Erde, op. 31 nr. 5, which was based on the Schubert lied of the same title.

The concert included Polish religious music, chants from the Orthodox church, Italian and Spanish folk arrangements, and American spirituals., 63131=[2] Davies, Norman: God's Playground - A History of Poland, Volume II, 1981, p. 378. [Back], 40454=Elgar would not be the last famous composer to write a work entitled ""Polonia"".[8] In fact, it was Elgar's composition which became a source of consolation and inspiration for one of Poland's greatest composers and conductors of the second half of the 20th century - Andrzej Panufnik (1914-1990). In search of political and artistic freedom, Panufnik escaped to the West and settled in England in 1954. As a conductor and Musical Director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra,he was responsible for a revival of Elgar's work during the 1957-58 season. Also showing Panufnik's affinity for ""Polonia"" is a 1997 BBC Radio Classics recording with Sir Andrzej conducting it in a 1978 performance with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra. As a composer,though, Panufnik gave credit to Elgar for his own 1959 orchestral work of the same title. In his autobiography Panufnik writes:[9], 18634=The number of internet resources for Polish recordings is growing rapidly. A new online store, named ""Skok"" (which means ""jump"" in Polish) presents the most comprehensive catalogue of Polish music on CDs on the Internet. More than 2600 Polish titles are included in their Polish CD catalogue and the catalogue is constantly growing. As the only one store on the net SKOK also includes discontinued editions of CDs to keep Polish music lovers well informed - a good source of information for CD collectors., 50873=Elgar uses this melody twice in its entirety in his symphonic prelude. The first time is after Elgar's ""nobilmente"" original thematic material, which immediately follows the introduction, and the second time is just prior to the finale containing what is now known as the Polish National Anthem - ""The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka"". Almost 30 years later, this hymn would be used once again to give the Poles courage when Radio London signaled the partisans in the nation's capital to begin the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944.[17] The Chorale written by Nikorowicz was sung to the tragic text of Kornel Ujejski (1823-1897)., 71870=But organizing scholarly meetings in Los Angeles is just one aspect of this part of my work. Since 1996, I have proposed several sessions for the programs of scholarly meetings elsewhere; these sessions included my own papers as well as contributions by scholars that I invited to join me for these occasions - in London, England in 1997 (16th Congress of the International Musicological Society, session on contemporary music), in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997 (Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society, session on Lutoslawski), in Fort Worth, Texas in 1999 (Annual Meeting of the Society for American Music, session on Polish immigrants). The impact of a session at a major academic event is much larger than that of an individual paper - sessions have individual titles and slots clearly marked in the program book. It is hard to miss them. That is why I decided to propose a Special Session on ""Polish Identity and Music"" for the 1999 Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society which will be held this November. The proposal was accepted and I will report the session's progress and impact in the future., 159=Polish Music Reference Center Newsletter August 1999, Vol. 5, no. 8 ISSN 1098-9188, 28267=The Great War (1914-18) did not inspire many Polish composers to write music ""for the cause."" If one recalls the political situation and borders of a non-existent Poland of that time, the explanation for this is simple. At the outbreak of the First World War, Poland had not existed as a sovereign nation for over a century. It had been partitioned by three of its neighbors and placed under their jurisdiction; these were the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires. A public performance of a Polish patriotic composition in the partitioned lands would have been illegal and, for all practical purposes, impossible to organize. Turning the divided Polish nation into a battlefield also created a moral dilemma for the Poles who were forced to fight in the armies of their imperial rulers: that of having to go into battle and kill fellow Poles. At the war's outset, 725,000 Poles in the Russian, 571,000 in the Austrian, and 250,000 in the Prussian partitions were drafted into those countries' armies.[1] Even though each of the powers promised the Poles some form of autonomy after the ""victory"" if they would fight for their side during the war[2], writing music for their cause would have been promoting Polish fratricide as well. Moral support for the Polish cause through music would have to come from abroad., 49918=""The 1905 Warszawianka"" (used by permission of Grupa Wydawnicza ""SÃ…Â‚owo"".) [Here, you may also see a larger image]., 22237=The 31st Annual International Polka Festival Convention was held between 29 July and 1 August at the Westin Hotel O'Hare in Rosemont, Illinois., 48029=In the introduction to the full score of ""Polonia"" Jerrold Northrop Moore states that it was MÃ…Â‚ynarski who proposed the Polish national melodies to be used, but that it was Elgar who selected the quotations from Chopin and Paderewski. These national melodies will surely be unfamiliar to the non-Polish listener. The ""1905 Warszawianka"" is the first song used in the introduction of the fantasia. It is the two-measure dotted-rhythm melody which is first heard in measure no. 4 as played by the bassoons and bass clarinet. Later, it is not only used as a transitional motif between sections of the fantasia, but the motif is also developed in two separate sections of the composition which give a unifying force to the work. Although the text of the song itself dates from the 19th century and was written by WacÃ…?aw Ã…ÂšwiÃ„Â™cicki (1848-1900), it became popular when sung to a melody by JÃƒÂ³zef PÃ…Â‚awiÃ…Â„ski and was used as an uprising song against the Russians in Warsaw in 1905. This song became popular with workers' movements throughout Europe. It was translated into over a dozen languages and accompanied the revolutionary communist movement in many European countries.[15] The following hymn and the other Polish national hymns given below in English have been translated by the author., 4697=This information should be complemented with two recent news items: she was commissioned to write a piece to celebrate the 1000 anniversary of her home city of Gdansk and composed a monumental work for the 1999 visit of Pope John Paul II to Poland., 78327=The second scholarly conference held in the month of June that I contributed to was the 57th Meeting of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America, held at Fordham University, New York. I have been a member of this venerable institution since coming to the U.S. (I had been involved in the activities of its Canadian sibling, based in Montreal) but it was my first meeting. I should mention here that it was perfectly well organized by Dr. Thaddeus Gromada and his team and that it was a very enjoyable occasion for all the participants. The PMRC was also represented by Prof. Diane Wilk, our Associate Director, who serves on the Advisory Board of PIASA., 44920=[Ignacy Jan Paderewski, photo taken from an American postcard printed c. 1910. From the archives of the Paderewski Museum, Warsaw; used by permission.], 38186=Instead, he uses Polish dances - a mazurka in the third and a krakowiak in the fourth movements - and also employs the 13th century hymn to the Blessed Virgin Mary ""Bogurodzica"" (Mother of God) which is still well known and sung by Poles today. This hymn, which has the distinction of being the oldest recorded Polish melody and poetry in existence, was sung by Polish warriors as they went into battle against the Teutonic Knights. The first seven notes of the medieval Bogurodzica are the exact same seven pitches of the opening theme of the ""Kyrie in Ralph Vaughan Williams' Mass in G minor"" of 1922 (see example 1 below). The premiere of MÃ…Â‚ynarski's ""Polonia"" took place on February 6, 1911, in Glasgow with the Scottish Symphony Orchestra performing and the composer at the orchestra's helm., 35430=Paderewski, to whom Elgar's Polish fantasia is dedicated, wrote his Symphony in B minor, op. 24 and gave it the name ""Polonia"" as well. The symphony - Paderewski's only work in this genre - was inspired by the 40th anniversary of the 1863-64 Polish Uprising and completed in 1909. The symphony was premiered in Boston on January 12, 1909, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Max Fiedler. Paderewski uses the Polish National Anthem as well in this work. Unlike Elgar, however, who uses the hymn in its entirety, or Wagner and Liszt who write variations on the melody, Paderewski uses a motif from the hymn in the symphony's last movement Vivace. The motif is discretely employed, one might even say - cleverly hidden - as a ""hope leitmotif"" for the rebirth of Poland. Even listeners who are familiar with the opening phrase of the Polish hymn and its text ""Jeszcze Polska nie zginÃ„Â™la, kiedy my Ã…Â¼yjemy"" (Poland has not yet been lost so long as we still shall live) might easily let Paderewski's use of the motif pass without recognizing it., 64414=[11] Moore, Jerrold Northrop: ""Preface to the Full Score of Polonia"" in the Elgar Complete Edition, vol. 33, 1992, p. xi.[Back], 64298=[10] McGinty, Brian: Paderewski, 1976, p. 125.

The anthem's alternative title, ""The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka"", refers to General Jan Henryk DÃ„Â…browski, the leader of the Polish Legions who fought for Napoleon Bonaparte. The hymn dates from 1797 and was written in Reggio Emilia, Italy, by JÃƒÂ³zef Wybicki (1747-1822). The tune given to the hymn was a popular Polish folk melody. As it was sung by the legionnaires in their battles and journeys, the melody stayed with the Slavs in what is known as Yugoslavia and became the tune of their national hymn as well. The Serbs, however, sing it at a much slower tempo than the Poles do. For those familiar with the Polish national hymn today, it might sound as though Elgar ornamented the melody. Actually, this is the way the melody existed prior to 1918. Immediately following the establishment of the Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Education was given the task of making the melody easier for school children to sing. The passing notes heard in the last phrase of Elgar's setting of the hymn are noticeably missing in the post-war version. Although competitions were held after the war to search for a new national hymn, ""The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka"" became the official hymn on February 26, 1927. A translation of the hymn follows:, 11759=The promotional newsletter is entitled ""Quarta"" and the first issue appeared in May 1999. It includes numerous bits of information about Bacewicz and her anniversary events in Poland. Among the quoted artists and scholars who admired her work are composer Witold Lutoslawski and pianist Krystian Zimerman. The latter states: ""I am very much fascinated by both of the piano quintets by GraÃ…Â¼yna Bacewicz, which in my opinion are amongst the best works of this composer and, as far as the chamber music repertoire is concerned, are indeed works ofo world stature."", 47262=The thematic material for Elgar's composition is drawn from both traditional Polish tunes and from compositions by Frederic Chopin and Paderewski. The former include ""Ã…ÂšmiaÃ…Â‚o podnieÃ…Â›my sztandar nasz w gÃƒÂ³rÃ„Â™"" (Bravely Let Us Lift up Our Flag) also known as the ""1905 Warszawianka"" by JÃƒÂ³zef PÃ…Â‚awiÃ…Â„ski, ""Z dymem poÃ…Â¼arÃƒÂ³w"" (With the Smoke of Fires) also known as Chorale by JÃƒÂ³zef Nikorowicz (1827-1890) and ""The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka"" which has been the Poles' national hymn since the regaining of Polish independence. The latter group includes the opening theme from Paderewski's Polish Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, op. 19 and a quotation from Chopin's Nocturne no. 11 in G minor, op. 37 no.1., 74626=Nonetheless, local events are very important for us in Southern California and I am very pleased to report that a major artistic celebration of Polish culture is being prepared at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the year 2002. A major exhibition will feature little-known modernist works from the years 1910-1930 and created in Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic. There will be numerous Polish exhibits there, and the selection process is now in full swing. Dr. Monika Krol represents LACMA in this undertaking, led by the Exhibition Curator, Dr. Timothy Benson. The preparation stage of this major artistic event included an international symposium, entitled ""Exhibiting Central European Modernism"" and organized jointly by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Center for Russian and East European Studies at UCLA. So what I was doing at this event? Dr. Monika Krol, who attended our conference on Polish-Jewish music in the fall of 1998, invited me to discuss musical modernism in the context of artistic innovations in Poland. Since I am not an art historian, but a music historian, I decided to investigate the links between experimental artists and musicians, the possible connections and influences of ideas created by the constructivists, formists and suprematists on composers of their, or later time. After a preliminary survey, I realized that the ""later"" is the key word here: I have found very few examples of interactions of contemporaneous avant-garde, experimental artists and composers., 79004=Since the year 1999 marks the 150th anniversary of the death of Fryderyk Chopin I proposed a special session celebrating the music of our greatest composer. I served as the session chair and talked about the reception of Chopin's music among women composers (Maria Szymanowska, Pauline Viardot, Clara Schuman, Natalia Janotha, Grazyna Bacewicz). Prof. Halina Goldberg (Indiana University, Bloomington) discussed the context for Chopin's music provided by Warsaw salons - that he attended and performed in before leaving the country. She challenged the prevailing western image of Warsaw as a provincial city, pointing out the variety and number of artistic projects and salon meetings that were held in the capital of Russian occupied part of Poland. The final presenter at the session, Ms. Barbara Milewski (Princeton University) talked about the concept of folk music and its relation to Chopin's mazurkas. She questioned the myth of a strong direct link between Chopin's music and that created by the peasants in the country, pointing out instead the connections between Chopin's artistic creations and their context in little-known art music of Poland of his time (precedents of Szymanowska, Elsner, Kurpinski, etc.). Her thesis will certainly be very controversial, as it challenges the dominant ""class-based"" beliefs about the sources of national culture., 63815=[7] JasiÃ…Â„ski, Roman: Na przeÃ…Â‚omie epok - Muzyka w Warszawie (1910-1927), 1979, p. 282.[Back], 42210=Elgar's compassion for the Poles' tragic suffering during the war served as an example for other English composers to make their own Polish musical statements in kind. Arnold Bax (1883-1953) saw a similar need to help the Poles during World War Two (1939-45). Bax's response was ""Five Fantasies on Polish Christmas Carols"" which were dedicated ""To the Children of Poland"" and scored for unison chorus and string orchestra. As Jan SliwiÃ…Â„ski writes in the preface of the piano-vocal score of the Bax carols, the composer's arrangements were ""...meant to turn the blood of war into the balm of love. British children were to have sung them in aid of their starving Polish brothers and sisters."" Another British composer, Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), also moved by the plight which Polish children experienced during WW II, took up the same theme in his choral work ""The Children's Crusade, op. 82"". Scored for children's voices, percussion, two pianos and electronic organ, this ballad is a setting in English of Bertolt Brecht's Kinderkreuzzug. It begins, ""In Poland, in 1939, there was the bloodiest fight."" The world premiere of Britten's work took place in 1969 on the 50th anniversary of Save the Children Fund, a British charity which was founded by Eglantyne Jebb to save starving Austrian children who were victims of a blockade imposed after the First World War., 4050=Sikora received numerous prizes, among others at the Composers Competition in Dresden for her opera Ariadna 1977), at the Experimental Music Competition in Bourges for Waste Land (1982), and Letters to M.(1980), at Young Composers Competition in Warsaw for ...according to Pascal (1976)and at the Women Composers Competition in Mannheim for Guernica ( 1975-1979). Her most recent commission was a cantata celebrating the millennium of her native city of Gdansk. At present she is a professor of electronic music at the Music Conservatory in Angouleme., 46840=The world premiere of Elgar's ""Polonia"" took place on July 6, 1915, with Sir Edward conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at Queen's Hall in London in a benefit concert for the Polish Victims Relief Fund. Other works on the concert included one movement from MÃ…Â‚ynarski's ""Polonia"" Symphony and Paderewski's ""Polish Fantasy on Original Themes for Piano and Orchestra, op. 19.14"", 34387=It was with Edward Elgar's fantasia on Polish national airs, though, that the most outstanding, dramatic and nobly patriotic musical gesture for the Polish cause came into being during the First World War. Elgar, however, was not the first composer to have written a work entitled ""Polonia"". The young Richard Wagner (1813-83), at one time sympathetic to Poland's fate, wrote an overture bearing the same title in 1836. In 1883, Franz Liszt (1811-86) also wrote a work entitled ""Salve, Polonia"", an orchestral interlude from his uncompleted oratorio ""The Legend of St. Stanislaus"". All three compositions by Elgar, Wagner and Liszt make use of The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka, the hymn which was to become Poland's national anthem after it regained its independence. The title of Elgar's work, though, may not have come from the earlier works of Wagner and Liszt, but rather from compositions of the two Polish musicians most closely associated with the creation of Elgar's piece: Paderewski and Emil MÃ…Â‚ynarski., 31199=[Image on the left, above: ""Polonia"" 1918 by the Polish artist Jacek Malczewski (1854-1929). From a cycle of paintings entitled ""Polonia"" which were painted during WW I. This one depicts Poland with her crown restored and robed with a legionnaire's coat. Behind ""Polonia"" are the unshackled feet of a Pole climbing a set of stairs.

Top prize winners to represent the United States will receive all expenses paid, including airfare, to the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland in October, 2000., 61763=Inasmuch as anniversaries present an opportunity to remember and learn from the past, let this 80th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice not only make us recall the horror and tragedy of that Great War, but let it also make us cherish Elgar's musical response to the plight of a people whose once and future nation was often forgotten and who suffered so horribly in the shadows of the principal players of that terrible world conflict. In October 1999, as the musical world celebrates another anniversary - the sesquicentennial of Frederic Chopin's death - it will again have the opportunity to reassess another Elgar composition recalling how this English musical giant saluted Poland's most famous composer by orchestrating the ""Funeral March"" from his ""Sonata in B-flat minor""., 15225=Masterclasses International has scheduled an International Piano Symposium dedicated to Chopin for August 1-8, 1999 at the Pepperdine University Campus in Malibu, California.

The poem by Zygmunt KrasiÃ…Â„ski (1812-59) on which the cantata is based is addressed to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Using the appellation ""Queen of Poland"" - a title which for centuries the Vatican has allowed Poles to use in the recitation of the Litany of Loreto - the poet calls upon Mary to ""End thou for bleeding Poland her deep anguish."", 83599=Copyright 1999 by the Polish Music Reference Center Send your comments and inquiries to: polmusic@usc.edu, 39249=In addition to being a composer, MÃ…Â‚ynarski was also a famous conductor and it is for his role in this profession that he is best remembered today. He was the first conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra (1901-05). In the first decade of the 20th century he guest conducted in Russia and in the British cities of London, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. From 1910-15 he was the music director of the Scottish Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow. His association with Elgar also included collaborating with him and Thomas Beecham in presenting a three-day festival of British music in 1915.[6] It would also be MÃ…Â‚ynarski who would conduct the first Polish performance of ""Polonia"" at the Philharmonic Hall in Warsaw during the final days of the war on October 4, 1918.[7] Following the war, MÃ…Â‚ynarski's responsibilities included the directorship of both the Opera House (Teatr Wielki) and the Music Conservatory in Warsaw. After the war his guest conducting took him to the capitals of Europe and to major cities in America, where he joined the faculty of the Curtis School of Music in Philadelphia in 1929., 64982=[15] Panek, WacÃ…Â‚aw: Polski Ã…Âšpiewnik Narodowy, 1996, p. 201.[Back]}","A listening guide for ""Polonia"" follows. The form of the piece is a free design. The work is scored for full symphonic orchestra and includes the following instrumentation: 2 flutes (2nd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, percussion (6 players), 2 harps, organ and strings. ]. The last phrase of the Polish National Anthem ""Jeszcze Polska nie zginÃ„Â™Ã…Â‚a"". The first example shows how it was sung prior to 1927, while the second example illustrates how it is sung today. [Here, you may also see a larger image Poland has not yet been lost So long as we still shall live. That which foreign force has seized We shall regain by the sword. March, march DÃ„Â…browski! From Italy to Poland! Under your command Let us rejoin the nation. The last national tune used by Elgar is the Polish National Anthem which forms the basis of the fantasia's triumphant finale. The anthem's alternative title, ""The DÃ„Â…browski Mazurka"", refers to General Jan Henryk DÃ„Â…browski, the leader of the Polish Legions who fought for Napoleon Bonaparte. The hymn dates from 1797 and was written in Reggio Emilia, Italy, by JÃƒÂ³zef Wybicki (1747-1822). The tune given to the hymn","Inasmuch as anniversaries present an opportunity to remember and learn from the past, let this 80th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice not only make us recall the horror and tragedy of that Great War, but let it also make us cherish Elgar's musical response to the plight of a people whose once and future nation was often forgotten and who suffered so horribly in the shadows of the principal players of that terrible world conflict.

Microturbines were derived from turbocharger technologies found in large trucks or the turbines in aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs). See also Microturbines.', 'Combustion Turbines Conventional combustion turbine (CT) generators typically range in size from about 500 kW up to 25 MW for DER, and up to approximately 250 MW for central power generation. They are fueled by natural gas, oil, or a combination of fuels (""dual fuel""). Modern single-cycle combustion turbine units typically have efficiencies in the range of 20 to 45% at full load. Efficiency is somewhat lower at less than full load.', 'Internal Combustion Engines A reciprocating, or internal combustion (IC), engine converts the energy contained in a fuel into mechanical power. This mechanical power is used to turn a shaft in the engine. A generator is attached to the IC engine to convert the rotational motion into power. They are available from small sizes (e.g., 5 kW for residential back-up generation) to large generators (e.g., 7 MW). Reciprocating engines use commonly available fuels such as gasoline, natural gas, and diesel fuel.', 'Stirling Engines Stirling engines are classed as external combustion engines. They are sealed systems with an inert working fluid, usually either helium or hydrogen.

In addition to providing power, they can supply a thermal energy source for water and space heating, or absorption cooling. In demonstration projects, fuel cells have been shown to reduce facility energy service costs by 20% to 40% over conventional energy service. See also Fuel Cell Technology.', 'Energy Storage/UPS Systems Energy storage technologies produce no net energy but can provide electric power over short periods of time. They are used to correct voltage sags, flicker, and surges that occur when utilities or customers switch suppliers or loads. They may also be used as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). As such, energy storage technologies are considered to be a distributed energy resource.', 'Photovoltaic Systems Photovoltaic (PV) cells, or solar cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity. PV cells are assembled into flat plate systems that can be mounted on rooftops or other sunny areas. They generate electricity with no moving parts, operate quietly with no emissions, and require little maintenance. See also Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV).', 'Wind Systems Wind turbines use the wind to produce electrical power. A turbine with fan blades is placed at the top of a tall tower. The tower is tall in order to harness the wind at a greater velocity, free of turbulence caused by interference from obstacles such as trees, hills, and buildings. As the turbine rotates in the wind, a generator produces electrical power. A single wind turbine can range in size from a few kW for residential applications to more than 5 MW.', 'Hybrid Systems Developers and manufacturers of DER are looking for ways to combine technologies to improve performance and efficiency of distributed generation equipment.

If NPH goes unidentified and untreated it can cause severe disability. The cause of this disease is poorly understood. It may involve damage caused by impaired blood flow in the brain. The standard methods by which we diagnose patients who have symptoms of NPH are less accurate than desired. Many times patients remain undiagnosed or untreated while others receive treatment due to a false-positive diagnosis. To treat NPH, a small tube called a 'shunt' can be surgically placed in the brain to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and help relieve symptoms. Currently, the reported response rates to shunting vary from 31% to 89%. Follow-up studies have shown that the shunts may not work long-term. This could be due to the natural history of the disease, development of other diseases, or due to a short term 'placebo effect' following the shunt placement surgery. Our group is doing a study of patients with NPH. All participants in this study will have a shunt placed. These shunts are programmable and, once placed, may be opened or closed by the doctor. Programming the shunt does not require an additional surgical procedure. All study participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have their shunts open and draining. The other group will have their shunts closed (not draining). After",False,-1,0,,

He won the tournament in 2007 and has a total of eight top ten finishes.[7] The tournament, televised by NBC in July, is played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Lake Tahoe.[8] Chandler helped coach the boy's golf team at Torrey Pines High School, where his oldest daughter Ryann plays on the volleyball team.[9][10], 9117=Christopher Mark Chandler[1] (born October 12, 1965) is a retired American football player, who played as a quarterback in the National Football League for 17 seasons. He is known for leading the Atlanta Falcons to a 14-2 season in 1998, followed up with an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII., 15276=Chandler was taken in the third round of the draft by the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts deemed Chandler expendable due to his poor play, and the fact that they selected Jeff George with the first overall choice in the 1990 draft. Chandler was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1990 for a 1st round draft choice that turned out to be the 2nd overall pick (The Colts also had the 1st pick the same year. The pick that they got for Chandler they used on Quentin Coryatt). Chandler was cut during the 1991 season. As a Buccaneer, he had an 0-6 record as a starter, threw for 5 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 44.9.[4], 20266=In 2002, Chandler was picked up by the Chicago Bears, and spent two seasons there before rejoining the Rams, who had moved to St. Louis. In his first start as a Ram in 2004, he threw six interceptions, a team record. The following week, his poor play led to coach Mike Martz saying, ""It is tragic that, that position [when played by Chandler] holds this team hostage.""[5] As a result, Chandler was the first Ram to be released in the off-season, saving St. Louis $665,000 in cap space., 13916=Chandler played in the NFL for 17 seasons, from 1988 to 2004. He played for eight teams, a record shared with Mark Royals, Karl Wilson, and Jeff Brady (although Chandler is the only player to have started for eight different teams). He threw for 28,484 yards, and had a career passer rating of 79.1.[2] He has thrown at least one touchdown pass for seven different franchises, an NFL record.[3] At the time of his retirement, he was ranked 30th in all-time pass completions, with 2328. He was continually bothered by injuries, which earned him the moniker of ""Crystal Chandelier"" amongst his detractors., 21530=Chandler lives in San Diego and was married to Diane Brodie, a former college tennis player at USC and daughter of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback John Brodie.[6] They have three daughters: Ryann, Skye, and Brynn. The couple separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. They each still live in Del Mar, California in separate residences., 18675=Following the 2000 season, Chandler's record as a starting Atlanta quarterback was 28-25, which prompted the Falcons to consider recruiting a new quarterback. Atlanta held the fifth overall pick in the 2001 draft, and traded the pick to the San Diego Chargers, along with Tim Dwight, a third round pick in 2001, and a 2002 second round pick (which became Reche Caldwell). In return, Atlanta received the first overall pick in the 2001 draft, which they used to select quarterback Michael Vick. Still, Chandler started most of the 2001 season, but was replaced by Vick in 2002 as the starting quarterback. Due to mediocre play, bloated salary, and being replaced by Vick, the Falcons opted to make Chandler eligible for selection by the Houston Texans in the 2002 Expansion Draft, with hopes of Chandler being picked up by the new team. Chandler left the Falcons ranked third in team history with 13,268 passing yards, but never achieved back-to-back winning seasons., 12205=In college, Chandler played at the University of Washington from 1984 to 1987. He finished third in the school's history in total offense with 4,442 yards and 32 touchdown passes, and ended his college career as the Offensive Player of the Game at the 1988 Senior Bowl. He graduated with an economics degree., 16414=From 1992 to 1994 he played reasonably well as a starter and backup for the Phoenix Cardinals and the Los Angeles Rams. After joining the Houston Oilers in 1995, he would earn the starting job. His highlight with the team came on September 24, 1995 at Cincinnati. In the Oilers' 38-28 victory Chandler threw for 352 yards and 4 touchdowns, and earned a perfect passer rating of 158.3 after completing 23 of 26 passes. However, late in 1996, Jeff Fisher decided that Steve McNair was ready to start, and Chandler was traded to the Atlanta Falcons for a fourth-round draft choice., 11863=Chandler was born on October 12, 1965, in Everett, Washington. In high school, he was active in basketball, football, track and golf. As a high school quarterback, Chandler threw for 2,000 yards and 49 touchdowns., 17835=Chandler's best seasons were with Atlanta, when he was coached by Dan Reeves. Chandler was a Pro Bowl quarterback in 1997 and 1998. The 1998 season saw Chandler lead the Falcons to their only Super Bowl appearance, though Atlanta lost to John Elway and the Denver Broncos (coached by Mike Shanahan). In 1998, Chandler's 9.65 yards-per-attempt figure was the highest single-season YPA of any quarterback in the 1990s with 300+ passing attempts.}","Statistics[edit] In college, Chandler played at the University of Washington from 1984 to 1987.

As a result Monarch Airlines ceased long-haul and charter operations by April 2015, converting to a low cost model focusing on short-haul leisure routes.[66], 35571=In 2003, Monarch Scheduled announced that it would open a new base at Gatwick Airport. The base opened on 1 May 2003 with services to Alicante, Faro and MÃƒÂ¡laga.[41], 54716=On 1 July 2013, Monarch announced an order for a further two Airbus A321s. The aircraft were due to be delivered in April and May 2015, but the order was changed to just 1 A320 which was delivered in April 2015. On 12 December 2013, Monarch announced that Monarch Airlines had returned to profit in year ending October 2013 and announced that passenger numbers were up 9.5% to 7 million and in line to carry more than 10 million by 2016. In the same announcement Monarch confirmed that it plans to order 60 new aircraft in an order worth $6 Billion for delivery up to 2024 and would announce the successful tender in Q1 of 2014 from either Airbus/Boeing and Bombardier. In July 2014 the airline accordingly announced as part of its fleet replacement plans that it had selected Boeing with the Boeing 737MAX as the preferred bidder for 30 aircraft.[62] The order was then confirmed late October 2014 and deliveries are due to take place Q2 of 2018.[63], 58914=Monarch Airlines was a wholly owned subsidiary of Monarch Holdings,[67] which in turn was 100%-owned by the Globus Travel Group.[9][13] As of mid-2012, Globus Travel's shareholders included Amerald Investments (88%), Atlantic Financial Services (7%) and Abaco Holdings (4%)., 31695=In 1998, Monarch Airlines leased two McDonnell Douglas MD-11 widebodied aircraft from World Airways for its long-haul operations whilst awaiting the delivery of a pair of new Airbus A330-200 widebodies. Following the A330s arrival in 1999,[37][38][39] Monarch returned the MD-11s to World Airways.[14][40] The new A330 widebodies permitted Monarch to serve long-haul charter destinations with a two class seating configuration, another first for the airline.[14][39], 12735=Monarch Airlines was formed on 5 June 1967 with financial backing from the Swiss Mantegazza family, as a subsidiary of Globus Getaway Holdings.[7][8] At the time of Monarch's inception, the Mantegazza family were the owners of UK-based tour operator Cosmos Tours.[9][10], 24454=In 1981, new stations were opened at Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester and Berlin Tegel.[14][26] This was the first time Monarch Airlines carried a million passengers in a single year. 1981 was also the year Monarch became the first charter airline to order the Boeing 757-200, a high-capacity, medium-haul single-aisle plane powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535C engines.[27] Monarch's 757 order represented a major step change for a small airline.[28] Its first 757 was delivered and entered service in the spring of 1983.[28] This coincided with the introduction of an updated livery, the third in the airline's history., 40288=To operate scheduled services from Manchester, an Airbus A321 was acquired. Monarch became the airport's second-largest passenger airline in 2005 with 1.72m passengers using its services from/to the airport.[45] Monarch's total passenger numbers increased from 4.55m in 2002[46] to 6.5m in 2008.[47], 51829=On 3 May 2012, Monarch announced that they were to open a new base at East Midlands Airport in Autumn 2012, to replace some routes previously flown by Bmibaby, who ceased operations completely on 9 September 2012.[59] On 8 May 2012 the airline announced operations from Leeds/Bradford with 2 new winter destinations, Munich and Grenoble. They also announced plans for a large expansion in summer 2013. [60] On 10 July 2012, it was announced that Monarch were to launch a new base at Leeds/Bradford with 12 new destinations.[61] The base opened on 22 March 2013. On 13 December 2012 Monarch announced that they have come on board as a new sponsor for Leeds United AFC, working in partnership with Leeds United to promote Monarch's new base and routes at Leeds Bradford Airport., 36655=In November 2005, Monarch opened a base in MÃƒÂ¡laga.[42] The airline based one Airbus A320 aircraft there. Monarch launched three scheduled services from MÃƒÂ¡laga, to Aberdeen, Blackpool and Newquay. The Newquay service was discontinued on 30 April 2006. About a year later, scheduled services from MÃƒÂ¡laga to Blackpool were also dropped due to low demand. On 27 October 2007, flights to Aberdeen were withdrawn as well.[43] This resulted in closure of Monarch's MÃƒÂ¡laga base., 34804=Monarch's sole McDonnell Douglas DC-10 was retired from service in 2002 and was donated to Manchester Airport Aviation Viewing Park. In 2002, Monarch also unveiled a brand-new livery Ã¢Â€Â“ the airline's fourth. Also, the company re-branded its Monarch Crown Service scheduled division as Monarch Scheduled.[14] Monarch Scheduled continued to offer a full service product, including free catering, bar service, hot towels, newspapers and in-flight entertainment (IFE)., 39027=On 15 December 2004, Monarch Scheduled announced that it would open a new base at Birmingham Airport. The base opened in April 2005 with new routes to MÃƒÂ¡laga and Tenerife.[44], 40900=In August 2006, Monarch ordered six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner widebodied jets, primarily for use on long-haul routes. Delivery was planned to start in 2010; however, delays to the 787 project pushed back delivery to 2013,[48][49] and in September 2011, the airline cancelled the order citing its strategic decision to concentrate on short-/medium-haul operations.[50][51], 28214=1988 was the first time Monarch Airlines carried more than two million passengers in a year.[14], 29759=In 1990, Monarch Airlines introduced the Airbus A300-600R, its first widebodied aircraft type, and opened a new purpose-built headquarters that also housed the airline's own Boeing 757 flight simulator at its Luton base.[14][31], 56422=On 14 August 2014, Monarch announced the closure of their East Midlands base.[65] Monarch Airlines carried over seven million passengers during 2014, around 6.3 million travelling on scheduled flights and 750,000 on charter flights operated by the airline.[4], 25999=In spring 1985, the CAA awarded Monarch Airlines licences to begin scheduled services to MÃƒÂ¡laga, Minorca and Tenerife. This enabled the airline to launch its first-ever scheduled service from Luton to Minorca on 5 July 1986, under the brand name Monarch crown service.[14], 50442=On 3 November 2011, Monarch received a Ã‚Â£75m rescue package for the airline. It was then announced that Monarch were to launch of 14 additional routes serving new destinations in Italy, Croatia and Greece from their bases. The new flights commenced at the start of the 2012 summer season. Monarch also received two Airbus A320 aircraft to support the increased level of activity. The addition of these aircraft also marks the first stage of a medium-term plan to increase the fleet size to 40 aircraft in support of the airline's goal to carry 10 million passengers annually by the time the final stage has been fully implemented. Growing the fleet to enable an increase in passenger numbers will allow the airline to spread its fixed costs over a higher level of output, thus resulting in greater economies of scale.[56][57][58], 49546=Although Monarch made a Ã‚Â£1.4m profit in 2010, it reported a Ã‚Â£45m loss in the financial year ending 31 October 2011 as a result of high jet fuel prices against the backdrop of a stagnant economy and political turmoil in the Middle East. Higher fuel prices increased the airline's annual fuel bill by Ã‚Â£50m., 30939=In 1993, Monarch Airlines introduced the first Airbus A320 aircraft into its fleet. (The first of the larger Airbus A321s joined Monarch's fleet in 1997.)[34] Airbus A320 family aircraft eventually replaced the airline's Boeing 737-300s.[35][36], 5857=Monarch Airlines carried over seven million passengers during 2014, a 3% increase compared with 2013 and a record total for the airline.[4] In June 2010, the airline was ranked 58th in the Sunday Times Top Track 100 listing the biggest privately held[a] British companies in terms of their sales.[5] The company holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.[6], 14731=The airline acquired additional Britannias from the administrators of British Eagle in 1969, its second year of operation.[13] This was the first time the company carried 250,000 passengers within a 12-month period utilising a fleet of six Britannias.[14], 13596=Monarch began commercial airline operations on 5 April 1968 with a charter flight from Luton to Madrid using a former Caledonian Airways Bristol 175 Britannia 300 turboprop.[8][11][12] The airline's initial fleet comprised two Bristol Britannias (both ex-Caledonian Airways).[8], 17722=In 1972, the airline carried 500,000 passengers in one year for the first time.[14], 45465=After many years of operating profitably, Monarch Group, the parent company of Monarch Airlines and Cosmos Holidays, reported a large pre-tax loss of Ã‚Â£32.3m in the financial year ending in 2009. This necessitated a Ã‚Â£45m cash injection from the Mantegazzas who have [co-]owned the group since its inception. The Mantegazza's cash injection was accompanied by a change in strategy that saw Monarch Airlines changing its focus from being primarily a charter airline to becoming a predominantly ""scheduled leisure airline"", with a target of 80% of its business being scheduled (compared with only 20% in 2005). The new strategy has already resulted in introduction of additional scheduled services to new destinations in Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Spain and Portugal, including the launch on 23 May 2011 of a three times weekly scheduled service to the Greek island of Corfu Ã¢Â€Â” the airline's first scheduled Greek destination Ã¢Â€Â“ from London Luton. France and Italy are expected to join Monarch's scheduled network in 2012.[53][54][55][56], 22114=At the end of 1980, Monarch Airlines took delivery of its first new jet aircraft, a pair of Boeing 737-200 Advanced, which had been acquired on an operating lease from Bavaria Leasing (at the time a unit of Hapag Lloyd Airlines).[24][25] One of the newly delivered 737s was stationed at Tegel Airport in then West Berlin (in the days before the German reunification) at the beginning of the 1981 summer season.[25] The Berlin-based aircraft operated short to medium-haul charter flights to the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands under contract to Flug-Union Berlin, at the time one of West Berlin's leading package tour operators. Monarch had taken over Flug-Union Berlin's charter programme from Laker Airways.[26] The addition of the 737s expanded Monarch's fleet to 11 jet aircraft, comprising one Boeing 707-320C, five Boeing 720Bs, three BAC One-Eleven 500s and two Boeing 737-200 Advs.[24], 16818=Monarch entered the jet age in 1971 when three Boeing 720Bs joined its fleet.[15][16][17] The airline's first commercial jet service took to the air on 13 December 1971.[14] The introduction of the company's first jet aircraft type also coincided with the adoption of a revised livery., 59557=On 24 October 2014 Monarch Holdings was acquired by private investment company and turnaround specialist Greybull Capital for a nominal sum just hours before MonarchÃ¢Â€Â™s licence with the Civil Aviation Authority expired. Greybull will own 90% of the airline, with the remaining 10% held by the groupÃ¢Â€Â™s pension fund[68] and provide access to Ã‚Â£125m of new capital. The strategic review which led to the deal will see Monarch downsize its fleet from 42 to 34 aircraft, renegotiate leases on 10 aircraft and cease long-haul and charter operations from April 2015, converting to a low cost model focusing on short-haul leisure routes. However, the new finance should secure the order for 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft signed up to at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show.[66], 63893=The Monarch fleet consists of the following aircraft as of May 2015:[70], 41920=On 27 April 2007, Monarch Airlines started flights to Ibiza partnered with club brand HedKandi, naming the partnership ""FlyKandi"". One of Monarch's Boeing 757s (G-MOND) received a special FlyKandi livery with billboard FlyKandi titles and a special tail motif.

UML n'ÃƒÂ©tant pas une mÃƒÂ©thode, leur utilisation est laissÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  l'apprÃƒÂ©ciation de chacun, mÃƒÂªme si le diagramme de classes est gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralement considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© comme l'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©ment central d'UMLÃ‚Â ; des mÃƒÂ©thodologies, telles que l'UnifiedProcess, axent l'analyse en tout premier lieu sur les diagrammes de cas d'utilisation (Use Case). De mÃƒÂªme, on peut se contenter de modÃƒÂ©liser seulement partiellement un systÃƒÂ¨me, par exemple certaines parties critiques. UML se dÃƒÂ©compose en plusieurs sous-ensemblesÃ‚Â : Les vuesÃ‚Â : Les vues sont les observables du systÃƒÂ¨me. Elles dÃƒÂ©crivent le systÃƒÂ¨me d'un point de vue donnÃƒÂ©, qui peut ÃƒÂªtre organisationnel, dynamique, temporel, architectural, gÃƒÂ©ographique, logique, etc. En combinant toutes ces vues, il est possible de dÃƒÂ©finir (ou retrouver) le systÃƒÂ¨me complet. Les diagrammesÃ‚Â : Les diagrammes sont des ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©ments graphiques. Ceux-ci dÃƒÂ©crivent le contenu des vues, qui sont des notions abstraites. Les diagrammes peuvent faire partie de plusieurs vues. Les modÃƒÂ¨les d'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©mentÃ‚Â : Les modÃƒÂ¨les d'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©ment sont les briques des diagrammes UML, ces modÃƒÂ¨les sont utilisÃƒÂ©s dans plusieurs types de diagrammes. Exemple d'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©mentÃ‚Â : cas d'utilisation (CU ou cadut'), classe, association, etc. Mise en Ã…Â“uvre d'une dÃƒÂ©marche ÃƒÂ  l'aide d'UMLÃ‚Â : les vues[modifier",False,-1,0,"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 21:05:26 GMT",

Indeed, their status is remarkably similar to that of the Monkees and it's not a coincidence that both groups' music was intended to appeal to younger teenagers. The difference is that as early as 1976, the Monkees began to be considered cool by people who really knew music; it has taken 35 years for Herman's Hermits to begin receiving higher regard for their work.

Actually, the fact that Boss has pieces of music that could comfortably be called ""songs"" might be the most radical thing about it. With the help of Lee Ranaldo as producer and occasional guitarist and glockenspiel player Ã¢Â€Â” and without former bassist Leah Quimby Ã¢Â€Â” on Boss the Markers strip away the most abrasive parts of their previous work, add just the right amount of melodies and structure, and somehow maintain the free-flowing, experimental heart of their music. It's not much of a stretch to say that the results are something of a revelation. Even the Magik Markers' biggest fans probably couldn't have predicted that the band would have been able to put their own spin on a more accessible sound and make such a drastic change sound so effortless, or that the husky twang of Elisa Ambrogio's singing on tracks like ""Axis Mundi"" would be just as compelling as the fearsome style she used before.

Two years later Cass and her three band mates made a demo tape of their musical interpretations of Morrison's poems, but the single reel-to-reel tape languished unheard for years until it ended up being bought by Courtney Love for her husband Kurt's birthday. After his death, the tape was acquired by Dylan Carlson who recognized it for the priceless historic artifact that it truly was. Unable to interest the other musicians in the band Earth, Carlson gave the tape to some Seattle friends who had a (then unknown) band called Rose Windows and the rest is history. OK, that's not what really happened, but after listening to ""Then Sun Dogs"" for the first time I felt like it needed an alternate history.

There's no need for an autopsy here to pick apart Rose Windows' influences; this music is still very much alive, as a song like the seven-minute ""Walkin' with a Woman"" makes abundantly clear through its various passages, led by bewitching vocalist Rabia Shaheen Qazi and cemented by the overall conceptual vision of Chris Cheveyo, the project's alleged leader. The songs may be mostly credited to Cheveyo, but this is a full-band effort in terms of execution. Qazi brings a mystical element even when the tunes turn pop-like (""Wartime Lovers""), while flautist Veronica Dye gives authenticity to the band's gentler songs.

Born Christopher Geppert in San Antonio, TX on May 3, 1951, Cross first surfaced in the Austin-based cover band Flash before signing a solo contract with Warner Bros. in the autumn of 1978. His self-titled debut LP appeared two years later, with the lead single ""Ride Like the Wind"" rocketing to the number two spot; the massive success of the second single, ""Sailing,"" made Cross a superstar, and in the wake of two more Top 20 hits, ""Never Be the Same"" and ""Say You'll Be Mine,"" he walked off with a record-setting five Grammys in 1981, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for ""Sailing."" He soon scored a second number one as well as an Academy Award with ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do),"" which he co-wrote with Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, and Peter Allen for the smash Dudley Moore film comedy Arthur., 22002=Cross' much-anticipated sophomore effort, Another Page, arrived in 1983, but except for the Top Ten entry ""Think of Laura"" (popularized through its constant presence on the daytime soap phenomenon General Hospital), the album failed to repeat the success of its predecessor, and somewhat amazingly, he never returned to the Top 40 again. Every Turn of the World appeared to little notice in 1985, and when 1988's Back of My Mind failed to chart altogether, Cross was dropped by Warner. His next album, Rendezvous, did not appear until five years later on BMG. Window followed in 1995, and in 1998 he signed to CMC International for Walking in Avalon, a two-disc effort split between new studio material and live recordings of his past hits. Cross returned in the spring of 2000 with The Red Room. Two years later, Rhino released the comprehensive hit collection The Very Best of Christopher Cross. Cross closed out the decade with a Christmas album in 2007 and an acoustic album called The Cafe Carlyle Sessions in 2008. Dr. Faith, his first collection of new songs in ten years, appeared in the fall of 2010.}"

Florian Marino takes the lead in the title chase, ahead of Michael Van Der Mark, Kev Coghlan and Jules Cluzel. Title favourite Kenan Sofuoglu is back in seventh.

Van Der Mark, earning the Magic Michael he has written on his leathers, would not slow down, maintaining his demoralising pace right to the flag where he became only the third active Supersport rider to win a race, throwing his hat firmly into the championship ring.

Kenan Sofuoglu, however, was closing on Florian Marino's second place and was showing the sort of pace that kept his hopes alive. And claw through he did.

Instructors are extremely approachable and can be a lot of fun in class. Classes don't seem to be too rigorous and as long as you pay attention in class and have a little bit of study time each week you should be able to breeze right through it assuming you aren't taking something like organic chemistry. You will have good instructors that know the material and offer help if needed and make it fun in some of your classes. Bang for the buck This college is extremely wallet friendly especially in comparison to the universities. If you don't think that this is a fair price then look at ASU or UofA and see what you think after that. This college is a great way to get a lot of your courses out of the way and is a great transition from high school to a university.,True,0,0,,

In the student Union there's also a little game/lounge room. Looks cool, but I've never been inside because it's always packed when I have a break."", ""There is a student Union near the front of the campus. The food is a little expensive for a college student on a budget, but there are some things that are lower in price. For example, if you only get a sandwich and not the combo you can save at least two bucks. The Student Union is very roomy and clean, can be loud at times when it's full of students, so it's not a good place to study and eat. There's a cafe inside the Student Union. The students who work in there are very nice and make your order quickly. Although again, the prices are very high for a starving student. However, I will say the coffee is delicious. It looks like they make up different flavors every week. There's also a Starbucks cafe in the semi-new Science building. It's very nice and clean. The students or non-students working back there are very nice as well and extremely helpful. Once I needed gloves for a science lab and they gave me enough for my whole class! The coffee is good of course, it's Starbucks, and the price is the same as any other Starbucks, too much for a student."", ""I don't think Glendale has dorms, but there are apartments across the street for student living and they are not the best looking apartments. I heard they are cheap, I've never looking into living there but of how they look (kind of dirty). Although, the apartments are in a very convenient place and it would take less than 5 minutes to get to the campus by walking across the street."", ""Some classes are easy, some are hard. This isn't High School, but it's not a University, however, students should still expect to work hard for their grades. Students should be sure to check on how the professor teaches. Ask other students or search online for ratings to see if the professor is helpful and actually cares about the students. That's all you can really do to insure good grades, but still be prepared to study hard."", ""Take college seriously! Even though you may think this is just a community college because they sometimes have a bad reputation, it's still an amazing educational institute. The time you spend here learning and earning grades will dictate your future at a University or other college you plan to attend. Do not take unnecessary classes. Talk with advisers at the college and at Universities to insure you are taking the correct classes. Don't procrastinate with this because you will spend lots of money on the wrong classes and waste your time on subjects you don't need. Make time for studying and join study groups because they really do help. If you take early morning classes prepare for traffic in the parking lot. Some times I had to park my car in the park behind the school because there were no spaces open."", ""Glendale Community College is a great school for students who aren't sure what they want to major in or don't have enough money to go to a University yet.

For example, in GCC I use to attend Phi Theta Kappa with some other engineering students; they didn't organize that particular group very well, but it wasn't completely unproductive, either... they planned a trip to different college campuses (authorized, of course) for different students to decide easier where they want to go."", ""For anyone who desires a smaller environment with a relaxing atmosphere, smaller groups of people, friendly teachers / counselors, and not in a rush for a busy and crazy time in a university, GCC is a nice place to start for college experiences. You can still meet intelligent people who have a desire to achieve their goals and take the work seriously while still enjoying each others' company."", 'There are times when they have various events in regards to celebrating or showing off traditions for different countries. They bring a piece of culturally diverse people, foods and displays during these events that allow us American college students what it is like in other places for other people. It can be pretty neat when these events occur so randomly throughout the semester.', ""Although the food pricing is completely ridiculous to me when it comes to purchasing meals at the campus, I would say that I get a bang for my buck for the most part when considering the experiences I've had through my teachers and other students working with me. I gained plenty of wonderful and yet crazy memories with the other classmates every time we had group projects to complete, and I wouldn't have had them at any other place."", ""They have quite a few events going on almost every week and definitely every month; sometimes me and some other college mates would walk around and see what is going on near the Student Union section of the Campus to witness the event's activities and see what they are selling or putting on display."", 'Inside the campus they have some fairly nice quality in warm foods and snacks, but the prices are outrageous.

If you try to attend a university before a community college, you will either be overwhelmed with the teachers, commotion or the possibly large debt. Also, GCC specifically has many friendly teachers and counselors that help you through the classwork and advising towards your desired job degree.', 'This school could definitely fit room in for improvement mainly because the pricing for certain foods or objects could be lowered. However, this is a fairly quaint and simple college place for us students who are intelligent enough to finish our prerequisites at a community college rather than a university.

As long as you study, be attentive, and do your homework it will not be difficult to keep! Bang for the buck Glendale Community College is extremely affordable. They offer academic scholarships through high school placement, placement testing, and an honors program. Saving money is critically important, and going through community college either to achieve an associates degree or transfer to a university is the way to go! Glendale Community College is the school everyone should consider around the Maricopa County. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere overall is positive and pleasant.

Unfortunately, the hoops you generally end up having to jump through in order to get enrolled (especially if you are a non-traditional student with unusual circumstances) really lower the value."", ""There are some pretty neat extracurriculars, but most of the fun come from certain classes. The Firearms course is great once you get past the lecture, there are a lot of great exercise courses that are also fun, etc. Unfortunately, outside of school, there isn't much fun to be had in AZ. You have to make your own fun."", ""It's cafeteria food. Which is pretty much cafeteria food wherever you go."", 'No dorms here.', ""Some classes would get five stars, others just get one. It's got a lot of basic courses that don't require too much work and brainpower, but it also has classes where if you're not on your A game you're going to fail."", ""Do your own research for what you need to graduate. Make sure you ALWAYS ask for a manager when speaking to someone in financial aid unless you're just turning in paperwork.

The air pump gets hot if left on for long periods. It is not quite hot enough to cause a problem, but it will last longer if it is not always on, and turning it off will keep dust from accumulating inside the laser unnecessarily. You don't need to watch the laser every single second, but you should at least stay in the little room while it's on and keep a general eye on it. Why? Because if","Tips Before putting your material into the laser cutter, test your image on paper. If you don't test on paper first you will ruin a lot of the material you are cutting. Once it looks good on paper you can place your material on the paper so you know it is positioned properly, and refocus if the material is thick. When engraving raster images, they go much faster if you use a lower DPI. The lowest setting is 250 DPI and that is enough for most things. Use higher DPI only with high resolution images and with materials that show the difference.
