The delegation only encompasses sources subject to one or more Federal section 112 standards (Part 63 standards specifically) which are also subject to the requirements of the Title V operating permits program. The delegation of authority under this action does not include authorities contained in CAA section 112(r)., 16915=On February 24, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule approving the updated delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources) to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 94551=On January 30, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines and the Standards of Performance for Stationary Internal Combustion Engines. Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. On September 5, 2013, the EPA announced reconsideration of and requested public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration. A summary of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice of reconsideration and the EPA's responses to those comments (Response to Comment document) can be found in the rulemaking docket at Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0708. After careful consideration of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice, the EPA has determined that it will not propose any changes to the regulations at this time related to the three petition issues, and is providing notice of this decision. The EPA is informing the petitioners of the decision in separate letters to the petitioners. The letters explain the EPA's reasons for not proposing changes to the regulations for those three issues. Further discussion of the three petition issues can be found in the Response to Comment document., 197291=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the receipt of a complete petition requesting that the EPA add the chemical n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) (Chemical Abstract Service No. 106-94-5) to the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) contained in section 112(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). On October 28, 2010 and November 28, 2012, the Halogenated Solvent Industry Alliance (HSIA) submitted a petition to list nPB as a HAP and a supplement to the petition, respectively. In addition, on November 24, 2011, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitted a petition to add nPB to the HAP list. We have determined that these petitions are complete for purposes of this process, which means they provide sufficient information to assess the human health impacts on people living in the vicinity of facilities emitting nPB. Today's document initiates our comprehensive technical review phase of the petition process. The EPA invites the public to comment on these petitions and to provide additional data, beyond what are in these petitions, on sources, emissions, exposure, health effects and environmental impacts associated with nPB that may be relevant to our technical review. These petitions and supporting information are available through Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0471. Following completion of the technical review phase that is initiated by today's notice and runs through the EPA's evaluation of all the comments received, the EPA will decide whether to grant or deny the petitions., 229324=On January 31, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers and process heaters at major sources of HAP. Subsequently, the EPA received 10 petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. The EPA is seeking comment only on these three issues. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule. Additionally, the EPA is proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule to clarify definitions, references, applicability and compliance issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 267172=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the November 13, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNESHAP Risk and Technology Review for the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries; NESHAP for Wool Fiberglass Area SourcesÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 30 days., 335848=This action corrects our supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on October 6, 2014. In that action, there is an incorrect location for the public hearing. This document amends the public hearing location and the date the hearing will be held, if requested.}","Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:30:57 GMT"

This is a renewable fuel, lowering fossil carbon dioxide up to 80 %. Petrol and bioethanol can be mixed in the fuel tank. Ã‚Â  A DRIVe (Volvo's environmental concept) version of the Volvo V70 is available since spring 2009 as well, combining large-car qualities with low fuel consumption. The driveline includes a 1.6 litre diesel engine and a manual gearbox.Ã‚Â  The engine falls into Volvo's 120g category (out of three different categories: 120g, 140g and 160g depending on the car's size and other things). The 1.6D DRIVe delivers 109 horsepower and 240 Nm. Fuel consumption is 4.5 l/100 km and CO2 emissions are 119g, 21% lower than the 2.0-litre diesel engine. There are other unique features that characterise the Volvo V70 DRIVe model, such as a covered grille and a lowered chassis (20 mm at front and 15 mm in the rear). In addition, it has special tyres with low rolling resistance and an optimised electronic power steering.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  The new 2.4D engine is a medium-performance engine based on the same technology as the D5. It is a single-turbo version, providing even lower fuel consumption. Preliminary fuel consumption figures are 6.0 l/100 km and 159 g/km (CO2 emissions). With an automatic gearbox, the figures are 6.8 l/km and 179 g/km.
