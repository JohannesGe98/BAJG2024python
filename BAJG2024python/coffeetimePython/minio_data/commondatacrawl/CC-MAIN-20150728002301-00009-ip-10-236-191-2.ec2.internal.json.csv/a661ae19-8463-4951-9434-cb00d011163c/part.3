Living in the village means you have every time of store to see as well as access to every part of Manhattan. Stay in the village and enjoy Washington Square Park, or go to SoHo and go on a shopping spree. Maybe you want to go to lower Manhattan and see the Freedom tower, Wall Street, and the amazing architecture or maybe you want to go to Central Park and take in the beauty. That's just the tip of the iceberg, the sheer amount of fun to be had is inexplicable.

However, NYU's dining halls come pretty close to home food as well as other restaurant style food. Dining halls like Rubin, Downstein, and Hayden have the best variety of home-cooked style food while dining halls like Kimmel have amazing Chinese, Mexican, and Italian food; UHall has the most amazing burgers; and Palladium has great multi-cultural food. I have had friends from other colleges visit and yell out their jealousy for our food. My meal plan covers 14 meals a week and I use them all without hesitation. NYU has amazing food, if anyone says anything otherwise they don't go here!"", ""Dorm life, as anyone can imagine, is not uniform across the board. Any and every college's dorm life is random and influenced by chance. Personally, dorm life has been amazing in every aspect. The people in my dorm, not to mention my floor, are amazing. Everyone tries to be your friend during the first few weeks so being friendly is a great way to make friends fast. My floor is incredibly close, we hang out all the time, get our meals together, work out together, and go out into the city. I couldn't ask for better friends and hallmates. If there's one piece of advice I can give you it is buy a doorstop! Keep your door open!"", ""The academic rigor is nothing short of what has come to be associated with NYU. Everything of course depends on the track you choose, easiness is subjective and particular to each student however, you really can't hope to pull off a 4.0 by just coasting. Take the time to do your assignments and study, nothing is more gratifying than doing well in class at such a great school like NYU. A balanced student is a successful one. Do your work and you'll have all the time in the world to do the millions of activities there are to do in the greatest city in the world."", 'Prospective students, please have an open mind when coming to NYU. I have met people from every corner of the country as well as a huge variety of countries around the world. The social life is probably one of the most entertaining aspects of being at NYU. Sometimes there is so much to do we just dont know what to choose but the most important part is finding the time for socializing and homework. Procrastination is so easy, and no one is around to keep you on track. It takes a responsible student to do well at NYU.', ""New York University is the best combination of the college experience and the urban life. You have your classes and all of Manhattan on your doorstep which makes for one of the most unique lifestyles I've ever come to know. I get the education of one the most prestigious schools in the world as well as a wonderful segue to adult life as a New Yorker.""]]",New York University (NYU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/New-York-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/78941,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,139,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00009-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,894831107,894634903,HORIZONTAL,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 163 out of 167 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 of 220 Gabriella from Virginia Beach, VA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For those who do not find that fact daunting, NYU will probably be a great place for you. However, even if you are more reserved, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people (orientation, extra-curricular activities, residence halls, classes) and there truly is a niche for everyone. As long as you are open to new relationships (friends, professors, etc.), perspectives, and environments, you will most likely thrive at NYU. Living in one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s greatest cities is not without its temptations, so make sure you can keep a realistic balance between the social and academic aspects of college.

The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall. The sticker shock, while intimidating, can be managed through a combination of loans, frugal spending, and financial aid. All of which can easily half the total figure.

The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall. The sticker shock, while intimidating, can be managed through a combination of loans, frugal spending, and financial aid. All of which can easily half the total figure.

Going to school in the Big City is not an easy thing, but if you get through it you come out with a strong work ethic and with strong determination. When I first left NYU I worked retail at Staples. But the strong core values that NYU provided, I easily grew to Management. While a manager at Staples I made sure I went to every conference, read every article and met as many vendors as I could regarding office supplies. I eventually left Staples to open my own office supply store in Long Island. We had some success and some failures, but it wasn't till my 13th year of out of school when things started to really kick into gear for me. I saw the success of the interent and decided to take my brick and mortar store and turn it completely virtual. www.BulkOfficeSupply.com was born. making over 500,000 a month, with no store overhead or even warehouse charges.

Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall.

For those who do not find that fact daunting, NYU will probably be a great place for you. However, even if you are more reserved, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people (orientation, extra-curricular activities, residence halls, classes) and there truly is a niche for everyone. As long as you are open to new relationships (friends, professors, etc.), perspectives, and environments, you will most likely thrive at NYU. Living in one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s greatest cities is not without its temptations, so make sure you can keep a realistic balance between the social and academic aspects of college. NYU is perfect for those who want an exciting/non-traditional college experience, who donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind being obstructed from class because Robert Pattinson is filming, who love bustling cities and cultural experiences, who are open-minded and independent, who want to carve out their own opportunities, who revel in the fact that NYUÃ¢Â€Â™s football team is undefeated and the mascot is a violet/the library card catalog, who want to explore, grow, and challenge themselves, in addition to those who are looking to have the time of their lives.

The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall. The sticker shock, while intimidating, can be managed through a combination of loans, frugal spending, and financial aid. All of which can easily half the total figure.

The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall. The sticker shock, while intimidating, can be managed through a combination of loans, frugal spending, and financial aid. All of which can easily half the total figure.

Carpe diem, baby Ã¢Â€Â“ just follow your passions. If the college application process has finished (congratulations, hope it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t drive you too mad), then it must be decision time. This may seem obvious, but if you do not like the city, NYU is probably not for you. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve met several first-years who chose NYU despite their dislike for the city, and then ended up hating their entire experience. You have to understand that the closest thing to a quad you will get is Washington Square Park: a former burial ground. Take the time to visit NYU, make sure you can see yourself living there for four years. Talk to current students, stay overnight, sit in on a class, talk to faculty, do your research, get all of your questions answered. Every school within NYU has its own specialization/field.

For those who do not find that fact daunting, NYU will probably be a great place for you. However, even if you are more reserved, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people (orientation, extra-curricular activities, residence halls, classes) and there truly is a niche for everyone.

Living in one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s greatest cities is not without its temptations, so make sure you can keep a realistic balance between the social and academic aspects of college. NYU is perfect for those who want an exciting/non-traditional college experience, who donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind being obstructed from class because Robert Pattinson is filming, who love bustling cities and cultural experiences, who are open-minded and independent, who want to carve out their own opportunities, who revel in the fact that NYUÃ¢Â€Â™s football team is undefeated and the mascot is a violet/the library card catalog, who want to explore, grow, and challenge themselves, in addition to those who are looking to have the time of their lives.

There is no one kind of NYU student, although some may say the stereotype is the artsy fartsy kids, but thats only 80% true.

That is the one thing every NYU student needs.', ""NYU IS EXPENSIVE. The tuition's expensive, the room & board are expensive, the cost of living is basically astronomical, but is it worth it! The answer for me is unequivocally YES. If you are passionate about what your learning, there is no other place to be, every day I'm learning and growing and my possibilities are endless. Do I wish tuition was less? Yes. Do I wish financial aid was better? YES YES YES YES YES x infinity! But would I rather be somewhere else? Absolutely not."", ""Everything you could possibly imagine is at your fingertips! Don't get stuck in Washington Square, hop on the Subway and explore the entire map. Go see a play on broadway, visit the Met on the Upper East side, go to Smorgasburg in Brooklyn, and check out the amazing galleries and the Highline in Chelsea. There is always something to do whether its 1 PM or 1 AM or any time in between.

There is always a variety of options that change every night, so you'll never get bored and don't even get me started on Palladium Brunch (an all you can eat gourmet brunch every Sunday. COST: 1 meal swipe) The staff are always kind and the food is great, especially with New York city prices. However, if you are able to, don't limit yourself to a dining hall, try to get out and experience the dining around NYU, NYC is the best place for food in the world, don't miss it, get out there and try everything that you possibly can!"", ""For the most part the dorms are beautiful, especially if you're lucky enough to have a room with an AMAZING view of the city. My room has one, but sadly it is one of the smaller ones (it really should be a single), but that's part of living in NYC, sometimes you'll be lucky and get a huge room and other times you'll get a closet, but you just have to make the best out of it. There's always people around and activities constantly happening and being planned, so you'll always have something to do. I wonder if any other Residence Halls play Chopped, Project Runway with Office Supplies, or weekly American Horror Story viewing parties with complimentary snacks! The only real drawback is who you land with for roommates, are they pigs or neat freaks or somewhere in between, but i suppose its the same at any college. NYU dorms are nice and there's always something fun to do, but really I only use my dorm as a place to sleep, I like to get out there and experience NYC!"", ""Classes are tough, but only because the professor knows what they can get out of you. As an acting major in Tisch, my work load and academic rigor is a bit different than other students in CAS, Stern, or Steinhardt, but my classes still push me to my limits, and sometimes even push me past breaking, but I still give it my all.

Don't judge before you try, just keep an open mind, and you can do anything here. Two. Never say no! Never ever! Try every new food, go to every play, museum, gallery, or whatever you are offered!

Carpe diem, baby Ã¢Â€Â“ just follow your passions. If the college application process has finished (congratulations, hope it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t drive you too mad), then it must be decision time. This may seem obvious, but if you do not like the city, NYU is probably not for you. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve met several first-years who chose NYU despite their dislike for the city, and then ended up hating their entire experience. You have to understand that the closest thing to a quad you will get is Washington Square Park: a former burial ground. Take the time to visit NYU, make sure you can see yourself living there for four years. Talk to current students, stay overnight, sit in on a class, talk to faculty, do your research, get all of your questions answered. Every school within NYU has its own specialization/field.

For those who do not find that fact daunting, NYU will probably be a great place for you. However, even if you are more reserved, there are plenty of opportunities to meet people (orientation, extra-curricular activities, residence halls, classes) and there truly is a niche for everyone. As long as you are open to new relationships (friends, professors, etc.), perspectives, and environments, you will most likely thrive at NYU. Living in one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s greatest cities is not without its temptations, so make sure you can keep a realistic balance between the social and academic aspects of college. NYU is perfect for those who want an exciting/non-traditional college experience, who donÃ¢Â€Â™t mind being obstructed from class because",True,0,0,,"{346005=Don't discount it. Seriously. I wasn't very enthusiastic before I came to NYU, even though I had accepted a few months ago. I wasn't even enthusiastic in August, the few weeks before I came to New York. I was terrified and starting to wonder if I'd made the right decision for me. That all changed the first week. I made friends, I met super interesting and creative people, I explored the city, and I was energized. There's nothing like being in New York City with amazing people in your college years. You have the whole world ahead of you, and the city isn't as scary as it seems (coming from someone whose hometown has 8000 people)., 1031362=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13972=Academically speaking, New York University is somewhat of a hodgepodge in quality between its different schools, so make sure you apply to the right one with the right credentials. Among its more renowned branches include: The Tisch School of the Arts: Founded and supported by the late Laurence Tisch (who, by the way, graduated from what is now Stern) and his family, the Tisch School is known as the #1 film school in the U.S. That said, If you're applying here, make sure you've got artistic chops. You will need a strong portfolio that should blow people away with its creativity and uniqueness, and know that you are competing against the best amateur film makers and artists around the globe. On the bright side, standardized scores and figures aren't emphasized, so a low GPA and SAT aren't that hazardous. Known graduates include Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, and even Angelina Jolie. Left-handedness is preferred. The Stern School of Business: Known for producing investment bankers that go on to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc, the Stern school is filled with people with great mathematical skills with good GPA's and high SAT scores. Aim for a > 3.6 GPA, > 2100 SAT and > 720 on SAT II's. Known graduates include: John Paulson, Robert Soros, Alan Greenspan. NYU's College of Arts & Sciences is a bit trickier than the other two schools, but its strong points include the Courant Department of Mathematics (#1 in applied math, USNWR), Philosophy and Economics. You can study anything here and the requirements are significantly lower than the previously mentioned schools. Aim for >3.4 GPA, >1900 SAT, >650 SAT II's. Gallatin is the school where you can create your own major. You have access to every course at NYU, so you can mix and match things around and end up as a specialist in Indian Agriculture. While the atmosphere here is extremely liberal, I would advise against applying to this school unless you are very independent. Keep in mind, if you wanted to major in Finance or a something in NYU's specialized schools (Tisch & Stern), you would have to do an internal transfer. Requirements are about the same as CAS Polytechnic is the new engineering branch for NYU. Since the school has just been incorporated in to the system, I expect that its requirements would be a little lower than CAS. There you go, a whirlwind tour of NYU's departments. Good luck on your application., 778748=I believe theres about 1000 clubs to choose from, you'll find something!, 244778=Not an unusual tradition, but the 2011 welcome week dance was Lady Gaga themed - called the Monster Ball. People went all out for this dance - some friends and I actually made our dresses out of duct tape!, 754581=Types of students that don't want the typical college experience of going to sports games and everyone in NYU attire. it's great for hipsters, people who march to their own drum, girls who are independent and like to dress up for class, and definitely international students., 538159=During May, there is what is called NYU Strawberry Festival. Basically, it is a celebration of springtime. Many free things are handed out, there is music, and you can see the very long strawberry cake that they have for you taste., 342810=It varies from hall to hall. Weinstein has the only Chick-Fil-A in the city (as of 2014 anyway). There's also a Subway and Jamba Juice in Weinstein. There's also an on-campus Starbucks that accepts Dining Dollars (a component of the NYU meal plan that all freshmen are required to sign up for). Palladium has an awesome all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain, a bagel bar (bagels, smoked salmon, a few types of cream cheese, and scallions), fruit bowls, omelettes, and of course, cereal, eggs, and tater tots. Third North is supposed to be the worst dining hall, but I think we have it pretty good here if people say that. I always see a lot of people at Third North, and I personally like it. The pizza is the best of NYU (in my opinion), and their breakfast wraps are amazing. They also have incredibly addicting chocolate chip cookies. I swear, you can't stop at one. You have to have at least two cookies., 337289=There's a public safety bus that will take you from any NYU location to another from 12:00-7:00AM (I think those are the hours, I forget when the morning ones end). It's also very safe around campus though. There are scattered police on the streets. There are also other students. In general, Greenwich Village (where NYU is located) is a nice area of NYC. Just don't be stupid and you'll be fine. I usually walk back from the library with friends anyway because I don't like walking alone., 705191=Depends on how much tuition is for you, but the teachers here will make it worth your while. The only slight negative effect is that NYU has plans to expand their campus by 2031, and there's a lot of money being diverted to renovations and other things, all which take away from the scholarships that NYU offers. Look for other scholarships at Cappex!}",

The magic word '!' provides a way to allow ""|"" in a parameter value of a template or parser function, in particular for use in table syntax. This template can be used with ExpandTemplates to perform partial expansion/substitution. In addition there is a preview area. However, this shows the rendered result of expanding the expanded wikitext again (bugzilla:28616).

This affects the result of parser functions: a comment in the expression of #expr or #ifexpr gives an error message unless ""Remove comments"" is on, and comments affect #if and ifeq.

Using mipmapping means selecting between multiple mipmaps based on the angle and size of the texture relative to the screen. Whether you use mipmapping or not, you can still select between linear blending of the particular layer or nearest. And if you do use mipmapping, you can choose to either select a single mipmap to sample from, or you can sample the two adjacent mipmaps and linearly blend the resulting values to get the final result. The minification filter is controlled by the GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER texture parameter. To understand these values better, it is important to discuss what the particular options are. The magnification filter is controlled by the GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER texture parameter. This value can be GL_LINEAR or GL_NEAREST. If GL_NEAREST is used, then the implementation will select the texel nearest the texture coordinate; this is commonly called ""point sampling""). If GL_LINEAR is used, the implementation will perform a weighted linear blend between the nearest adjacent samples. Filtering is the process of accessing a particular sample from a texture. There are two cases for filtering: minification and magnification. Magnification means that the area of the fragment in texture space is smaller than a texel, and minification means that the area of the fragment in texture space is larger than a texel. Filtering for these two cases can be set independently. Filtering Locations in a","A note on terminology. This discussion has refrained from using the common filtering terms ""bilinear"" and ""trilinear."" This is for a good reason; these terms are often misunderstood and do not carry over to all texture types. Take the term ""bilinear"". This term is used because it refers to linear filtering in 2 axes: horizontally and vertically in a 2D texture. A monolinear would be filtering in one axis, and thus trilinear is filtering in 3 axes. The problem is that what constitutes ""bilinear"" depends on the texture type. Or specifically, its dimensionality. Setting GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER and MIN_FILTERs to GL_LINEAR will create monolinear filtering in a 1D texture, bilinear filtering in a 2D texture, and trilinear in a 3D texture. In all cases, it is simply doing a linear filter between the nearest samples; some texture types simply have more nearest samples than others. Unfortunately, what most people think of as ""trilinear"" is not linear filtering of a 3D texture, but what in OpenGL terms is GL_LINEAR mag filter and GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR in the min filter in a 2D texture. That is, it is bilinear filtering of each appropriate mipmap level, and doing a third linear filter between the adjacent mipmap levels. Hence the term ""trilinear"". This is easily confused with what is just GL_LINEAR for 3D textures. That is why OpenGL and this discussion does not use these terms.
