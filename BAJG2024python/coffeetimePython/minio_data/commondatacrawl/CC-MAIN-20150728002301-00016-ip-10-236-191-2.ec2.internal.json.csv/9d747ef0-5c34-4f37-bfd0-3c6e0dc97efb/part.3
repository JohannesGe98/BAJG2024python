They give out lots of scholarship money but the school is expensive anyway. Am enjoying being here The school isn't THAT small. There's always something to do there. It's a small community and you will get to know more people then if you were at a bigger college. Joining clubs will keep you busy as well if that's what you're looking for. Am learning a lot The fact that the class size is really small, gives the teacher more time to give out more information and pretty much call out each and every one of us to make sure we know whats going on. Sometimes you think you understand until you're asked; that's when you challenge yourself and find if you understand the material at hand. The subject doesn't matter. The professors there will learn your name and know your capacity pretty soon. If you need help. Help is everywhere! tutoring programs by subject are free.

But garment customisation cannot always be fully automated. Applying grading rules maintain the same details but sometimes achieves a different overall effect; but the customer expects the same overall effect and is less concerned about details. Choosing between alternative customisations requires a human designer's trained perceptual judgement. Therefore a viable mass customisation support system must support the repeated redesign of a garment by combining automatic design with fast human editing. Evaluating and modifying the suggestions of others is a natural and efficient activity for designers. This paper describes two prototype automatic design systems exploring techniques that could be used for mass customisation of knitted garments - in which the shape and patterns are indivisibly linked. An early pattern placing system that automatically altered both shape and pattern parameters in a variety of alternative ways. A shape design system that generates technically correct and consistent garment shapes from a set of measurements and a verbal description; it works independently of sizes, recalculating the shape for each new set of measurements. Starting from the system's suggestions, designers can very quickly tweak the new design to fulfil their aesthetic intentions."", 'EPSRC, ESRC Cognitive Engineering Initiative', 'en', 'Technical University of Munich', 'Working Paper Series of the Department for General and Industrial Management, TUM Business School, Technical University of Munich;', 'knitwear design', 'mass customization', 'redesign', 'Knitwear customisation as repeated redesign.', 'Conference', 'Yes'], ['', '', '', '', '', 'en', '', '', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en', '', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en']]",Knitwear customisation as repeated redesign.,,https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/3859?show=full,False,NONE,RELATION,0,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00016-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900426200,900417998,VERTICAL,,,Show simple item record View Usage Statistics Statistics Login My Account By Submission Date By Publication Date Research Group Subjects/Keywords Titles Authors This Collection By Submission Date By Publication Date Research Group Subjects/Keywords Titles Authors Communities & Collections All of DORA Browse JavaScript is disabled for your browser.
