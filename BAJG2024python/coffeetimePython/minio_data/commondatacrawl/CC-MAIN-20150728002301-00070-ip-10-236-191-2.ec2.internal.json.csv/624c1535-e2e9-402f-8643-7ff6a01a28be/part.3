"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""USU is ideal for students of limited financial means who wish to maximize opportunities to participate in undergraduate research, who want a moderately-sized campus of 15-20,000 students with moderately fancy facilities, and who want mostly LDS surroundings without most of BYU's quirkiness. That mostly means modest, clean, and courteous classmates. For all that, though, USU has a very diverse campus and offers an interesting international experience. USU is nationally ranked in elementary and special education, engineering, stringed instruments, and several other areas, so it's a good school to consider if you're interested in those things."", ""If the University of Utah or BYU accept you and give decent scholarships, go there. USU is a good school, but the U. of U. and BYU are better schools in general. If you go to USU, get off-campus housing. Get involved in clubs or research groups. USU has many clubs of all sorts, and they're a good diversion from study. Most professors on campus are more than willing to accept freshmen into their research groups, so you can gain hands-on experience with the scientific process from day one. The upperclassmen and graduate students in these groups are almost always very friendly, and may become your best friends. Go to concerts. The Kent Concert Hall and Caine-Wanlass Performance Hall have a busy schedule of fine music. It's a great way to spend Friday night. Take advantage of the library. It's possibly the best library you'll ever have access to. Learn every nook and cranny of it. Make friends. Don't be grumpy. And of course, work hard in your classes. Study, study, study, and find a job if you have time. There is no substitute for work and study."", ""If you√¢\x80\x99re going to move away from home to go to a Utah college and cost is a concern, USU is the place to go. Its tuition is lower than that of either Brigham Young University or the University of Utah, and it is more generous with scholarships than either. USU gives one year of half tuition for a 3.3 GPA and 28 ACT; the U. of U. only gives a semester of half tuition for the same, and BYU gives almost nothing to many applicants. USU has much lower tuition than many other schools of the same quality, and Logan's cost of living is also pretty low. However, if you're looking to save money, DO NOT LIVE ON CAMPUS. The on-campus housing costs as much as even the most expensive off-campus student apartments, even though the buildings are old and poorly maintained, and the on-campus housing contract is quite restrictive. Living in the dorms, with a meal plan, is nearly the most expensive housing available, in terms of total cost, and you're restricted to dining hall food and a small dorm room. Go to USU, but FIND OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING."", 'I live on the sixth floor of the on-campus dorms at USU. They are smelly and grungy. The elevators break down. The Wi-Fi is horrible. Quiet hours are routinely violated. The dining hall by the dorms is dirty and smelly, and the food is lukewarm and greasy. Needless to say, I don√¢\x80\x99t enjoy where I√¢\x80\x99m living. Campus is very flat and compact, so there√¢\x80\x99s never any difficulty in crossing campus in the ten minutes between classes. That can be pretty nice, especially when the weather√¢\x80\x99s bad. However, that also means that USU√¢\x80\x99s campus lacks the large, beautiful arboreal spaces several other campuses in Utah have, and it also lacks many of the other facilities, amenities, and on-campus diversions that other Utah colleges have. The Performing Arts Center and Kent Concert Hall maintain a full schedule, so there√¢\x80\x99s almost always a good concert for a Friday night. Logan Canyon is just east of campus, and has many interesting day hikes to go on with friends. From my perspective as a big-city kid, Logan (pop. 50,000) has little to recommend it. Downtown consists mostly of bookshops, bike shops, and restaurants, with a smattering of historic buildings here and there. Interesting as they might be, bookshops and old houses aren√¢\x80\x99t worth going downtown for every weekend. The student population at USU is very friendly, with a curious mix of outgoingness and shyness. 85% of the population is LDS, so there√¢\x80\x99s less skanky clothing and fewer piercings than on many other campuses. This also means the student body is pretty quiet. The police blotter doesn√¢\x80\x99t reel with accounts of binge drinkers and streakers, which is nice. As for sports: USU football loses. Football games are no fun if you go for the game. USU basketball wins. Basketball games are great fun. √¢\x80\x98Nuff said.', 'Utah State University touts a friendly atmosphere, intimate campus, world-class research faculty and ready opportunities to work with them, and accessible professors.

Students can gain a wonderful education while separated from their families as they learn the ins and outs of making their own life decisions.', ""I would suggest getting admitted early in the year if you are planning on attending fall semester as it takes a little time to get all of your paper work submitted. There is a lot of affordable student housing available near the campus but the waiting lists can be a little long for some places so do not delay your search for housing. Overall there are many opportunities to enjoy the student life on campus and in the surrounding community, don't be shy explore the valley and enjoy the local culture."", 'Tuition at USU is comparable to University of Utah and Brigham Young University, two other universities in the state. When compared to tuition costs in many other states USU tuition is substantially less. I believe the quality of education to be very good for the cost.', 'I have enjoyed my time at USU very much. There are plenty of on campus activities to attend as well local activities in Cache Valley. The campus grounds are well kept and it is fun to just walk around to see the flower gardens, these are most appreciated if you happen to have summer classes here. I also really like the Merrill Cazier library; it provides a very good environment to study and has a lot of resources. You can also request reading materials to be transferred to the library from a variety of outside sources, giving you amazing access to any research material you might need.', 'I have experienced a lot of personal and academic growth so far.

However, there are still very modern and up to date places closer to campus. Most of the activities that you can do around Logan and Utah State involve doing something outside. The mountains are right behind the campus. If you like doing things outside you'll really enjoy Utah State. Logan can get quite cold during the winter time so make sure that you bundle up."", ""Usually if you're thinking about going to college you're more than likely a senior in High School, so it would be pointless for me to tell you at this point to do your best in high school to get a good gpa or to get involved at your school. More than likely it's too late for that anyways. One thing that you do need to realize is that even though college is a very fun place to be, it's much different than high school. Professors here won't babysit you and make sure that you're getting the education that you need. They all have their own problems and lives to live too and could care less if you decide to try to learn something or not. My suggestion to you would be to learn to take responsibility of your life and get organized. Many professors will give you a schedule for the semester and won't tell you about upcoming assignments because they'll expect you to remember and to do it. That said, there are no late assignments accepted hardly ever. Of course if you can be sure to study hard for the ACT or respective SAT and get good grades in High School."", ""In state tuition at Utah State is incredible! It's very low compared to most other schools in the nation and the opportunities that you have once you get here are well worth that which you pay. Even if you are from out of state the tuition is obviously higher, but it's still a great rate. Plus you can always stay in Logan over the summer and apply for in state tuition for the next school year."", ""Because of the size of the campus and the way the local student housing is set up, Utah State is a very social environment. There are so many clubs and organizations on campus that it's impossible not to find something that you're not interested in and can't get involved it. The intro classes on campus aren't always that much fun, since they're all generals, but once you get past those they tend to get much more involved with what you want to study and some people even find that they enjoy school. Crazy huh?"", ""Utah State is a wonderful school with a good faculty that is dedicated to helping you succeed and graduate. Of course the professors aren't perfect and some of them are better at teaching than others, but it is comforting to know that they are all normal people and most are very understanding. I haven't had a professor yet that hasn't been willing to help me understand course material if I was willing to talk to them outside of class in their office. Many intro level classes also have review sessions, recitation courses, and TA's that are in existence just for you as students to make sure you succeed. Granted a lot of how much you learn is based upon how much you are willing to try and how much effort you're willing to put into your education. Professors here won't force you to learn. If you don't want to learn than you don't have to, but you will be missing out on some incredible experiences if you do.

time on homecoming night. however, if you are already a true aggie, and the love of your life isn't... you can make them a true aggie on the night of a full moon. the university gives out small calendars that you can stick to your fridge to remind you of when a true aggie night comes around. just this year utah state made it into the record books with the longest kissing chain. i'm not sure

much history and keeps that alive. however, i am a girl who is catholic, an only child, and comes from a single parent family. so i am probably considered the minority. most of the students who go to usu are members of the lds church. if you are coming from out of state, do a little research on the religion just to get a basic understanding of the culture you will be entering. just remember

college students. there is always something to do on campus, literally at any time of day and any day of the week. usu always has excellent guest speakers who come and talk for free and the university always hosts great parties for holidays. usu is a beautiful town and has many outdoor recreational activities that residents take advantage of. if you are a student you get a discount on ski or

you've taken, you can still pass with flying colors thanks to the professor. i can honestly say that i've had more professors in college that have changed the way i look at things and think than ever

And you do this on the night of a full moon by kissing someone while standing on top of the A in the middle of the quad on the campus.

It is easy to earn instate residency for the upcoming years.', 'There is so much to do in Logan. When it is warm outside it is great to go rock climbing or mountain biking and there is a place on campus to rent climbing gear, and a FREE bike rental place that is so awesome! In the winter Beaver mountain is so close for skiers and snowboarders.

I had such great roommates and neighbors. My Resident Assistant was always helping out all of the freshmen getting around campus and learning the best ways to do things, and definitely helped in getting more involved and excited about the school events.', 'It has been a lot more challenging that I expected, but in most of my classes there is an SI (Supplemental Instruction) leader that holds study sessions a couple times a week and it really helps to go because the SI teacher goes over what we have learned in class, and it is in smaller groups which makes it easier to learn.', 'Meet with your counselor, they are so helpful and really do want to see you succeed and graduate with the degree that you want.

Clean the sink at Angie's... Classic Logan for sure 2. Explore Main Street, there is always something new to find 3. $3 theater! They always have at least one good movie 4. Try a new restaurant! My roommates and I tried so many different types of food... Thai, Indian, and even simple things like Sonic 5. Ride down Old Main Hill, no matter how you do it, it's always fun. You can go skiing, sledding, slip and sliding... The options are really endless 6. Stay home and watch a movie! 7. Stay home and do a craft, play a game, meet your neighbors! 8. Do something on campus, there's always something going on 9. Football games, basketball games, and hockey games are to die for! 10. Roller blading, bowling, country swing dancing all at the Fun Park! 11. Bon Fire 12. Cliff jumping 13. Star observatory on campus 14. Play hide-and-seek in the giant library 15.

The Skyroom is like a diamond in the rough; not many people know about it, but I love it! They have soup, salad, rolls, and dessert all for $7, but for $10 you can get all of that plus a real buffet. It's on the top floor of the building, overlooking campus, with a piano player, and not very many people.

My dorm was co-ed and I actually liked it a lot more than I expected to; all of the people were respectful to the rules and guidelines. I know that isn't guaranteed everywhere, but I haven't really heard many building problems.

There are way to many clubs to count, but my favorite are ASUSU and the Country Swing Club.', 'There is something for everyone. There is never a dull moment in Logan.', 'The most well-know tradition is True Aggie Night. Every full moon, people gather around theA statue, and take their turn kissing upon it. They then get a True Aggie care that states the name of the person they kissed.', ""The great thing about Utah State, is that it rests within a college town. That means that there are a lot of fun activities and discounts for college students. Logan has a lot to offer. Some of my favorite activities include Country Swing Dancing every Monday and Wednesday night, Karaoke at Pizza Pie Cafe every Thursday night, 80's Roller Skating every Tuesday night, bowling, free concerts, dances, Institute parties, and plays."", 'Another reason why South Campus is a good choice, is because you have your own kitchen, and therefore, are not required to have a meal plan. I work at the Marketplace, where everyone goes for their meal plans. Yes, the food is pretty good, but you get tired of it after a while, and it is overall, cheaper, to make your own meals. If you choose to go with a meal plan, there are a lot of different dining options at Utah State. Places, such as the Quad Side Cafe, are great for a quick and delicious meal.', 'Living in the dorms is such a great opportunity, especially at Utah State. I would recommend anywhere in South Campus, because the location is unbeatable, the prices are the lowest on campus, and the community is amazing. In fact, my building (Reeder Hall) was voted best community in the West; that includes all universities west of the Mississippi. Everyone is very social, and you can always find something to do, or someone to hang out with. My best friends were made in the dorms. If you are an incoming freshman, not living in the dorms would be a mistake. My college experience has been tremendous, and I have dorm life to thank for that.', 'Utah State offers many great programs, many of which are highly ranked across the country. The Elementary Education program is in the top 2% for all U.S. colleges, and the Engineering and Buissness programs are also excellent. The only down side is that the University does not have a Health program. Pre-Health studies can be accomplished here, but after those courses are completed, students may need to transfer to another school to complete the program.', ""Live on campus your first year, preferably, south campus. The friendships I've made have meant the world to me. Living on campus can be just as cheap as living off. Don't be afraid to be in a ghetto building. That's part of the college experience. Also, do your homework. Not only the homework from your classes, but look into finding the best deals for food, books, and housing. Saving money becomes a lot easier when you do your research."", 'Utah State is home. Sure, the academic portion of the university is superb, however, Utah State offers much more than an education. It offers involvement, leadership, service opportunities, companionship, character building, and the feeling of being part of something more.']]",Utah State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Utah-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/80792,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,100,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00070-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905005679,904812062,HORIZONTAL,"07/13/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 30 out of 30 people found this review useful. 1 of 256 Alexis from Heber City, UT Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You have access to the on campus gym. The entire bus system for Logan is always there to take you anywhere. Entrance to most concerts, art exhibits, plays, and sporting events. While I don't like that the cost has increased a lot since I started here, it's still pretty well priced in comparison to other schools for what you get."", ""There's hiking trails, rocks for climbing and small lakes up the canyon incredibly close to campus. It's about 30 minutes away from Bear Lake. There's parks and playgrounds, batting cages, golf courses, movie theaters, bowling alleys, improv groups like the Antics, billiards, rock climbing, exploring campus, geo-caching and amazing restaurants. Some of the restaurants you'll find only in Logan. At the Fun Park alone there's country swing dancing, roller skating, bowling, arcade and laser tag. Going to sporting events is always an experience, and you feel a great sense of unity. Unfortunately it's a smaller town so not everything is open really late."", ""The cafe in the library has saved me a couple times.

USU has police emergency buttons all over campus. They are these tall posts that have a button and intercom. if you push it, you are instantly connected with the USU dispatch, and an officer will come over right away. You can use this button whenever, and it's not only for emergencies. We were constantly told in our Dorm Safety meetings that if we were walking around campus being followed, or just feel unsafe and would like an escort, to push the button. You are never far from one of these towers, and there are some around every dorm as well, just in case of an emergency in the dorms. There are always a bunch of officers around USU, and most of them are very friendly. I've had a couple of rude run-ins with the USU coppers, but they are great guys."", ""A few years ago a young man died of alcohol poisoning at a party/frat hazing some kids that were part of the frat were hosting. Obviously, the frat didn't validate this activity, the kids did it of their own will, but right after that USU got rid of nearly all frats and sororities with the exception of a couple who are watched like hawks and are some of the top, most popular, and most honorable Greek divisions in the country, who actually do a lot of good for the campus and community. I still hear of some wild stories every once and a while, but definitely not as bad as probably every other school, i.e. University of Utah.... THAT school is the frat party school, not USU."", ""I will admit I didn't participate in many clubs, but it seems that USU has a very good club base, and it's easy for anyone who wants to form a new club to do so. I have seen flyers for clubs for everything! USU has plenty of activities, too, as you can see from what I've said in the rest of my review! USU is NOT a boring school. At all."", 'Everyone and Anyone! All will be welcomed, and all will find a place to belong at this diverse school!!', ""Honestly, USU is full of these. When I talk to people who go to other schools, I'm always getting the reaction of really??? USU is such an active and social school with so many activities... the amount in itself seems unusual for schools. The most popular and wide-known tradition, which other schools have mimicked but it started at USU, is True Aggie Night. There is an A statue by Old Main Hill. Every month on the night of the full moon the Student Housing and Activities decorates it, puts two ladders on it, one on either side. Everyone gathers at the statue, there's lights and music, and students can get on top of the statue and kiss in front of everyone to become True Aggies. One rule, you need to kiss a True Aggie to become one, with the exception of Homecoming night where any 2 people can kiss. You get a little card stating you're a True Aggie with who turned you and everything. It's a pretty big tradition! Another one is the HOWL. It's the biggest Halloween party in Utah, with so many activities and big wig entertainers. Famous DJs DJ the HUGE dance hall, and in past years performers have included Massive Monkees, The Higher, Tyrone Wells, We the Kings, Cartel, mentalist Craig Karges, Magician Dan Martin, and so much in between. USU dance crews also perform amazing numbers and the crews and performing arts students walk around in costume and character freaking people out, giving the whole party a certain ambiance. They can be pretty freaky! Another tradition is called the Finals Howl. on a designated day at midnight the week of finals, the silence rule is dropped and all students are allowed to relieve there studying frustrations through howling in the library. Aggie Fest at the end of the year is always a party, too. Famous performers come for that as well. Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Sean Kingston, Cameron Rafati are a few who have graced us! the USU vs. BYU football game is a big deal at USU, too. Since so many students want to go but the stadium can only hold so many, in order to get your wristband to get into the game, you need to participate in the Camp-out on the Quad.... everyone camps out on the Quad, a huge grass area behind Old Main. USU Basketball is a huge deal, too! USU students love there Spectrum Stadium and their Basketball team. You have not had the full experience unless you go to a Spectrum game! USU likes their zombies, too. a new recent tradition is the Humans vs. Zombies tag game. Google it! everyone starts as humans with the exception of some OZ's, Original Zombies, and the humans get to use nerf guns and sock balls to defend themselves from humans. I can't explain all of the awesomeness. Seriously, GOOGLE IT."", ""Yes, you get plenty of bang for your buck. The ratio of awesome to your cash (which isn't a small amount, but USU is still the cheapest university in Utah! And its education is just as good as BYU or U of U if not better!) is ever in your favor. It√É\x83√Ç¬¢√É\x82?√É\x82?s like pure Sodium in distilled water. BIG bang for your buck!"", ""Like I had said in the Dorm Life section, the Housing and Student Life committee ALWAYS plans stuff for students to do! BUT in this section, I want to dispel a myth about USU that lingers, and had my parents going against USU for a long time.... It is NOT a dangerous party school! USU is actually a very safe place. It did have a prior (and I mean a LONG time ago) rep of being a party school, but this is not a direct reflection on USU, but the off campus housing. (see Greek Life and Campus Safety sections) USU provides plenty of alcohol and drug free activities for their students. Logan is also a very fun and diverse place. There are tons of amazing little shops, eateries, parks, and places to explore. Logan sits between 4+ gorgeous canyons, and the prettiest one, Logan Canyon, is less than a minute from campus. It provides river rafting, tubing, ATVs and dirt bikes, hiking, snowmobiling, rock climbing, mountain biking, fishing, skiing, camping, and any other activity. USU also has a student activities center where students can rent recreational equipment and get lessons for FREE, or for such a small charge, say, 5 dollars a person, it's ridiculous. USU is also an hour or less from 6 lakes, including the popular Bear Lake and it's surrounding towns (about 30 min away) There are a lot of parks, golf courses, and Cache Valley Mall isn't big, at ALL, but it doesn't waste space, either. Every store in there is a great store and they have great selections. Only thing it needs is a Macy*s anf a Victoria Secret. Also the area has a lot of other good stores. Every major grocer and a few minor ones (but I don't recall a Harmons) Shopko, K-Mart, 2 Walmarts, Sears, Sams Club, TJ Maxx and Ross, Best Buy, Hobby Lobby.... It may be a rural town but it has everything! The Student HYPER building is the activity/exercise/student health building. It has an array of workout equipment, classes and clubs for fitness, and a great pool! Basketball and Volleyball areas are nice, too. There are plenty of places for the staple of movies and bowling, though I do wish The Pie Pizzeria would build a place in Logan, they have one in every other college town in Utah!"", ""The food at USU is pretty good, it all depends on what you're used to. If you're used to your mom being a 5 star chef, then you're going to get a little homesick from time to time. But they do have something for everyone, I had some SUPER picky friends up there and they weren't bothered too much. The only thing is how EXPENSIVE the meal plan is!! And for 90% of on-campus housing you're required to but a meal plan, either a minimum of 7 or 10 meals/wk (which 10 is plenty) The larger the meal plan you buy the cheaper each individual meal is, but not by much. My first year a meal plan of 10/wk averaged to a little over 8 dollars a meal. That's the most expensive part of living on-campus, the meal plan was more than my rent! There are 2 student eateries, The Junction in Central Campus (closest to all the Freshmen housing) and The Marketplace (in the student center) both of these places are all you can eat and have plenty of choices, though I always liked The Marketplace the best. There are 3 other spots you can use your meal plans at, but you transfer a meal into 5 dollars to spend there. Another thing with the whole student meal thing is you have to eat your food in the dining room, and you can't take ANY out. I can understand them not wanting to be the student pantry, but I wish we could take a tray or a to-go container dinner. But the dining room was always a good place to be social and meet people."", ""From what I hear about other schools, USU has the best dorm life of any school in this side of the United States. It all starts with the RA's (Resident Assistants... basically your dorm supervisor) USU hires the most fun, bright, nice, honorable, exciting, friendly RA's! All of the RA's then plan with other Housing Officials frequent activities that are always a blast! Sometimes they are campus wide and so every student will be informed, and sometimes just each section of housing (Central, southern, or Student Living campuses) will create their own events- but everyone is invited! They plan Human vs. Zombies tag games (it's actually an official league thing, Google it!), The HOWL (the largest Halloween party in Utah), tailgate parties, BBQs, water parties, movie parties, several week-long carnivals/parties, and all sorts of get-togethers. RA's will even plan special weekly activities just for their floor/wing to help the residents befriend each other and get the most from their college experience. Some are fun, and sometimes we have serious talks.... Though I've never heard The Talk presented in such an educational, un-awkward, and actually funny/fun way! My RA my first year (I lived in Valley View Tower on Central Campus) would do MMM night on our floor... Movie Manicure Mondays. we'd all meet in the basement TV room at 9 or 10 Monday night and watch a movie and do each other's nails. She would provide a ton of food too, it was a great way for the floor to bond! Once we had a building-wide social about self-image, and destroying stereotypes and cliques. Our RA's, the best ladies you will EVER meet, all dressed up as the extreme of their stereo type or adopted another and did a cat walk. They wrote their own introductions that had funny parts, but then got down to the nitty gritty of how stereo types have affected their character's life. It was very touching. The RA's really care about their tenants! The cleaning and maintenance staff at USU are very friendly as well, and pro at what they do! It's a great way to meet the men and ladies :) When the snow is 3 feet deep or it's raining like the flood, its nice to be right on campus. The only cons I have towards Dorms/on-campus housing are 1) price, it definitely is cheaper to live off campus, 2) It can sometimes be a distraction from the real reason you're there, YOUR EDUCATION, because you make friends and just want to hang out with them, 3) It's the same at any school, but sometimes the close proximity to so many girls/guys can create drama"", 'The Academic Rigor at USU really differs... Classes for your major(s) are usually difficult but very educational. Professors really want you to have an open mind, come up with your own ideas, and succeed. They want you to know your stuff inside, out, backwards, forwards, and every direction in between. USU classes are still very fun though, along with being educational. Hands on and participation are a must! You Breadth and generals classes can be a little more chill, where they focus on giving you more broadening your horizons experiences. They still take effort and still can present challenges though; you will not get bored with any class you take.', ""My tips are these: - Utah State offers an amazing social life, probably the most fulfilling at any school around, but don't let it affect your studies! - Include in your school shopping list a raincoat/umbrella, rain/snow boots, a good coat and rain jacket, but some tank tops as well. It's either pouring, a blizzard, or scorching hot! - Participate. In class you won't have a choice, at USU it's kind of a requirement. -Eat Aggie Ice Cream! And go to a Basketball and a Hockey game at least once - Sing the Scotsmen or you will die."", ""Utah State University gives us students a wonderful mixture of the best of ALL college worlds. It's a small town feel but not missing any commodities or social life, and then offers a top class education in all areas-especially engineering, business, and education- without paying top dollar! Utah State University steals the hearts of all students, prospective or already enrolled, the second you step foot on the beautiful campus.""]]",Utah State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Utah-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/80792,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,123,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00070-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905005679,904812062,HORIZONTAL,"07/13/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 30 out of 30 people found this review useful. 1 of 256 Alexis from Heber City, UT Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I go to the Quadside Cafe and they have the best wraps in the world! There is also a lot of food options in Logan that are to die for good. The great thing about Logan is that is has a lot of individual local restaurants that are very good. My favorite would have to be The Crepery. Their crepes are the best and so is their hot cocoa. There is also a fantastic Italian place called Le Nonne and the delicious local diner called Angie's which is famous for clean the sink challenge and the Tripe-Double burger. Logan also has a lot of the popular restaurants ranging from McDonald's and Wendy's to The Olive Garden and Texas Roadhouse."", ""I haven't ever lived in a dorm, but where I have stayed is off-campus and it is so much fun! There are so many people to meet and a lot of parties to attend. The social level definitely lowers in the winter because it is so cold, but when it is warm, people have their doors open, they are always playing football, chatting in the sun, and so much more. There is so much to do with others even when it's cold."", ""I would say depending on the classes, it could be between four to five stars. My major is pretty intense and all of those classes have been had. My generals have also been a lot harder than I ever expected. It especially makes it hard when you don't really care about the subject."", 'It is really helpful to know what your major is before you come to college. That way, you can start your degree right off and get done in the time you want. I would live off-campus as well. They say that as a Freshman you should live on-campus because you are more involved. That is not true. I have only ever lived off-campus and it is a blast! Plus, you get to meet more older people which is really fun. Make sure you get your homework done. I know this is hard to do, but if you get it done early, you can party more.', 'Utah State is a very fun place to be and is in a very pretty part of Utah in the Logan, Cache Valley area. You can come up here to get an amazing education while also getting to have fun and meet new people.

I like to go to the movies, go bowling, go to school dances, school movies, play sports. There are facilities that the students can use to go play sports. I like playing basketball and racquetball. We have courts designated for a lot of sports. It's pretty fun."", 'The food at Utah State is really good. They offer a lot of dining choices. There are places to eat in the main building on campus and even in the library. The food is good and the prices are pretty reasonable as well. I eat on campus frequently.', ""I've never lived on campus in the dorms, but I hear they are really fun. There, you can make really good friends. There are always different dorm activities that are done and you get to meet new people all the time. Living close to campus is a plus, because if you want, you can sleep in for a few extra minutes."", ""I'm going into the nursing field and the classes I take are pretty difficult; but are do-able if you put in the work. Now, not all classes are extremely difficult, there are classes that are fairly easy compared to others. I say you do have to put in some effort in all the classes you take."", ""Utah State offers so much. There are many fields that you can go into. Find the right field by taking different classes and seeing what you like. Be sure to not slack off on your studies. You don't want to get behind. There is always time to have fun here at Utah State and get school work done; you just gotta find the balance. This college is an amazing college to start off in."", 'Fun school with such a great environment both on and off campus. Classes are just the right size to where you feel like you can have one-on-one interactions with the teachers.

The mountains are close and allow for weekend ski/snowboard trips that students and professors love.', 'What can I say? It is all you can eat and it is quite popular to find a quiet seat in the side room of the main cafeteria during dead week or finals week and eat and study all day for multiple meals while only paying once.

The two most popular majors are education and engineering at USU because we are most well known for those.

Invest in really warm clothes and coats and extra blankets! Get to know your professors, they are actually really helpful with class and other classes. Get involved!!

On homecoming night at midnight, when you kiss on top of the A, you become a true aggie. Homecoming night there is a line of hundreds and hundreds of people who have picked someone (stranger, friend, or significant other) to kiss on the A. For those who aren't into kissing someone in front of a crowds, there is a tradition called night on the quad. This is for all the die-hard football fans. Everyone brings tents and camps out on the quad to wait for tickets for our rival game (against BYU-best rivalry we have).

The campus is very well lite during the night, and security officers are always on campus. If any problems do occur, such as injury or a threat to personal safety, Utah State has an on campus emergency system where visitors can call for help with the push of a button with one of the several emergency aid posts situated on campus.', 'Most of the Greek Houses are located very close to campus, and have a large variety. Sorority houses are closest to campus, while frat houses are a little further down the hill.

With a large variety of clubs ranging from engineering clubs to big band swing, you will find plenty of things to do during you collage experience. There are countless club sports as well, including soccer, rugby, hand ball, and many more. Be sure to support the school teams, as entrance at games is also free of charge.', 'Utah State is full of Engineers. If you are wanting to go into the hard sciences than this is the right school to go to. The Engineering program here is excellent and challenging. They also offer great programs for pilots, and a music therapy program hard to find anywhere else.', ""Utah State has many proud traditions, such as True Aggie Night, The Howl Halloween Dance, and the Midnight Howl. If you are feeling stressed out during studies, than go to the library and participate in the midnight howl. Students at the library will take a break to get a laugh while howling at the moon. Or if this isn't your style, go to The Junction for some Midnight Pizza."", ""Collage is expensive in general, but Utah state truly uses the founds to take care of their students. There are many programs set up, such as a health care plan, a gym, writing labs, and many more. Be sure to take advantage of these systems, as your student fees are paying for them. If you do, you will get your money's worth for sure."", 'There are a few movie theaters, a bowling/skating alley nearby, and an ice skating rink, but most of what you will want to do for fun will be outdoors activities.

Utah State also provides rentals of almost any equipment you would need, including snow shoes.', ""Utah State University has several dinning options available. There are great sandwich/coffee houses by the library, and an on campus dinner called Morty's has the best hamburger I've eaten in Logan. The two most popular options include The Marketplace, and The Junction. Both are all you can eat style and are included with the meal plan. Other on campus options can be used through a cash exchange system with the meal plan, but this is limited."", ""Dorm life is great. I have lived both on and off campus, and had a lot more fun living on campus. However, living off campus proved to be more affordable for me. Explore your options. If you want to have a fun social experience, than dorms can help provide that. If you want to be more focused on your studies, the dorms can provide a lot of distractions, but also keep you close to school various resources, such as writing labs, professor's offices, tutors, and more. Generally living on campus will be cheaper, but there are many options for you to explore."", 'Utah State offers many challenging courses, and professors really push you to expand your horizons. Many of the math and science classes will prove difficult, but supplementary instruction (additional time for review and explanation purposes) is provided for many of the more difficult classes. Take advantage of these aids and you will be able to take much more from the classes.', 'If you need financial aid, be sure to apply early. The Financial Aid office can help you. Utah state has many available on campus housing options, but many require a meal plan. This makes these housing options much more expensive than they appear. Though it is nice not to have to cook, it may be cheaper to live off campus where you will have access to a kitchen and are not required to pay for a meal plan.', 'Excellent collage environment, and a fun city to live in. Utah State offers a large variety of classes, and have relatively cheap housing options close to campus.
