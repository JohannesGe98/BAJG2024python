However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

College is an amazing experience and it is definitely a wild time. I think it is very important to enjoy yourself in college and allow yourself to meet new people and engage in diverse activities.

Just remember that the main point of college is to graduate and further your future with an education.

Regardless, the price is definitely worth all of the experiences and memories I have because of attending ASU.', 'I absolutely love living in Tempe and attending ASU.

If you actively participate and devote your attention in all of your classes, you have the potential to gain knowledge from every class you take. As well as learning in the classroom, I learned the most outside of the classroom. The independence that comes with college gave me the opportunity to learn about myself and what kind of person I want to be.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They are almost always willing to help you with anything you need and there are oftentimes where your class will have a graduate student helping. The TAs are the best resource you will have in your classes. They understand the stress of being a student and oftentimes will help you even more than your professor.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', 'ASU is a great college for almost any student, because of all the ways to get involved in the school. There is a team for almost every sport under the sun. There are clubs dedicated to almost anything and everything. And, for the science geeks like myself, there is always the opportunity to get involved in the research on campus. Any student willing to get involved will have a great experience.', ""Don't be afraid or intimidated by your professors. They are there to help you and your fellow students. If you don't understand a concept in class, go visit the professor during his/her office hours and ask. And make friends in your classes. That way, whenever you are absent, you can get a copy of the notes from the day you missed. Also, you'll have a study-buddy for exams and finals. And, also, go to class. Coming from someone who is juggling a part time job on top of a full time schedule and finds it difficult to make it to class sometimes, going to class and actually paying attention really pays off. You know what the professor emphasizes in class, and have a better idea of what to expect on exams and such."", ""As an instate student paying around $8000 a year for college (includes tuition, class fees, etc.), I can say that college is obviously expensive. But for what you pay, ASU offers you a good bit in return. On the Tempe campus, there are at least three libraries, one of which is open 24/7, for your research projects and homework. There are several opportunities to get involved in different areas of research, based on personal interests. It's not as cheap as a community college, but it does offer a lot more opportunity to apply your knowledge than some other colleges."", ""Honestly, the school is a great one, with plenty of ways to enjoy oneself while on campus. Last year, while living on campus, there was always something to do with my friends, be it going to watch a movie in the Harry Potter room in the Barrett dining hall, or going bowling in Sparky's Den. I miss a lot of that now that I am living back at home."", 'The potential to learn a lot is there, but the professors do not spoon-feed information. It is up to the students to take initiative and responsibility for their own learning. The professors are (almost) always willing to help a student who shows an interest in helping themselves. And the only reason I say almost is because there are always going to be those one or two professors who make it seem like a chore to help their students.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,94,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents.

Have a general idea of what you want to do, and if not, change your major! Try new classes! I switched my major three times and I am so thankful I did! Everything I learned helped me discover what I want to do with my life. Live on campus your first year!!! I cannot express this enough. You will build lasting friendships, and if you live in Downtown Phoenix, you will either have your own room and bathroom, or you will share a bathroom with one other person. No community showers! It's amazing. Get a job on campus. It's a great way to make extra money and they have flexible hours. Learn a skill. Take classes you are interested in. You need electives to graduate, so have fun while doing it. Talk to your adviser. They are there for a reason! They want to help. Don't be afraid of professors. They are smart and they know how to help you. You will become friends with them and if they know you on a personal level, they are more likely to help your grade at the end of the semester. Join a club, and if they don't have a club you want, start it! I started sign language club because they did not have it. It has been a huge success and it's a resume booster. Talk to students when you tour the campus. They will tell you more than your tour guide. Also, if you are interested in the nursing program, you may want to consider another university. It is practically impossible to get in. 4.0 students are turned away every semester. So do your research."", ""Although ASU is continuously increasing tuition, the amount of material you learn and the life skills and tools you'll use later in life are definitely worth the extra expenses. I would suggest taking gen ed classes like english and math courses at a community college before attending here because then you don't have to spend the same amount of money for a low level class as you would for an advanced class. The dorms are a bit pricey as well, but that is a matter of location. You are in the heart of Downtown Phoenix and you pay for the convenience."", 'I live on the Downtown Phoenix campus which is very different from Tempe, West or Poly. Some people complain that it is too professional or not the typical college experience, but the campus is filled with students who are motivated and succeeding in their perspective careers. I work at a TV station and also for the Phoenix Suns. Businesses want to hire students from the Downtown campus because it is so convenient. You are in the heart of the action in the eyes of professionals. The dorms are quiet and gorgeous! You should definitely live on campus. They have amazing programs and you will meet so many quality people. I love it here.', 'I am a journalism student at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. I have switched my major a few times from journalism to kinesiology and health and wellness, and have found myself back into journalism. Every class I have taken, even the gen ed classes have been beneficial. Almost all of the professors I have had have been devoted to making sure you get the most out of your education and care about how much material you are learning that will help your future career. They really want you to succeed and what they teach reflects that.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,95,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities.

On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can.

You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

ASU has it's perks by being one of the most diverse universities-both ethnically, culturally, and every personality, age, height, religion of person out there all under the same roof of learning. As for my major, this is a great perk as I'm surrounded by students who are wanting the same major but different goals in life, I get learn so much of the backgrounds and lives and insight of these people.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do.

I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Very easy to stay healthy because you get a free gym membership to the student recreation center which has everything from a pool to tennis courts to basketball courts. You have to walk everywhere on campus because they don't have streets for cars so you will loose weight/tone up. Great places to eat close buy, just watch what you eat. Made a lot of friends fast.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents.

In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class.

I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant.

There is probably something that just about any person can enjoy at ASU, they have a wide variety of clubs, sports and classes with varying levels of difficulty. If you love to get involved in your schools activities this would probably be a wonderful school for you.', ""I highly recommend carrying a map with you wherever you go when on campus. It is laid out very well and isn't to difficult to find your way around but having a map on you still isn't too bad an idea just because of the size. I would also recommend taking one of the schools guided tours to familiarize yourself with the campus. The tours are led by students and they can give you tips on getting around."", 'ASU id definitely a pricey school, especially with all the increase in tuition, however if you really do throw yourself into life at this school it would probably be something that you would consider worth it. You might want to consider taking some of the basic courses like English 101 and 102 and a community college and focus on the harder courses at ASU.', ""When I first started at ASU it was difficult for me to adjust since I went to a extremely small high school. However I adjusted rather quickly and while I don't really take part in anything its fun to walk around campus and see what everyone else is doing."", 'I am learning a whole lot here and a lot of times the teachers do try and make a really dry and boring subject as interesting as they can.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""Since ASU is such a large university, no one is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. You have to go out and find all of your own opportunities (i.e. scholarships, assistant positions, etc.). The opportunities are definitely there (trust me, there are plenty of them), it's just up to you to go after them. ASU is great for the types of students who are able and willing to seek out their own opportunities and endeavors. Even if you are not (I wasn't when I first started out), ASU is a great place for you to learn how to."", ""Get to know your professors! Building student-teacher relationships is really important for getting more opportunities (i.e. letters of recommendation, teaching assistant/research assistant positions). Plus, they can serve as your mentors and help you with just about anything. Don't overdo yourself. Some students get really excited at the thought of college and immediately sign themselves up for everything they can. As the semester goes on, they are worn down and exhausted. Find some things that you are interested in and get involved, just don't overdo it. ASU has a lot of opportunities, so finding stuff to get involved in is easy. Don't skip class! A lot of people enjoy the freedom of college where the professors don't take attendance. However, these students usually end of paying the price with a failing grade. Yes, you will find some really easy classes where a lot of students skip and end up doing okay. But, for the most part, skipping class is a bad idea. Most of my professors have designed their classes so that the exams are designed so the that the material comes from 50% lecture and 50% text book. Therefore, attending class (and taking notes) is crucial to your grade. I know a lot of people who skipped class and ended up failing and having to re-take it. If you have room in your schedule, take a class that interests you that is not related to your major. Sometimes, you may feel overwhelmed by all of your classes that have to do with engineering, business, psych, or whatever your major may be. Taking an unrelated class lets you take a break. I took a calligraphy class and it turned out to be really relaxing! Meet people! When you take your first classes in college, you are most likely going to be in huge lecture halls with 100 or 200 other students. Many of these kids with be with you until the end of your college years. Meet them! Then you can work together on homework, projects, etc. and help each other out. Having people to who are going through the same challenges as you is really nice to have. You can work through it and study together. Plus, you get to make a lot more new friends! Live in the dorm for at least your first year. Living in the dorm is how you meet most of your college friends because you are always on campus. I have friends that have never lived in a dorm and it was much harder for them to meet people and make new friends. I also have friends who moved off campus after freshman year and regretted it. They said they felt cut off from everyone else because they weren't on campus as much."", ""Because ASU is a public institution, the tuition is much cheaper than the private schools' tuition. Especially because I am in the honors college (which has it's own community), I get the feel of attending a small liberal arts college with the opportunities of a large university. So, I get the best of both worlds at the cost of $9,000 a year. It's awesome!"", ""There is so much to do here. Because ASU is such a large university, there are so many opportunities, both academically and socially. There are so many clubs! There is pretty much every kind of club you can imagine. If ASU doesn't have it, then you can start it (it's really easy). I am involved in a bunch of organizations and have leadership positions in a few of them. It has been so much fun! Since ASU is a large research institute, there are plenty of opportunities for research assistant positions and teaching assistant positions. Some incoming freshman may think that these positions sound boring, but they turned out to be a lot of fun and they also serve as great learning experiences. Not to mention, they look really good on the resume for grad school! I am in the honors college, so I got to live in the BRAND NEW dorms! They are really nice! I had an apartment style dorm, so I had my own room and three suitemates. My dorm also had two bathrooms (so I only had to share with one other person and I got my own sink!), a living room and kitchenette with a dining area. The dorm came with a fridge, kitchen sink, chairs, desks, tables, a couch and an entertainment stand. So, I didn't have to bring that much stuff."", ""Most people don't like taking the introductory classes (i.e. 101 classes) because they are so broad. Don't worry though! After freshman year, you can take the upper division classes, which are a lot more interesting. I have loved all of my classes so far and I have definitely learned a lot from them. The higher level the class, the smaller the class size is as well, which allows the professors to get to know you better. The higher level classes cover much more challenging and in depth information, so it helps to know your professor so he/she can help you with any material you may be struggling with.""]]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,137,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am.

I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August.

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do.

I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents.

In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

ASU not only had one of the lowest tuition rates (both in- and out-of-state) out of the entire United States, it also offered me the highest scholarship. That alone made Arizona State University, financially, the best university that I have found, but in addition to this, ASU was one of the best quality schools. First of all, ASU has one of the top Honors colleges in the nation, for good reason. This honors college at ASU has many dedicated staff members. These staff members get to personally know the students and go out of their way to hold workshops outside of class to help students write better papers, and even take the time to write helpful comments/criticisms on essay assignments. In addition to this, ASU has dining halls open for fourteen hours during week days and thirteen hours during weekends, as well as markets that offer food in exchange for meals from meal plans until 2 am during week days and midnight on weekends; the dining halls and markets also post nutrition facts about all of the food served for those wishing to eat healthier and those with allergies. In addition to this, the lounge facilities (ping pong tables, billiards, etc.) are free to use, and the recreation center has a low membership fee, as well as various free exercise classes. Furthermore, ASU has a free Flash bus system which travels around the Tempe campus, as well as buses/shuttles which travel between all of the ASU campuses; the metro bus/light rail system also offers great ticket deals for ASU students. Several businesses surrounding ASU also have many good deals for students, in addition to different temporary boutiques that businesses host on campus with inexpensive items such as jewelry and books.', 'Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢\x80\x94my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college.

In just my Greek class, I have learned about not only ancient Greek texts, such as the Iliad by Homer, Apology of Socrates by Aristotle, and Life of Alexander [the Great] by Plutarch, but I have also learned how to closely analyze texts based on diction, figurative language, and allusions from Greek myths, as well as various other literary techniques. Because of this, I have been able to apply these techniques to my honors Human Event class, in which students are expected to be able to closely analyze philosophical texts such as Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes and The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. This will also help me in my English course next semester, and will continue to aid me as I seek a degree in English and a certificate in creative writing. In addition to my ancient Greek class, I am also in French. In my French class, we have learned more verb tenses, specifically past tenses, and more vocabulary. Because of this new knowledge of verb tenses, I am better able to tell stories of events that have occurred, as well as read and comprehend more French texts. In addition to this, my increasing knowledge of the French language and culture due to this class has allowed me to connect with other people, not only students, from around the world. In addition to this, I have also learned much in my Java programming class. In this class, I have learned how to write simple programs that display text on a monitor, Ã¢\x80\x9cmad libÃ¢\x80? programs, and even bank account programs that allow the user to create a bank account to deposit, withdraw, add interest, and display an account summary.

I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting.

Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost.

It is extremely helpful when your professors know who you are because it allows you to ask them questions and get a response back promptly.', 'Though I believe college is expensive, ASU makes up for this with plenty of exciting events for students to attend with free food (though we technically paid for this), movie nights, bounce houses, and many other awesome events such as the carnival and haunted house at West for Homecoming. It is all up to the students to be involved and attend these events in order to get bang for the buck.', 'At ASU West, I enjoy that there are no distractions since the campus is so calm, yet I can leave the dorm, catch a shuttle, and arrive in Tempe when need be. I find the students here easy to befriend and all the professors that I have had have great attitudes and enthusiasm about their subject area. It is also nice to have a short ten to fifteen minute walk to classes and the food here is pretty great.', 'Every single teacher that I have had at ASU West has been dedicated to my learning and my success. Each one makes sure to respond quickly to any questions I have sent regarding homework or large assignments and each has helped me to understand various complicated such as how to teach to a student who has a learning disability versus a student who has autism. Moreover, the classes are challenging for students, which provides a great opportunity to grow.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,163,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Snobbery, while sometimes demonstrated, is not directed toward each other, I've felt."", 'Apply to Barrett early!! Competition is increasing every year and it is getting more and more difficult to get into. Visit! Eat at the dining hall, our food is delicious:) Really approach Barrett, and indeed every school you are interested in, with an open mind!! All the praise in the world from others could be worthless if you do not fall in love with the college. Listen to yourself above all, and really take into account whether or not you can see yourself building a life there. That is what is important to remember about college: this is an entire life, the starting point for adulthood, and you must be comfortable growing as a person there and having all the experiences you feel are necessary.', 'Tuition has recently been raised, and Barrett housing and dining costs are extremely expensive--the highest in ASU, if I am not mistaken. ASU did give me several scholarships which put quite a dent in my expenses, but I still have money to worry about.', ""I was always an extremely shy person in school, and was very apprehensive coming into college. I found it very easy to meet new people, however, and have made some amazing friends who I am very close to and spend time with almost every day. Barrett has so many opportunities for get-togethers and group activities, and supports its students in whatever they want to do. I was recently extremely impressed by Barrett because they paid for my and several other students tickets to the TEDxPhoenix conference, which I wouldn't have been able to attend otherwise due to the steep cost of the tickets. Thanks to the administration I was able to listen to some of the most incredible talks I have ever heard, and have since become involved in TED events on campus. I can't speak highly enough about the attention Barrett gives its students."", ""I am a student at Barrett, the Honors College, and am truly loving it. The Human Event course is a Barrett signature course that every freshman takes: there are so many amazing professors teaching it and the discussions and essays are, while nerve-wracking at first, introduce you to incredible new ideas. I have never been as consistently fascinated by anything as I am by this class! I have only just finished my first semester as a French major (and am changing it to Art History), so as for classes in the rest of the university, my opinions are based only on the introductory courses that ASU students must take to advance within their major. I have had good professors and TA's, and I am confident that my experience will only improve as I continue in the program.""]]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,165,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means.

With mill avenue, Tempe market place, and various other venues there is plenty of things to do. ASU isn't a hard school and the classes are mostly relaxed. Don't go in nervous because everything is a lot less nerve racking then you think."", ""Always go to class! This is a saying that adults tell kids all the time. I found out the hard way that this is a very true statement. Though missing a few classes won't hurt it is important to go most of the time so you learn the information that will be on exams. In many classes professors take attendance randomly to see who actually attends class. Also, try to find the cheapest books you can! They are very expensive and are used most of the time. I would recommend either getting your books a week or so before classes start(if a class has reading due on the first day) or waiting till after classes start to see if you really need all the books the professors assign. With these books do the reading! If you fall behind catch up. Don't let yourself get far behind because it will be impossible to catch up. Near exam times at the end of the semester professors like to have exams on the same day. If this happens and you haven't read the material, studying becomes extremely hard. Near finals if your grades don't seem where you want them to be, don't fret because most of the time your final grade will be higher then you think. Just study for the exams and everything should go good! My last tip would be to go out, explore, and make friends. College is a time to learn Anout yourself and grow as a person.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party.

If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation.

I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus.

However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is not",True,0,0,,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class.

So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class.

I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class.

Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October.

I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool.

The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class.

So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class.

I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time.

In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There are a lot of cool people but if you're straight edge or close to it, you really have to search for fun things to do. Am learning a lot It's really all about how much you engage in your classes.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus!

"[['Categories', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', 'Arizona State University is overall a fun school. You have all the different kind of clubs. Name a random type of club and I will guarantee that it is available here on campus. There are also the sports. Students will go all out to support all of our teams from the football games to basketball games; you will see them there cheering our team on. Greek life is also entertaining to students here at Arizona State University. I am currently not in Greek life, but I do plan on joining a sorority next semester. Greek life does so much volunteering and community service such as raising money for charities or other organizations. I think it would be so much fun to be a part of a sorority and to get to know the people that will be a part of my life forever. There is also the annual Undie Run which is an event in which students undress to dress people who do not have money for clothes. It is a fun day but at the same time it helps people with needs. There is no way that Arizona State University does not have anything to do for fun. The list that I named above is only little things that this University has to offer its students. Arizona State University is nothing but fun.', 'The food and dining at Arizona State University is absolutely incredible. There are so many different varieties of foods that students can get. There is Mexican food, Chinese food, Italian food, etc. There is also a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice for students who like to drink coffee or smoothies. ASU amazes me with all the food and dining that they have available for us students. There is also Maroon and Gold, also known as M&G, which is another way of paying for food for ASU students and it is much cheaper. Meal plans are also great for food and dining and are a great convenience if they want more of a home cooked meal. In the end, the food and dining on campus has satisfied my hunger every single time.', 'My freshmen year I decided to live at home because it was the cheaper way out. I would have loved to live on campus to experience campus life and to just experience being on my own. Unfortunately, I was not able to do either of those, but I was able to visit my friends that did live on campus. One of my very good friends would always have positive feedback from living on campus. She would say that it is hard at first transitioning from living with your parents to living on your own, but it is a great experience in the end. My friend would note that living on campus, it makes everything much closer. For example, if one would want some peace and quiet while studying, they could just simply walk over to the library instead of driving to campus to get to the library if one lived at home. Also, you can get to classes and extracurricular activities quickly without having to worry about transportation since you can walk to most places. Plus, there are a lot more opportunities to meet new people. You also get your first real sense of being independent and on your own without being completely thrown into the real world by yourself. Overall, living on campus is a great convenience for incoming students.', 'Last semester was tougher that this semester because of the fact that my major was Biology Human Genetics. I only had a hard time with my Biology class. I realized then that Biology was not the right major for me which is why I changed it to Accounting. My second semester was much more easier because the classes that I took were ones that I enjoyed. The classes were tough in my opinion were rigorous but are able to be overcome with studying. So, that is what I and any other college student would do. I studied to maintain good grades in each one of my classes. Overall, Arizona State University does have hard courses, but nothing is too hard unless students study.', 'My number one tip for future incoming students is to always go to class. For one, students pay thousands to be enrolled at Arizona State University, so why not take advantage of it? So students should go to class and pay attention because with these two tips, students are bound to get an A.', 'Being a student at Arizona State University has been a phenomenal experience. The professors that I have had for the past years have proved to me that they are there for every one of their students 100%. I rate Arizona State University a 10 out of 10 because of the campus life, the help and guidance that students get from faculty, and the education.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/108386,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,230,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00082-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,904838339,904641441,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation.

The MU also offers a variety of fast food restaurants such as Papa John's, Subway, and Chick-fil-A. These only accept M&G (maroon and gold dollars, an option to add on to meal plans) or real money."", ""Considering it IS a dorm, ASU has pretty good dorm life. Sign up for Hassayampa Academic Village. Although it's more expensive, it's definitely worth it. The rooms are bigger, newer, and more modern than any other dorms on campus (excluding the Honors College). Hassy is also organized by your individual college, so Business students are living together, Liberal Arts & Sciences students are living together, and so on. This helps you make friends within your major and classes."", ""Wherever you go, college is much more difficult than high school. If you need the extra challenge, there's Barrett the Honors College, which is a separate application."", 'Register early. The cluster of classes they make you do your first semester may seem stupid, but I made a lot of friends in my cluster, and we still keep in touch and take classes together. Intro to ASU is an easy A as long as you do the work, so do the work and help boost your GPA.', 'Overall, ASU is a fabulous university.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

But with the help of professors, study groups, teacher's assistants, tutoring centers, actually studying, and doing your work, you can succeed.

The more you know, the better you can further your education and make your stay at ASU easier. Ration your time well.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on.

Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can.

As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self.

I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus).

When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates.

Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}","07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams",True,0,0,,

These wires with pre-crimped terminals are equivalent to our premium jumper wires without the 1ÃƒÂ—1 crimp connector housings on the ends. By combining these wires with our crimp connector housings, you can quickly and easily create custom cables with 0.1"" (2.54mm) connectors that mate with various 0.1""-spaced connectors, including male and female headers and solderless breadboards. Just pick the housing for the correct number of pins, pick the colors and genders for your wires, and","These wires can be purchased with male terminals on both ends, female terminals on both ends, or one male and one female terminals.
