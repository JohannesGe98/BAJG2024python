Both films opened well and their respective studios should be happy, while the overall box office rose by 15% compared to last weekend hitting $187 million. Unfortunately, this is still 8% lower than this weekend last year. Had How to Train Your Dragon 2 matched higher expectations, 2014 would have won on the year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date, 2014 has earned $4.64 billion, putting it 3.0% ahead of 2013's pace of $4.50 billion, so this weekend's loss isn't a big deal. More..., 45767=June 17th, 2014, 55060=May 29th, 2014, 43400=June 25th, 2014, 66886=It has been a great year so far and April was again a strong month. The box office was led by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as it became the second film of the year to reach $200 million, while Rio 2 is on pace to become the seventh $100 million hit of the year. Big picture, 2014 has already hit $3 billion, which isn't a record for this time of the year, but it is $250 million ahead of 2013. That streak ends in May. Don't get me wrong. There are six films opening this month that at least have a shot at $100 million and two of those should earn more than $200 million and there are two others that at least have a shot at that milestone. Leading the way is The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is looking to top The Winter Soldier and become the second biggest hit of the year so far. Its main competition this month is X-men: Days of Future Past, while Godzilla also has a shot at $200 million. Unfortunately, this month last year, Iron Man 3 earned more than $400 million, while two other films took in $200 million and seven films in total reached the century mark. That is going to be really hard to replicate this year and 2014 will likely lose some of its lead over 2013. Fortunately, 2014 has such a big lead that unless the box office really slumps, it will end the month with at least a small lead over 2013. More..., 62510=May 22nd, 2014, 53786=It was a mostly good weekend at the box office with Maleficent earning first place with nearly $70 million, which was on the very high end of expectations. On the other hand, A Million Ways to Die in the West failed to match the low end of expectations. Overall, the box office pulled in $165 million, which is 11% lower than last weekend. That's not bad for a post-holiday weekend. Compared to last year, the box office was higher, albeit by 0.6%, which is much lower than ticket price inflation. Considering I thought it would be worse than this, I'm calling a 0.6% increase a victory. Year-to-date, 2014 remains ahead of 2013, but by $133 million or 3.3% at $4.16 billion to $4.02 billion. If June is as bad as May, then 2014 could slip behind 2013 entirely. More..., 57299=May 28th, 2014, 42014=July 2nd, 2014, 47143=June 12th, 2014, 60847=May 27th, 2014, 53528=June 2nd, 2014, 44871=There were three films that were in a virtual tie for top spot on the international top ten. Godzilla squeaked out a win with $38.4 million in 62 markets for totals of $248.7 million internationally and $440.2 million worldwide after a month of release. This includes a $37.00 million opening weekend in China. Needless to say, it earned first place in that market. The film finishes its international run in Japan at the end of July and it should jump over $500 million worldwide when it does. More..., 51797=June 4th, 2014, 40150=November 26th, 2014, 50073=June 5th, 2014, 38712=July 13th, 2015, 61136=X-Men: Days of Future Past easily won the weekend race at the box office earning more than $100 million over the four-day weekend. That's great news and it helped the overall box office grow by 5% to $187 million over the three-day weekend from last week. That's the good news. The bad news the other new release, Blended, bombed and the three-day weekend was down 27% from the same weekend last year. In fact, this year's four-day weekend total of $231 million was 9% lower than last year's three-day total and 26% lower than the four-day weekend from last year. That's a devastating collapse. The only saving grace is last year was a record-breaking Memorial Day long weekend, so a sharp drop-off isn't that unexpected. So far, 2014 has pulled in $3.95 billion, which is 4% more than 2013's running tally of $3.80 billion. More..., 48818=As expected, The Fault in Our Stars won the box office race this past weekend, while its opening weekend was on the very high end of expectations. (It did so with a surprisingly strong opening Friday, but more on that later.) The other wide release of the week, Edge of Tomorrow, did about as well as expected, which is to say it really struggled compared to its production budget. Overall, the box took in $163 million, which is 2% lower than last weekend. On the other hand, it is 9% higher than the same weekend last year, which is the far more important number. Year-to-date, 2014 has pulled in $4.38 billion, putting it 3.3% ahead of last year's pace of $4.24 billion. This is still a good margin and hopefully it will last. More..., 48536=June 9th, 2014, 64434=May 16th, 2014, 66601=May 1st, 2014, 44609=June 18th, 2014, 50355=This weekend, there are two wide releases coming out, one of which is the obvious potential monster hit and the other being the obvious counter-programing. On paper, Edge of Tomorrow is the obvious potential monster hit. It is a Sci-fi action film with a production budget that is nearly $200 million. The Fault in Our Stars is the obvious counter-programing. It is about two teen cancer patients who fall in love, which couldn't be farther away from a popcorn flick. However, the buzz really suggests The Fault in Our Stars could win. In fact, it could break the record for biggest opening for a romantic drama. This weekend last year, The Purge won with $34.06 million, while no other film earned more than $20 million. This year, three films might top $30 million and the winner could pull in more than $40 million. I think 2014 will win this weekend in the year-over-year competition. More..., 62799=It is Memorial Day long weekend and the box office is looking strong. X-Men: Days of Future Past should dominate the box office chart and there are some who think it will have the best opening of the year so far. Blended is playing the role of counter-programing this week and should do well in that role opening in third place. Meanwhile, the rest of the top five will be filled with Godzilla, Neighbors, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, all of which should still pull in $10 million or more.

Both films opened well and their respective studios should be happy, while the overall box office rose by 15% compared to last weekend hitting $187 million. Unfortunately, this is still 8% lower than this weekend last year. Had How to Train Your Dragon 2 matched higher expectations, 2014 would have won on the year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date, 2014 has earned $4.64 billion, putting it 3.0% ahead of 2013's pace of $4.50 billion, so this weekend's loss isn't a big deal.

The box office was led by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as it became the second film of the year to reach $200 million, while Rio 2 is on pace to become the seventh $100 million hit of the year. Big picture, 2014 has already hit $3 billion, which isn't a record for this time of the year, but it is $250 million ahead of 2013. That streak ends in May. Don't get me wrong. There are six films opening this month that at least have a shot at $100 million and two of those should earn more than $200 million and there are two others that at least have a shot at that milestone. Leading the way is The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is looking to top The Winter Soldier and become the second biggest hit of the year so far. Its main competition this month is X-men: Days of Future Past, while Godzilla also has a shot at $200 million. Unfortunately, this month last year, Iron Man 3 earned more than $400 million, while two other films took in $200 million and seven films in total reached the century mark. That is going to be really hard to replicate this year and 2014 will likely lose some of its lead over 2013. Fortunately, 2014 has such a big lead that unless the box office really slumps, it will end the month with at least a small lead over 2013. More..., 62510=May 22nd, 2014, 53786=It was a mostly good weekend at the box office with Maleficent earning first place with nearly $70 million, which was on the very high end of expectations. On the other hand, A Million Ways to Die in the West failed to match the low end of expectations. Overall, the box office pulled in $165 million, which is 11% lower than last weekend. That's not bad for a post-holiday weekend. Compared to last year, the box office was higher, albeit by 0.6%, which is much lower than ticket price inflation. Considering I thought it would be worse than this, I'm calling a 0.6% increase a victory. Year-to-date, 2014 remains ahead of 2013, but by $133 million or 3.3% at $4.16 billion to $4.02 billion. If June is as bad as May, then 2014 could slip behind 2013 entirely.

Godzilla squeaked out a win with $38.4 million in 62 markets for totals of $248.7 million internationally and $440.2 million worldwide after a month of release. This includes a $37.00 million opening weekend in China. Needless to say, it earned first place in that market. The film finishes its international run in Japan at the end of July and it should jump over $500 million worldwide when it does.

That's great news and it helped the overall box office grow by 5% to $187 million over the three-day weekend from last week. That's the good news. The bad news the other new release, Blended, bombed and the three-day weekend was down 27% from the same weekend last year. In fact, this year's four-day weekend total of $231 million was 9% lower than last year's three-day total and 26% lower than the four-day weekend from last year. That's a devastating collapse. The only saving grace is last year was a record-breaking Memorial Day long weekend, so a sharp drop-off isn't that unexpected. So far, 2014 has pulled in $3.95 billion, which is 4% more than 2013's running tally of $3.80 billion. More..., 48818=As expected, The Fault in Our Stars won the box office race this past weekend, while its opening weekend was on the very high end of expectations. (It did so with a surprisingly strong opening Friday, but more on that later.) The other wide release of the week, Edge of Tomorrow, did about as well as expected, which is to say it really struggled compared to its production budget. Overall, the box took in $163 million, which is 2% lower than last weekend. On the other hand, it is 9% higher than the same weekend last year, which is the far more important number. Year-to-date, 2014 has pulled in $4.38 billion, putting it 3.3% ahead of last year's pace of $4.24 billion. This is still a good margin and hopefully it will last.

On paper, Edge of Tomorrow is the obvious potential monster hit. It is a Sci-fi action film with a production budget that is nearly $200 million. The Fault in Our Stars is the obvious counter-programing. It is about two teen cancer patients who fall in love, which couldn't be farther away from a popcorn flick. However, the buzz really suggests The Fault in Our Stars could win. In fact, it could break the record for biggest opening for a romantic drama. This weekend last year, The Purge won with $34.06 million, while no other film earned more than $20 million. This year, three films might top $30 million and the winner could pull in more than $40 million. I think 2014 will win this weekend in the year-over-year competition. More..., 62799=It is Memorial Day long weekend and the box office is looking strong. X-Men: Days of Future Past should dominate the box office chart and there are some who think it will have the best opening of the year so far. Blended is playing the role of counter-programing this week and should do well in that role opening in third place. Meanwhile, the rest of the top five will be filled with Godzilla, Neighbors, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, all of which should still pull in $10 million or more.

Both films opened well and their respective studios should be happy, while the overall box office rose by 15% compared to last weekend hitting $187 million. Unfortunately, this is still 8% lower than this weekend last year. Had How to Train Your Dragon 2 matched higher expectations, 2014 would have won on the year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date, 2014 has earned $4.64 billion, putting it 3.0% ahead of 2013's pace of $4.50 billion, so this weekend's loss isn't a big deal. More..., 45767=June 17th, 2014, 55060=May 29th, 2014, 43400=June 25th, 2014, 66886=It has been a great year so far and April was again a strong month. The box office was led by Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as it became the second film of the year to reach $200 million, while Rio 2 is on pace to become the seventh $100 million hit of the year. Big picture, 2014 has already hit $3 billion, which isn't a record for this time of the year, but it is $250 million ahead of 2013. That streak ends in May. Don't get me wrong. There are six films opening this month that at least have a shot at $100 million and two of those should earn more than $200 million and there are two others that at least have a shot at that milestone. Leading the way is The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is looking to top The Winter Soldier and become the second biggest hit of the year so far. Its main competition this month is X-men: Days of Future Past, while Godzilla also has a shot at $200 million. Unfortunately, this month last year, Iron Man 3 earned more than $400 million, while two other films took in $200 million and seven films in total reached the century mark. That is going to be really hard to replicate this year and 2014 will likely lose some of its lead over 2013. Fortunately, 2014 has such a big lead that unless the box office really slumps, it will end the month with at least a small lead over 2013. More..., 62510=May 22nd, 2014, 53786=It was a mostly good weekend at the box office with Maleficent earning first place with nearly $70 million, which was on the very high end of expectations. On the other hand, A Million Ways to Die in the West failed to match the low end of expectations. Overall, the box office pulled in $165 million, which is 11% lower than last weekend. That's not bad for a post-holiday weekend. Compared to last year, the box office was higher, albeit by 0.6%, which is much lower than ticket price inflation. Considering I thought it would be worse than this, I'm calling a 0.6% increase a victory. Year-to-date, 2014 remains ahead of 2013, but by $133 million or 3.3% at $4.16 billion to $4.02 billion. If June is as bad as May, then 2014 could slip behind 2013 entirely. More..., 57299=May 28th, 2014, 42014=July 2nd, 2014, 47143=June 12th, 2014, 60847=May 27th, 2014, 53528=June 2nd, 2014, 44871=There were three films that were in a virtual tie for top spot on the international top ten. Godzilla squeaked out a win with $38.4 million in 62 markets for totals of $248.7 million internationally and $440.2 million worldwide after a month of release. This includes a $37.00 million opening weekend in China. Needless to say, it earned first place in that market. The film finishes its international run in Japan at the end of July and it should jump over $500 million worldwide when it does. More..., 51797=June 4th, 2014, 40150=November 26th, 2014, 50073=June 5th, 2014, 38712=July 13th, 2015, 61136=X-Men: Days of Future Past easily won the weekend race at the box office earning more than $100 million over the four-day weekend. That's great news and it helped the overall box office grow by 5% to $187 million over the three-day weekend from last week. That's the good news. The bad news the other new release, Blended, bombed and the three-day weekend was down 27% from the same weekend last year. In fact, this year's four-day weekend total of $231 million was 9% lower than last year's three-day total and 26% lower than the four-day weekend from last year. That's a devastating collapse. The only saving grace is last year was a record-breaking Memorial Day long weekend, so a sharp drop-off isn't that unexpected. So far, 2014 has pulled in $3.95 billion, which is 4% more than 2013's running tally of $3.80 billion. More..., 48818=As expected, The Fault in Our Stars won the box office race this past weekend, while its opening weekend was on the very high end of expectations. (It did so with a surprisingly strong opening Friday, but more on that later.) The other wide release of the week, Edge of Tomorrow, did about as well as expected, which is to say it really struggled compared to its production budget. Overall, the box took in $163 million, which is 2% lower than last weekend. On the other hand, it is 9% higher than the same weekend last year, which is the far more important number. Year-to-date, 2014 has pulled in $4.38 billion, putting it 3.3% ahead of last year's pace of $4.24 billion. This is still a good margin and hopefully it will last. More..., 48536=June 9th, 2014, 64434=May 16th, 2014, 66601=May 1st, 2014, 44609=June 18th, 2014, 50355=This weekend, there are two wide releases coming out, one of which is the obvious potential monster hit and the other being the obvious counter-programing. On paper, Edge of Tomorrow is the obvious potential monster hit. It is a Sci-fi action film with a production budget that is nearly $200 million. The Fault in Our Stars is the obvious counter-programing. It is about two teen cancer patients who fall in love, which couldn't be farther away from a popcorn flick. However, the buzz really suggests The Fault in Our Stars could win. In fact, it could break the record for biggest opening for a romantic drama. This weekend last year, The Purge won with $34.06 million, while no other film earned more than $20 million. This year, three films might top $30 million and the winner could pull in more than $40 million. I think 2014 will win this weekend in the year-over-year competition. More..., 62799=It is Memorial Day long weekend and the box office is looking strong. X-Men: Days of Future Past should dominate the box office chart and there are some who think it will have the best opening of the year so far. Blended is playing the role of counter-programing this week and should do well in that role opening in third place. Meanwhile, the rest of the top five will be filled with Godzilla, Neighbors, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, all of which should still pull in $10 million or more. By comparison, this weekend last year, there were six films that earned more than $10 million over the four-day weekend, led by Fast and Furious 6, which earned a four-day opening of $117.04 million There are some who think X-Men: Days of Future Past will top that figure. I really hope so. However, even if it does, last year was a record-breaking Memorial Day long weekend and I don't think 2014 will match it. More...}",,

This March could actually be even better, as there are three or four films that have a decent shot at earning $100 million or more. The top film will likely be Cinderella, which has a real shot at $200 million. Insurgent will almost assuredly get beyond the $100 million mark, while Get Hard, Home, and perhaps Chappie will also get to the century mark.

Alex and Lexie? Why does Grey's Anatomy feel the need to ruin a relationship when it's good? Lexie and Sloan were the perfect match and I think most fans would agree, and even if they don't end over this, this was just an unnecessary road block and really lame attempt at generating a cliffhanger. Can we stop with the Private PracticeÃ‚Â crossover episodes now? This is the 4th crossover story arc the two shows have done and Double P is only in its third season. That is just way too much.

Merle it turns out is still bitter at being abandoned for dead in Atlanta. ""We went back for you"" Glenn says, trying to explain to Merle that they had no plans of abandoning him. Merle isn't listening though, as he doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t believe a word of what Glenn is saying. Instead, he wants to know the whereabouts of Daryl as well as the rest of the group, so he can get to them. Glenn is fully aware of MerleÃ¢Â€Â™s intentions and therefore won't talk and gets beaten for it, as a result. Back at the prison, Rick is staring at Michonne, who has ""cloaked"" herself in zombie guts. .. Andrea As Laurie Holden (1)","Episode Quotes Merle: You don't even know why you're hear, do ya? I didn't mean you no harm, I lowered my gun, but you raised yours. You were an asshole out there, just like you were on that rooftop back in Atlanta. What y'all did, leaving me up there, people wouldn't do that to an animal. Glenn: We went back for you. Merle: Ain't you thoughtful. Rick: We can tend to that wound for you, give you a little food and water, and then send you on the way. But you're gonna have to tell us how you found us and why you were carrying formula. Michonne: The supplies were dropped by a young Asian guy with a pretty girl. Rick: What happened? Hershel: Were they attacked? Michonne: They were taken? Rick: Taken? By who? Michonne: By the same son of a bitch who shot me. Rick: Hey, these are our people. You tell us what happened now! Michonne: Don't you ever touch me again!

Examples of Named Sequences Table 2 provides some examples of Unicode named character sequences to illustrate the kinds of entities that have been formally named. The Ã¢Â€ÂœSequenceÃ¢Â€? column illustrates the entity in question with a representative rendering above the sequence of encoded Unicode characters that represent that entity. The Ã¢Â€ÂœNameÃ¢Â€? column shows the name that has been associated with that sequence. This annex defines the concept of a Unicode named character sequence, specifies a notational convention for such sequences, and a set of rules constraining possible names applied to character sequences. Section 5, Data Files, identifies the data file containing the normative list of Unicode named character sequences. As is the case for character names, named character sequences are strictly synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646. In some limited circumstances it is necessary to also provide a name for such sequences. The primary example is the need to have an identifier for a sequence to correlate with an identifier in another standard, for which a cross-mapping to Unicode is desired. To address this need, the Unicode Standard defines a mechanism for naming sequences and provides a short list of sequences that have been formally named. This list is deliberately selective: it is neither possible nor desirable to attempt to provide names for all possible sequences of Unicode characters that could be ofÃ‚Â  interest. 1.1 Named Character Sequences Such a conventional notation for sequences of Unicode code points","1.2 Relation to Variation Sequences Unicode named character sequences differ from Unicode variation sequences. The latter are documented in Section 16.4, Variation Selectors, in [Unicode] and are listed exhaustively in the data file StandardizedVariants.txt in the Unicode Character Database [UCD]. Variation sequences always consist of a sequence of precisely defined code points, the second of which must be a variation selector. There are additional constraints on which types of characters they can start with. Variation sequences have a restricted range of glyphic shapes, but have no associated name. Named character sequences can, in principle, consist of code point sequences of any length, without constraints on what types of characters are involved. They do not have a specifically defined glyphic shape, but they do have a formally specified name associated with them. 2 Definitions and Notation SD1Ã‚Â  Unicode named character sequence: A specific sequence of two or more Unicode characters, together with a formal name designating that sequence. The notation for a Unicode named character sequence consists of the general conventions for character sequences in Appendix A, Notational Conventions, of [Unicode], together with name conventions as specified in Section 4, Names. Thus a typical representation of a Unicode named character sequence would be <U+012B, U+0300> LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON AND GRAVE In contexts that supply other clear means for delimitation, such as data files or tables, the bracketing and comma",False,-1,0,"{25140=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2001-2009 Unicode, Inc.

Examples of Hypothetical Sequence Names Where possible, the names for sequences are constructed by appending the names of the constituent elements together while eliding duplicate elements, and possibly introducing the words between elements for clarity. Where this process would result in a name that already exists, the name is modified suitably to guarantee uniqueness. Table 3 gives some examples of names for hypothetical sequences constructed according in this manner. Names of Unicode named character sequences are unique. They are part of the same namespace as Unicode character names. As a result, where a name exists as a character name, a modified name must be assigned instead. The same applies to not-yet-encoded characters. 4 Names The use of a provisional list is meant to allow sufficient time for review and comment on proposed named character sequences before they are finally approved. This also enables the normative data file, NamedSequences.txt, to remain stable. Character sequences and proposed names listed in NamedSequencesProv.txt are provisional only and have no other status. They become part of the standard itself only when approved for inclusion in NamedSequences.txt. When named character sequences are first suggested for inclusion in the Unicode Standard, they may be accepted provisionally. In such cases, they are listed in the file NamedSequencesProv.txt. See [DataProv]. 3.1 Provisional Process for Named Character Sequences The use of unnamed sequences is not affected by the specifications in this annex. Conformance","Where names are constructed other than by merging existing character names for the constituent characters of the sequence, convention restricts any additional items to the Latin capital letters A to Z, SPACE, HYPHEN-MINUS, and the digits 0 to 9, provided that a digit is not the first character in a word. This convention makes it possible to turn names into identifiers using straightforward transformations. Names for named sequences are constructed according to the following rules: R1: Only Latin capital letters A to Z, digits 0 to 9 (provided that a digit is not the first character in a word), SPACE, and HYPHEN-MINUS are used for writing the names. R2:Ã‚Â  Only one name is given to each named sequence, and each named sequence must have a unique name within the namespace that named sequences share with character names. R3:Ã‚Â  Like character names, names for sequences are unique if they are different even when SPACE and medial HYPHEN-MINUS characters are ignored, and when the strings Ã¢Â€ÂœLETTERÃ¢Â€?, Ã¢Â€ÂœCHARACTERÃ¢Â€?, and Ã¢Â€ÂœDIGITÃ¢Â€? are ignored in comparison of the names. The following two character names are exceptions to this rule, because they were created before this rule was specified: 116C HANGUL JUNGSEONG OE 1180 HANGUL JUNGSEONG O-E Examples of unacceptable names that are not unique: SARATI LETTER AA SARATI CHARACTER AA These two names would not be unique if the strings Ã¢Â€ÂœLETTERÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœCHARACTERÃ¢Â€? were ignored.

The auditing committee were Nicholas Shapleigh, Edward Rishworth, Samuel Wheelwright., 14592=During August of 1676, Capt. Scottow was evidently at Boston, leaving the conduct of affairs to Jocelyn and Tippen with Walter Gendal as a third on the ""committee of the militia."" Sergeant Tippen, who appears to have been a very efficient officer, being called away also, the others found themselves unable to control the inhabitants who were acting as garrison soldiers, and they wrote this letter to Capt. Scottow:, 4885=Mr. Foxwell also deposed against Capt. Scottow's inhumanity in the affair of the burning of Dunstan, etc. Walter Gendall, who served as Sergeant under Capt. Scottow, and had charge of a body of soldiers at Spurwink in 1675, made a similar deposition., 6016=The humble Petition of the Inhabitants of Scarborough. Whereas Mr. Scottow of Boston Stood by us in all our streights and distresses during the late Warr with the Indians and not only encouraged us with his presence from April until January last, but alsoe releived us with a barrell of powder and all sorts of ammunition as it cost him in Boston near to twenty pounds for which he is not yet paid, yea, then when as there was no town Stock nor a pound of powder in the Town that we know of without which supply we and our familyes must either have been destroyed or our town deserted as Casco and Saco were, we being then for divers months the seat of war and having more houses than one of the Townes and above double the other burnt and consumed:, 15543=Yr friends to serve you Black Point, Aug. 9th, 1676. HENRY JOCELYN, WALTER GENDALL., 15646=The Blackpoint garrison was recognized by the Indians as the strongest fortification in the Eastern Towns, and it had therefore escaped any assault in the general destruction which fell upon Casco and the Kennebec towns. In the letter of Capt. Hathorne in the last chapter, we find some account of the discontent of the people at Blackpoint and their determination to abandon the garrison and betake themselves to the safer towns to the West. The letter indicates also that Capt. Scottow was there when Capt. Hathorne visited the place, but evidently withdrew soon after; as upon October 12th the Indians appeared at the garrison, a hundred strong, with the chief ""Mugg"" (or Mog Hegon, Whittier's Mog Megone) at their head; they found the inhabitants all within the fort and Mr. Jocelyn in command., 13194=Blackpoint, July ye 15th 1676, 3801=A note of Mr. Drake's in his edition (1865) of Mr. Hubbard's history, cites original papers, then in his possession, as testimony against Capt. Scottow. The deposition of Michael Edgecombe, aged about 25 years, declares that he was at Blackpoint when the ""nine Winter-harbour men were fighting the Indians upon the Sands opposite said Place, and saw sundrie men come to Mr. Scottow importuning that he would send some Ayde over to those poore distressed men,"" etc., and that Capt. Scottow, though seeing the English were far outnumbered by the Indians, and must be overcome soon without releif, yet would not suffer a man to go to help them; and one John Lux came and reproached the Captain and offered to take men in his shallop across the river and land them ""on shoare in Little River,"" near where the men were fighting, and where all were found slain next day. This was sworn to before Brian Pendleton, July 20th, 1676. Lux declared that nothing would move Capt. Scottow, although he could see the men being overpowered by greatly outnumbering savages., 10366=These are to testifie before whom it may concern, that Mr. Scottow of Boston, being wth us when (???) ye men were killed upon Sacho Sands at the first heering of the guns fired there wth consent of Mr. Josselin gave ye Alarum all over garrison to ye whole town, drew up such of us on our armes as were at home, dispatcht our Corporall to call in such as were abroad, as also the said Scottow was very Angry with Mackshawine for saying that Captaine Wincoll and his Company were all cut off, telling him though some might be killed and the rest ffled yett it might be to gain ye advantage of ground as it proved, as also at the same time Scottow seartcht the armes and ammunition of us which were drawne up exchanging ye armes which were insufficient for his owne ffixed armes, and that hee supplied every man of all those that were sent forth, and wanted, both with powder, buletts, swan shott, biskett, and a dram of ye bottle out of his owne store, there not being at the same time one pound of powder in ye town, that wee know of but what they recved from Scottow & that the said Scottow, upon the first alarum enquire whether some of us might not bee sent in a shallop or in Canows to goe to ye releif of those men, it was answered that they could not be sent with safety neither for the men nor for their armes because of the gulf of ye sea, the wind blowing ffresh upon the shore.

Scottow (for aught doth appeare) hath faithfully dischardged his trust, and is therefore acquitted from the chardge endeavord to be put on him, but that the same be borne by the county and that Mr. Rushworth do pay Capt.

IPTi is a promising intervention to reduce malaria in infants in malaria endemic countries. 3 doses of antimalarial drugs are given in the first year of life to asymptomatic infants at the time of 2nd and 3rd Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertusus immunisation and again at 9 months of age at time of measles immunisation. In the current Kilimanjaro IPTi study we are comparing 3 antimalarials (Mefloquine MQ, sulfadoxine/pyremethamine SP and chlorproguanil/dapsone CD) against placebo for IPTi in 2 transmission zones. Two published studies using SP for IPTi have shown different efficacies for this intervention. The first study (Schellenberg et al 2001) showed a 62% reduction in clinical cases of malaria and the second (Chandramohan et al, 2005) showed only a 25% reduction in clinical cases of malaria. The two sites differ in several ways, the first was carried out in an area of moderate to low transmission with a moderate rate of SP resistance in Tanzania and the latter was carried out in an area of intense but seasonal malaria with a low rate of SP resistance in Ghana. The current IPTi study",False,-1,0,"{23026=It is expected that first line antimalarial drug policy will change in November 2006 from SP to lumefantrine/arthemeter.

Therefore we plan to carry out the SP efficacy in 6-59 month study in symptomatic children as soon as possible and if the national policy changes before completion of the study we will have to halt it.

In HIV-infected patients with KS in developed settings, the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with regression of the tumor, in many but not all cases, even in the absence of conventional chemotherapy. However, it is not known which specific antiretroviral drugs or regimens are critical to convey HAART's anti-KS effect. In particular, it is not known whether the anti-KS effects of protease inhibitors (PI) in vitro and in animal models translate into improved clinical outcomes as compared to non-PI-based HAART regimens. To address this, we will determine whether a PI-based HAART regimen (lopinavir/ritonavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir) is superior to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based HAART regimen (efavirenz plus emtricitabine/tenofovir) in promoting the regression of KS tumor burden in persons with AIDS-related KS in sub-Saharan Africa. We will enroll 224 patients with AIDS-related KS in Kampala, Uganda, randomly assign them to either a PI-based HAART or an NNRTI-based HAART regimen, and observe them for one year to determine the response in their KS to therapy.

I was in this race that I didn't even realise that I was in. I woke up and ten years had passed. That was never my plan"". She subsequently took a hiatus from music.[4], 25916=""Not in Love"", Kelis's collaboration with Enrique Iglesias from his 2003 album 7, was released as a single the following year, reaching the UK top five.[10] Although the single failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, it topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. Also in 2004, Kelis collaborated with BjÃƒÂ¶rk on a remix of the latter's track ""Oceania"" (from BjÃƒÂ¶rk's album MedÃƒÂºlla), which appeared as a B-side to the BjÃƒÂ¶rk album's second single, ""Who Is It"". Kelis toured as the opening act for fellow Jive artist Britney Spears's The Onyx Hotel Tour. In 2005, she was featured on the soundtrack to the film Just Like Heaven with a cover version of The Pretenders' ""Brass in Pocket"" (1979),, 41904=During mid-2010, Kelis embarked on her first U.S. tour, titled All Hearts with Robyn,[31] amid a selection of club, festival and solo dates that continued through 2011Ã¢Â€Â“these included Glastonbury, The Big Chill, Good Vibrations and Lovebox. Kelis appears on the Mark Ronson-produced track ""The Man Who Stole a Leopard"" from the 2010 Duran Duran release All You Need Is Now, and co-wrote the song ""Waiting"" for British pop singer Cheryl Cole's Messy Little Raindrops., 3193=Kelis Rogers Mora (/kÃ‰Â™.Ã‹ÂˆliÃ‹?s/;[2] born August 21, 1979) (nÃƒÂ©e Rogers),[3] better known mononymously as Kelis, is an American singer-songwriter and certified chef. Kelis achieved moderate international success with her 1999 debut album, Kaleidoscope, but left her label Virgin Records after its follow-up, Wanderland (2001), received little sales attention and no U.S. release. Her third album, 2003's Tasty, earned the singer commercial prominence and produced the hit single ""Milkshake"", her most well-known song. Kelis Was Here (2006), her fourth album, was the subject of further label disputes and she took a hiatus from music after its release, during which she trained at Le Cordon Bleu culinary school. She released the album Flesh Tone in 2010 and her sixth, Food, independently in 2014., 15382=The album performed better in Europe, where ""Caught out There"" was a moderate hit and reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, ""Good Stuff"" (featuring Terrar of Clipse), reached number 19; the third, ""Get Along with You"", was less successful, reaching number 51.[10] The British Phonographic Industry certified Kaleidoscope gold for sales of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom,[11] where it reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2001, Kelis won the BRIT Award for International Breakthrough Act and the NME Award for Best R&B/Soul Act, before joining Moby and U2 on their Area:One and Elevation tours, respectively. Kelis and the Neptunes' output at this time was heralded as foreshadowing an innovation in contemporary R&B, but she later said, ""I was never an R&B artist. People coined me one but that's because, especially if you're in the States, if you're black and you sing, then you're R&B"".[4] Her colorful style in both clothing and hair received considerable attention.[citation needed], 28783=Kelis's fourth studio album, Kelis Was Here, was released in August 2006, and debuted and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200. Despite the career-high debut, the album has sold only 157,000 copies in the United States as of 2007, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[8][18] Its lead single, ""Bossy"" (featuring Too Short), achieved frequent airplay on urban radio and was a moderate hit in the U.S., peaking at number 16.[8] ""Bossy"" went multi-platinum as a mobile phone ringtone, according to the RIAA.[17] The album includes production credits by Scott Storch, Cee-Lo Green (from the Gnarls Barkley fame), Max Martin, Dr. Luke, Raphael Saadiq, will.i.am, Knobody, Polow da Don, Damon Elliott, Cool and Dre, Sean Garrett, and Bangladesh. Unlike on Kelis's previous albums, the production duo The Neptunes are not featured at all; Kelis was quoted as saying that it was ""very important to me"", but also that it was purely a creative decision and that she has no ill will toward Williams or Hugo.[citation needed] Kelis Was Here was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 2007 Grammy Awards., 49394=Kelis's performance at London's Somerset House was recorded and released as an album, Live in London, in November 2014.[47] The following month she was featured on house producer Breach's single ""The Key"", a reworking of his remix of Kelis's Food track ""Rumble"".[48], 45301=In a 2011 interview, Kelis said that her sixth studio album would be finished ""in the next few weeks"".[34] According to Kelis's management firm at the time, Three Six Zero Group, the album was to feature production from Skream, BURNS, Tom Neville, Dan Black, and Caspa.[35] She said of the album, ""I've been on a real 1990s vibe with this record, it's kind of trip-hoppish [...] it's more electro, it's a little deeper and darker"".[36] The Skream-produced single ""Distance"" received its UK radio premiere in mid 2012,[37] although the rest of the material from these recording sessions remains unreleased.[38] Kelis was featured on Dan Black's single ""Hearts""[39] and Skream's ""Copy Cat"" (both 2013), the latter of which led to a dispute after Kelis alleged that Skream refused to have her appear in the music video.[40], 40279=The first single from Flesh Tone, ""Acapella"" (produced by David Guetta), debuted in the top five on the UK Singles Chart[10] and reached number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs and the UK Dance Chart. Flesh Tone was released in May 2010 in Europe and Asia, and in July in the U.S., where it peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200 and at number five on the Dance/Electronic Albums.[8] The second single, ""4th of July (Fireworks)"", was accompanied by a video co-directed by Kelis herself (with John ""Rankin"" Waddell and Nicole Ehrlich), and became a club hit in America and Britain. Subsequent singles ""Scream"" and ""Brave"" made minimal chart impact., 17890=Kelis's second album, Wanderland, was released in 2001 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, but did not receive a North American release. According to Kelis, her U.S. record company at the time, Virgin, had laid off those that worked on Kaleidoscope; their replacements did not understand or believe in Wanderland, which led her to leave the label around the time of the album's European release.[12][13] A commercial failure,[14] Wanderland peaked at number 78 in the UK, although its sole single release, ""Young, Fresh n' New"", was a top forty entry on the UK Singles Chart.[10] The album, which was produced in its entirety by the Neptunes and features collaborations with members of Clipse and No Doubt, was well received by publications such as The Guardian and NME.[15][16], 50425=Between 2006 and 2010, Kelis trained part-time as a saucier, eventually graduating from Le Cordon Bleu culinary school.[4][49] During 2006, Kelis wrote a cookbook with Lauren Pesavento[50] and designed her own line of fashion accessories, called Cake.[51] In 2007, she was in talks to host a Project Runway-esque show for VH1 and auditioned for various film and TV roles.[18][26], 38002=In 2009, Kelis announced that she was finishing her fifth studio album, to be released in 2010 under Interscope Records via the will.i.am Music Group. Kelis worked with various producers and contributors on the album, titled Flesh Tone, including Ammo, Jean Baptiste, Benny Benassi, Burns, Diplo, Boys Noize, Free School, DJ Switch, will.i.am, and David Guetta. The album marked Kelis' transition into dance and pop music, away from her previous R&B-based material.[28] Coinciding with her change in musical direction, Kelis appeared on Basement Jaxx's 2009 album Scars on the title track, on Benassi's 2010 single ""Spaceship"" with apl.de.ap and Jean Baptiste, and on the Crookers single ""No Security"" from their debut album Tons of Friends.[29][30], 36927=After Kelis left Jive, the label released a fourteen-track greatest hits album entitled The Hits in March 2008. The album does not contain any previously unreleased songs; Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Got Your Money"", N.E.R.D's ""Truth or Dare"", and Richard X's ""Finest Dreams"" appear on the album alongside every charted Kelis single to that date, with the exception of ""Blindfold Me""., 13735=Kelis began recording her debut album, Kaleidoscope, in mid-1998 and was finished within a year. Produced by The Neptunes and released by Virgin Records in 1999, the album peaked at number 144 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and reached the top five on the Top Heatseekers chart.[8] As of 2006, the album had sold 249,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[9] Its lead and most notable single, ""Caught Out There"", became a top ten Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs hit and peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100.[8] During this time, Kelis featured on Ol' Dirty Bastard's U.S. top 40 single ""Got Your Money""., 51726=In 2013, Kelis debuted her sauce line, ""Feast"", at the Beverly Hills Food & Wine Festival.[52] The line went on general sale in 2015 under the new name of ""Bounty & Full"".[53] Kelis has described sauce as ""what accessories are to a womanÃ¢Â€Â™s outfit. Sauce defines where the dish is from and whoÃ¢Â€Â™s making it [...] I think everything is better smothered, poured, or dipped.""[54] In 2014, the Cooking Channel aired a cooking TV series starring Kelis, Saucy and Sweet, and the same year she set up a food truck to cook for attendees of the American music festival SXSW.[55][56] Her first cookbook, My Life on a Plate, is scheduled for release in 2015; Kelis describes it as ""an exploration of tastes and cultures, and my experience as a chef, musician, mother and wife"".[57], 19735=In 2002, Kelis recorded ""So Be It"" for the Red Hot Organization's Fela Kuti tribute CD, Red Hot and Riot, from which all proceeds were donated to AIDS awareness charities. The same year, she had a top 20 US club hit with a remix of ""Young, Fresh 'n' New"" remix produced by Timo Maas, who subsequently featured Kelis on his single ""Help Me"".[8][10], 28093=Kelis contributed a track titled ""80's Joint"" to the soundtrack of the 2006 dance film Step Up. She collaborated with Busta Rhymes and will.i.am on the track ""I Love My Bitch"", the second single from Rhymes's 2006 album The Big Bang. This was the second time Kelis teamed up with Rhymes, the first being his 2001 song ""What It Is""., 54755=In March 2007, Kelis was detained by police in Miami Beach, Florida, and charged with disorderly conduct. The arrest report said the officers were posing as prostitutes along a main avenue in the South Beach nightclub district when Kelis started screaming racial profanities at them. She was sent to Miami-Dade County Jail, and was later released on a $1,500 bond.[63] In September 2008, Kelis was acquitted on charges of resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct stemming back to the 2007 arrest. A spokesman for Kelis further commented that the artist would still be moving forward with a lawsuit against the Miami Beach Police, claiming unlawful arrest and the violation of her civil rights.[64], 53602=Nasir Jones and Kelis met at an MTV Video Music Awards party in 2002; they dated for one year before becoming engaged in 2004, and marrying in January 2005. In April 2009 she filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She was seven months pregnant at the time.[58] On July 22, 2009, Kelis gave birth to a baby boy named Knight.[59] The birth was announced by Nas via an online video.[60] The same month, a judge in New York City ordered Nas to pay Kelis $55,000 per month in child and spousal support.[61] The couple's divorce was finalized in May 2010.[62], 47206=In 2013, following reports that Kelis had been working with producer Dave Sitek, it was announced that she had signed to Sitek's own record label Federal Prism and was going to release two albums.[40][41][42] A new single, ""Jerk Ribs"" premiered online the same month.[43] In late 2013, it was announced that Kelis had signed to British independent label Ninja Tune for the release of the album, titled Food, in April 2014.[44] Food is produced entirely by Sitek and contains influences of soul, funk, gospel, and AfrobeatÃ¢Â€Â”Kelis said of the album, ""You know, those records in your life that your parents played and they resonate with who you are? They make you nostalgic. I wanted to find out how to get that feeling.""[45] Food entered the UK Albums Chart at number 20, becoming Kelis's second highest peaking album after Tasty in 2004.[46] In the U.S., it reached number 73 on the Billboard 200.[8], 20965=In 2003, Kelis achieved a second top ten hit in the UK as a featured artist on Richard X's ""Finest Dreams"",[10] a reworking of the S.O.S. Band's 1986 single ""The Finest"". She found mainstream success in the U.S. later that year, with her Hot Dance Club Play number-one, Billboard Hot 100 top three single, ""Milkshake""; this helped to propel her third album, Tasty, to gold status in the U.S., where it peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 and has sold 533,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[8][17][18] ""Milkshake"" also went gold, selling over 500,000 copies,[17] and earned Kelis a Grammy Award nomination in 2004 for Best Urban/Alternative Performance.

In the UK, Kelis Was Here charted at number 41 and has sold 60,000 copies, earning a silver certification from the BPI.[10][23] In Australia, the album reached number 96 on the ARIA Albums Chart and the track ""I Don't Think So"" was used in promotion for the 2008 season of the reality series Big Brother Australia.[24] The song subsequently peaked at number 27 on the ARIA chart and became a top ten urban hit. During mid 2007, Kelis toured in Europe, appearing in numerous festivals across the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, such as Wireless, Rise and Gurtenfestival.

A church was built the same year. After the minister left in 1816, this congregation became extinct and the church passed into the hands of a Wesleyan Methodist congregation, who occupied it about five years. It was then purchased by a congregation in connection with the Original Associate Burgher Synod. In 1839, this congregation joined the Established church, along with the majority of the Synod, then withdrew at the Disruption in 1843 and became a Free Church. A new church was built in 1867.

A church was built the same year. After the minister left in 1816, this congregation became extinct and the church passed into the hands of a Wesleyan Methodist congregation, who occupied it about five years. It was then purchased by a congregation in connection with the Original Associate Burgher Synod. In 1839, this congregation joined the Established church, along with the majority of the Synod, then withdrew at the Disruption in 1843 and became a Free Church. A new church was built in 1867.

Kalau Musa membelah lautan maka Muhammad tidak tanggung2 yang di belahnya adalah Bulan! JANGAN BERANI MUNGKIR! Seluruh dunia mencatat Mukjizat ini. Nah dari konteks di atas apa maksud dari kata: SEPERTI ENGKAU INI dalam ayat tersebut? apa menurutmu arti dari kata (seperti engkau ini) bisa di sandingkan dengan karakter Isa Alaihissalam yang berdakwah penuh dengan kasih? Bukankah karakteristik Musa dan Muhammad ada sinkronisasi di antara keduanya? 4. Nabi Musa sama dan seperti nabi Muhammad, keduanya berjuang, berdakwah, bertempur melawan musuhnya, awal mulanya mereka di tolak, namun setelah itu di terima dan berjaya . Sementara kalau Yesus ,ia tidak terjuang dalam medan pertempuran dan misi dakwahnya pun di tolak oleh kaumnya, Yesus di tolak oleh umatnya sendiri, umat Yahudi dan mereka berniat mau menyalib dan membunuhnya ,Ã¢Â€Â¦!!! Musa dan Muhammad sama-sama menumpahkan darah orang lain, itu tepatÃ¢Â€Â¦ YESUS malah menumpahkan darahNYA sendiri untuk orang lain (dalam hal ini Musa juga telah menumpahkan harga dirinya demi unek-unek sebangsanya sendiri). 3.

Oleh sebab itu anda sebagai seorang terpelajar seharusnya mempunyai wawasan yang luas akan hal ini. Mampukah anda mencerna dengan benar bahwa 1+1+1=3. Nah agama islam itu mengajarkan hal-hal yang seperti itu, sebab seluruh manusia mengetahui bahwa hasil 3 adalah benar. Tidak ada Ilmu Pengetahuan di dunia ini yang akan membantah apa yang saya katakan tentang penambahan tersebut. Kalau anda mengatakan bahwa 1+1+1=1, anda harus membuktikannya? Sayapun merasa tidak ada Ilmu Pengetahuan yang mampu menterjemahkan hasil tersebut. Hasilnya saja sudah rumit apa lagi dogmanya. Jadi apapun yang anda jabarkan hal itu tidak akan memberikan hasil. Anak kecil saja akan menertawakan anda kalau penjumlahan anda seperti itu. Sudahlah dari segi ilmu anda salah, dari dogmapun anda tidak tahu. Dalam dogma anda bahwa yang menciptakan Langit dan Bumi adalah Yesus. Ilmu pengetahuan mengatakan bahwa umur dunia ini sudah hampir 13,8 Milyar tahun, sedangkan Yesus kamu di lahirkan 2000 tahun yang lalu. Kalau saya katakan bahwa perkataanmu yang tidak konsisten itu baru tepat. Satu lagi dogma anda bahwa Yesus bangkit dan naik ke syurga. Mengapa yesus anda tidak berpesan pada orang2 dan para muridnya bahwa dosa manusia sudah di tebus dan saya akan naik kelangit. Dari mana anda mengetahui bahwa dia tugasnya adalah menebus dosa dan dia naik kelangit? Naik ke langit dalam rangka apa dan mengapa harus di syurga? Kalau demikian mengapa dia tidak menyudahi kehidupan dunia ini toh dosa manusia sudah di tebus? Menurut saya kepercayaan anda tidak memberikan bukti apapun untuk di jadikan pegangan! Masalah percaya dan tidak percaya sama Yesus naik kelangit tidak ada relevansinya dengan penduduk kota Yerussalem. Saya mengatakan kepada anda bahwa mengapa Yesus naik kelangit tidak di saksikan oleh seluruh penduduk kota tersebut. Mengapa hanya orang2 tertentu saja yang anda katakan. Saya mendalami dan mengetahui Ilmu Perencanaan yang namanya Kota apa bila penduduknya di atas 10.000 jiwa. Apakah penduduk Yerussalem hanya 500 orang saja. Apa sangkut pautnya orang yang percaya dan tidak percaya dengan naiknya Yesus ke langit? Itu artinya ada 9500 orang lebih yang tidak percaya sama Yesus namun setidak-tidaknya mereka bisa menjadi saksi bahwa Yesus naik ke langit, bukan? Kalau saya umpamakan begini: Saya sampai kapanpun tidak akan pernah percaya bahwa ada seekor kuda pandai bicara dan di lain waktu kuda tersebut terbang di saksikan sendiri oleh penduduk kota termasuk saya, itu lain soal. Terbangnya kuda tidak akan pernah menjawab kepercayaan saya bahwa dia pandai bicara. Yang lainnya tidak saya bahas lagi sebab bagi saya sudah cukup untuk ini saja dahulu, mengenai hari kiamat dan siapa Dajjal, kalau anda berminat akan saya kopas. Jika Anda mengakui Injil Barnabas sebagai Injil yang benar, maka yang paling bermasalah adalah Islam dan bukan Kristen,Ã¢Â€Â¦ itu yang seharusnya Anda pikirkanÃ¢Â€Â¦, 37954=Comment by fanyaÃ¢Â€Â” Februari 10, 2011 #, 668634=Comment by parhobassÃ¢Â€Â” Januari 17, 2011 #, 557488=Sepertinya saya sudah menjawab, tergantung dari sisi mana melihatnya. Dari sisi agama saya, jawabnya : mengenali dari fitrah diri saya sendiri dan menggunakan instrument-nya berupa risalah yang di bawa Rasul ( perlu anda tahu definisi Rasul menurut Islam dan Kristian adalah berbeda, Rasul = pembawa/penyampai ). Rasul-2 pembawa risalah yang sudah ada sejak zaman Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim(Abraham), Musa, Isa (Yeshua, Iesous), hingga Muhammad, dimana semuanya mengajarkan monotheisme murni kepada Tuhan yang Esa. Tuhan Yang Esa yang tidak dibatasi waktu, tempat dan zaman, tidak seperti nama yang anda tuhan-kan tersebut. Seandainya mesin waktu manusia bisa diciptakan, manusia akan mengenal Tuhan yang sama dimanapun dia berada sebagai Sang Pencipta, dengan tidak mempermasalahkan lagi di zaman sebelum Masehi punya dosa waris yang sudah ditebus atau belum, di Era Masehi punya dosa waris sudah yang ditebus atau belumÃ¢Â€Â¦ Orang yang tidak pernah mengenal Yeshua juga tidak tahu, apakah dosanya sudah ditebus atau belum. Jika hukum lama sudah digantikan dengan hukum baru, orang wajib mengikuti hukum yang baru. Begitu juga ajaran yang lama mesti ditinggalkan, dan mengikuti ajaran penggenapnya. Jadi sekali lagi perlu ditekankan, konsep dosa asal adalah ciptaan Paulus, dan Yeshua tidak pernah menyampaikan hal itu dalam bible. Sungguh menyedihkan, manusia dilahirkan di dunia sebagai pendosa, padahal sebenarnya dia adalah khalifah, wakil Tuhan sebagai penguasa alam., 282134=Mencermati atas statemen anda dengan balasan saya sebagai berikut; Mengapa anda memasukkan Injil Barnabas kedalam golongan Injil terlarang? Sementara Injil yang lain anda beriman padanya? Mengapa Injil Barnabas itu harus ada di muka bumi ini? Anda menuduh saya meremehkan Allah dan Rasulnya dengan mempercayai Injil Barnabas, anda lupa salah satu dari Rukun Iman dalam Islam adalah, Beriman dengan kitab2Nya, yaitu Zabur, Taurat, Injil dan Al Quran. Allah Maha Suci, itu artinya bukan berarti anda mampu mengukur Kesucian Allah dengan akal manusia yang rendah seperti ini. Kesucian Allah tidak bisa di ukur dengan bentuk kesucian apapun di dunia ini dan tidak pula bisa di terjemahkan dengan kata-kata manusia. Allah Maha Suci bukan berarti suci dalam pikiran manusia. Dengan perkataan para malaikatNya dan Nabinya kita bisa memahami sebagian kecil dari arti dan maksud Maha Suci; Perkataan Para Malaikat: 2:32. Mereka menjawab: Ã¢Â€ÂœMaha Suci Engkau, tidak ada yang kami ketahui selain dari apa yang telah Engkau ajarkan kepada kami; sesungguhnya Engkaulah Yang Maha Mengetahui lagi Maha Bijaksana., 195396=Comment by fanyaÃ¢Â€Â” Februari 2, 2011 #, 539917=Comment by Filar BiruÃ¢Â€Â” Januari 21, 2011 #, 481172=. . @ Triadi Mengakui maupun tidak mengakui adanya Kristus, dosa kutuk semua manusia sudah ditebus secara percuma.

Kenyataan setelah Nabi Muhammad SAW ada manusia yang mengaku nabi, Saya menjelaskan kepada anda dengan kalimat di atas BAHWA TIDAK ADA NABI YANG DI UTUS TUHAN SETELAH NABI MUHAMMAD SAW. Apa kamu tidak mengerti dengan kalimat saya yang sederhana di atas? Kamu mengatakan bahwa banyak manusia mengaku nabi! Apakah MENGAKU-NGAKU SAMA DENGAN DI UTUS ATAU UTUSAN TUHAN? Salah satu pesan nabi di dalam sebuah hadits mengatakan bahwa akan ada manusia yang mengaku nabi setelah aku, jumlahnya 30 orang.

Ingat bahasa Arab tidak tunggal, tetapi ditunggal di dalam AQ dari lafas QuraisyÃ¢Â€Â¦. sehingga kalau ada perkataan yang sedikti berbeda akan diterangkan dalam ukuran QuraisyÃ¢Â€Â¦ dan keterangan itu adalah footnotesÃ¢Â€Â¦ kenapa butuh footnotes, tak lain tak bukan karena pada masa itu tidak semua orang Arab mengerti lafas quraisyÃ¢Â€Â¦ Ketika terjadi perang Armenia dan Azarbaijan dengan penduduk Iraq, di antara orang yang ikut dalam peperangan itu adalah Hudzaifah bin Al Yaman, ia banyak melihat perbedaan dalam cara membaca Al Quran. Sebagaian bacaan itu bercampur dengan kesalahan tapi masing2 pihak mempertahankan dan berpegang teguh dengan bacaannya serta menantang orang setiap orang yang menyalahi bacaannya dan bahkan saling mengkafirkan sebagian dari yang lain. Melihat kenyataan ini Hudzaifah segera menghadap Utsman dan melaporkan apa yang di lihatnya. Mendengar laporan ini Utsman mengambil sikap tegas, yaitu mengumpulkan para sahabat termasuk Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari seorang yang pernah membacakan Al Quran untuk terakhir kalinya di hadapan Nabi. Sebelum nabi wafat. Utsman mengatakan kepada Hudzaifah bahwa apa yang di lihat Hudzaifah akan terjadi pula dengan berbagai generasi, apa lagi tempat mereka berada jauh dari tempat turunnya Al Quran. Maka Utsman mengirim seorang utusan ke rumah Hafsah untuk meminjam Mushaf Abu Bakar. Perlu anda ketahui tokoh di balik pengumpulan Al Quran ini adalah Umar Al Khattab Al Faruq ra. Atas ide beliaulah Al Quran itu terkumpul berkat Rahmat Allah. Latar belakang dari ide Umar ini adalah ketika perang Yamamah pecah di zaman pemerintahan Abu Bakar ra. pada tahun 12H. yang melibatkan sejumlah para sahabat yang hafal Al Quran. Dan dalam peperangan ini 70 para sahabat meninggal dunia. Melihat kenyataan ini Umar sangat khawatir dan menghadap Abu Bakar ra, dan mengajukan usulan dan pembukuan Al Quran. Akan tetapi Abu Bakar keberatan atas usulan Umar ini. Tetapi Umar tetap membujuk Abu Bakar, sehinggan Allah membukakan pintu hatinya. Dan pada akhirnya usulan Umar itu di terimah dengan baik oleh Abu Bakar. Kemudian Abu Bakar memerintahkan Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari untuk mengumpulkan Al Quran, mengingat kedudukannya dalam Qiraat, penulisan, pemahaman dan kecerdasan beliau tidak di ragukan lagi. Setelah di bujuk oleh Abu Bakar dan Umar akhirnya Zaid menerima usulan tersebut setelah Allah membukakan kelapangan dada di hatinya. Sebelumnya Zaid pernah berkata kepada kedua orang ini dengan ucapannya yang sangat terkenal, semoga Allah meninggikan kedudukannya di Akhirat, Amin: Ã¢Â€ÂœDemi Allah sekiranya mereka meminta padaku untuk memindahkan gunung maka tidak akan berat bagiku, dari pada perintah untuk mengumpulkan Al QuranÃ¢Â€?. Setelah Al Quran itu terkumpul dengan tingkat ketelitian tinggi dan cermat, maka Mushaf tersebut di simpan oleh Abu Bakar. Setelah Abu bakar meninggal Mushaf ini di simpan oleh Umar dan ketika Umar wafat maka putrinya yang menyimpan Mushaf ini yaitu Hafsah. Itulah sebabnya Utsman mengutus seseorang ke rumah Hafsah untuk meminjam Mushaf Abu Bakar untuk di salin sebayak 7 eksemplar dan di kirim kenegeri2. Sedangkan Mushaf yang asli di kembalikan ke Hafsah. Di dalam sebuah forum Utsman memanggil Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari, Abdulah bin Zubair, Said bin As dan Abdurahman bin Haris bin Hisyam. Orang2 ini di perintah oleh Utsman untuk menyalin Al Quran yang mereka datangi dari rumah Umar yang di simpan oleh Hafsah. Setelah mereka selesai menyalin Mushaf itu maka Utsman memerintahkan kepada mereka agar mengirimnya ke enam tempat dan satu di Madinah. Dan Utsman memerintahkan kepada mereka untuk membakar dialeg Al Quran selain dari yang baru saja mereka salin. Ada tujuh buah Qiraat di dalam penulisan Al Quran ini pada masa itu, antara qiraat yang satu dengan qiraat yang lain berbeda, baik di dalam pengucapan dan penulisan. Qiraat yang tersebar itu mempunyai guru2 agama tersendiri tersendiri, sedangkan yang di ajarkan oleh guru2 qiraat adalah anak2, anak2 akan tumbuh menjadi dewasa, apa bila bertemu antara satu orang dengan orang yang lain maka tentu satu qiraat berbeda dengan satu qiraat yang lain, tidak saja pertengkaran yang akan timbul, perang bisa pecah jadinya. Akibat memiliki cara pandang seperti inilah Utsman memerintahkan untuk membakar qiraat-qiraat yang lain selain dari qiraat yang baru saja mereka salin. Dan qiraat yang mereka salin tersebut adalah qiraat dengan bahasa Quraisy. Jadi tujuan Utsman membakar qiraat yang lain adalah untuk menyatukan umat dalam satu QIRAAT. Yaitu Qiraat yang di kumpulkan oleh Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari pada masa pemerintahan Abu Bakar. Nah Mushaf Abu Bakar inilah yang sebenarnya yang di baca oleh penduduk dunia saat ini yang beragama islam.

Akhirnya Nabi palsu ini tidak lama bertahan di muka bumi ini pada tahun 11 H, ia tewas di bunuh oleh Khalid bin Walid pada masa pemerintahan Abu Bakar Siddik. Lalu muncul pula Aswad al Insi dari Yaman mengaku jadi Nabi, dengan keahliannya sebagai penyair dan seorang dukun, akhirnya Nabi pembohong ini pun mati sehari sebelum wafatnya Rasulullah Saw. Berikutnya muncul pula, Mukhtar bin Abi Ubeid mengaku telah dapat wahyu dari Allah Swt., beliau dari keturunan Bani Saqif, lain halnya dengan Thalhah bin Khuwailid Al Asadi punya keahlian perang mengaku telah bertemu dengan Jibril dan mendapat wahyu dari Allah, akirnya Thalhah diperangi oleh Abu Bakar Sidiq, semua pasukannya terbunuh dan dia melarikan diri ke Syam, dan pada akhir hayatnya masuk Islam kembali bertobat kepada Allah Swt. Pasa masa yang sama muncul pula seorang wanita mengaku jadi Nabi yaitu Sajah binti Haris Suwaid. Beliau ahli bahasa Arab dan saingan berat Musailamah al Kazzab, ketika dia disuruh nikah dengan Musailamah al Kazzab nabi yang palsu itu menolaknya akhirnya dia bertobat dan masuk Islam. Dalam waktu yang tidak lama, muncul pula Abdul Hasan Ahmad bin Yahya dari golongan Mutazilah, mengaku nabi dan mati tahun 303 H. Dan pada tahun itu juga lahir pula nabi palsu yang bernama Al Mutanabbi dari Kufah Bagdhad. Akhirnya dia mati tahun 354 H. Berikutnya datang pula Abul AÃƒÂ¢la al MaÃƒÂ¢ari dari Syam. Beliau menentang mukjizat Alquran dan membuat Alquran tandingan. Beliau mati tahun 1061 M., tidak sempat bertobat. Terakhir sekali adalah Mirza Ghulam Ahmad lahir 1840 M. mati tahun 1908 M, karena penyakit kolera setelah didoÃƒÂ¢ akan supaya dikutuk oleh Allah Swt. Nabi palsu terakhir ini berasal dari Qadian (nama desa di Punjab India), tidak punya keahlian apa-apa karena dia mengidap penyakit Melancholy (sejenis gila).

Dan ingat yang berdoa pada waktu itu adalah Ibrahim dan Ismail, ketika selesai membangun KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah. 2:130. Dan tidak ada yang benci kepada agama Ibrahim, melainkan orang yang memperbodoh dirinya sendiri, dan sungguh Kami telah memilihnya di dunia dan sesungguhnya dia di akhirat benar-benar termasuk orang-orang yang saleh. Jawab I: Klaim anda bahwa orang-orang arab menyembah patung sebelum Rasulullah SAW di utus, itu tidak saya pungkiri, saya akui bahwa pada zaman itu disebut juga zaman Jahiliyah, itu sebabnya di utus seorang nabi. Memang di dalam Al Quran tidak di jelaskan secara rinci siapa yang di kurbankan oleh Ibrahim. Namun menurut hadits Rasulullah SAW sendiri: Aku adalah anak keturunan dua orang zabihain. Dalam sejarahnya Rasulullah SAW sendiri memang terancam, bapak nenek moyangnya terancam di sembelih. Yang pertama adalah Abdullah, bapak Rasulullah sendiri yang terancam sembelih, yang nyawanya di ganti oleh Allah dengan seratus ekor unta. Dan yang kedua adalah kakek buyutnya yaitu Ismail. Dan julukan Ibnu Zabihain adalah julukan yang terkenal, karena diriyawatkan bahwa orang Arab pun menyapa beliau SAW dengan panggilan itu. Kisah tentang ayah kandung Rasulullah SAW yang juga terancam mau disembelih adalah kisah yang juga sudah kita kenal yaitu nazar kakeknya Abdul Muttalib. Sang kakek ini ketika menggali sumur zamzam pernah bernazar untuk menyembelih anak. Ketika berhasil menggali sumur zamzam, maka Abdul Muttalib berkewajiban untuk melaksanakannazar, lalu diundilah dengan menggunakan anak panah, namun selalu keluar nama Abdullah anaknya yang sangat dicintainya itu. Sehingga setelah beberapa kali selalu nama Abdullah yang keluar, akhirnya ada orang yang menasehatinya untuk menggantinya dengan 100 ekor unta. Barulah setelah Abdul Muttalib menyembelih 100 ekor unta, tidak lagi keluar nama Abdullah dari anak panah undian. Argumen Abu Amru bin Al-Ala Diriwayatkan dari Al-Ashmai bahwa dia bertanya kepada Abu Amru bin Al-Ala tentang siapakah sesungguhnya anak nabiu Ibrahim yang disembelih? Ismail-kah atau Ishaq-kah? Beliau menjawab, Ã¢Â€?Wahai Asmai, di mana otakmu? Sejak kapan Nabi Ishaq itu tinggal di Makkah. Yang di Makkah itu adalah Nabi Ismail as. Dialah yang membangun KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah bersama ayahnya. Dan tempat penyembelihan itu adanya juga di Makkah. Dalil Ayat Quran: Tentang Ciri Nabi IsmailMeski tidak disebutkan secara eksplisit, namun ayat Quran menunjukkan bahwa yang disembelih itu adalah Ismail, bukan Ishaq. Buktinya, ketika Qurna menyebut nama Ismail, beliau disifati dengan sifat penyabar . Dan Ismail, Idris dan Dzulkifli. Semua mereka termasuk orang-orang yang sabar. Dan yang dimaksud dengan sabar pada Ismail adalah sabarnya atas penyembelihan. Dan selain itu Allah juga mensifati beliau dengan sifat Shadiqul WaÃ¢Â€Â™di atau orang yang menepati janjinya. Dan ceritakanlah kisah Ismail di dalam Al-Quraan. Sesungguhnya ia adalah seorang yang benar janjinya, dan dia adalah seorang rasul dan nabi. Dan yang dimaksud dengan yang menepati atau benar janjinya adalah Ismail yang telah berjanji untuk sabar menghadapi cobaan dari Allah untuk disembelih, lalu beliau menepati janjinya untuk tetap bersabar. Dalil Ayat QurÃ¢Â€Â™an Tentang Kondisi Nabi Ishaq as Sedangkan sebaliknya, kalau kita teliti secara cermat, Allah SWT menyebutkan tentang kondisi Nabi Ishaq yang memiliki anak bernama Yaqub. Silahkan perhatikan ayat berikut: Dan isterinya berdiri lalu dia tersenyum, maka Kami sampaikan kepadanya berita gembira tentang Ishaq dan setelah Ishaq: YaÃ¢Â€Â™qub. Kalau ingin dipaksakan bahwa yang disembelih adalah Nabi Ishaq, maka ada dua kemungkian kapan turunnya perintah penyembelihannya. Kemungkinan pertama: Perintah penyembelihan itu sebelum lahirnya anak Ishaq yaitu Yaqub. Dan kemungkinan ini jelas tidak bisa diterima. Mengapa? Bagaimana mungkin Allah memerintahkan untuk menyembelih Ishaq padahal sementara itu Allah juga memberi informasi bahwa Ishaq itu akan punya anak yang bernama Yaqub. Jadi seolah-olah sejak awal perintah untuk menyembelih Ishaq itu sudah ketahuan akhirnya bahwa Ishaq tidak akan mati, lantaran ada informasi bahwa nanti dia akan punya anak yang namanya Yaqub. Kalau Ibrahim tahu bahwa perintah penyembelihan itu pasti akan diganti dengan seekor kambing dan bahwa anaknya itu terus akan hidup dan malah akan punya anak segala, namanya bukan ujian, kan? Tapi main-main. Kemungkinan kedua: Perintah untuk menyembelih Ishaq itu setelah Ishaq punya anak yang bernama Yaqub. Artinya, bisa saja perintah itu datang dan Ishaq sudah dewasa dan bahkan sudah punya anak. Ini malah lebih tidak bisa diterima lagi, sebab langsung bertentangan dengan ayat Al-Quran. Sebab mengenai kisah penyembelihan anak Ibrahim itu, Allah menyebutkan sebagai berikut: Maka tatkala anak itu sampai berusaha bersama-sama Ibrahim, Ibrahim berkata: Hai anakku sesungguhnya aku melihat dalam mimpi bahwa aku menyembelihmu. Maka fikirkanlah apa pendapatmu! Ia menjawab: Hai bapakku, kerjakanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepadamu; insya Allah kamu akan mendapatiku termasuk orang-orang yang sabar. Jadi usia anak yang disembelih itu adalah ketika masih muda dan baru bisa berusaha berjalan menyusul ayahnya. Bukan anak yang sudah punya anak lagi atau sudah jadi bapak buat orang lain. Sehingga dua kemungkinan itu sama-sama tertolak. Ayat Al-Quran: Urut-urutan Kisah Semua sepakat bahwa anak Nabi Ibrahim yang pertama adalah Ismail dan yang kedua adalah Ishaq. Sebelum punya anak, Ibrahim memohon kepada Allah agar diberi anak. Ya Tuhanku, Berilah Aku keturunan yang shalih. Karena tidak mungkin Ibrahim meminta anak ketika sudah punya anak pertama. Secara logika, orang yang berdoa meminta anak adalah orang yang belum punya anak. Lalu Allah mengabulkan doa Ibrahim dengan firman-Nya: Maka Kami beri dia khabar gembira dengan seorang anak yang amat sabar. Dan ayat seterusnya menceritakan tentang anak pertama yang akan disembelih itu. Jadi amat jelas bahwa yang disembelih adalah anak pertama yang bernama Ismail karena selesai Allah memberitakan bahwa doa Ibrahim dikabulkan dan diberi anak, langsung ayat berikutnya berbicara tentang kisah penyembelihan anaknya. Selesai kisah penyembelihan anak, baru Allah berkisah tentang anak Ibrahil yang lain yaitu Ishaq. Amat tidak logis bila yang disembelih adalah Ishaq, karena bukan demikian urut-urutan kisahnya. Khabar Tentang Kisah Penyembelihan di Makkah Selain semua hujjah di atas, masyarakat Makkah memang sangat mengenal kisah penyembelhan itu. Dan yang utama adalah kisah penggantungan tanduk kambing di KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah. Dan itu menunjukkan bahwa anak Ibrahim yang disembelih adalah yang tinggal di Makkah. Sedangkan bila mau dikatakan bahwa yang disembelih adalah Ishaq, maka seharusnya tanduk kambing yang digantung itu bukan di Makkah tapi di Baitul Maqdis, Syam. Dengan demikian, memang kuatlah pendapat yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih itu adalah Ismail dan bukan Ishak. Baik dengan dalil hadits yang matsur, keterangan tafsir antara satu ayat dengan ayat lain, kenyataan sejarah dan juga logika. Namun tidak salah juga untuk kita tahu apa hujjah/argumentasi mereka yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih itu adalah Ishaq. Ayat Quran Mereka mengatakan bahwa ayat Quran menyebutkan bahwa Nabi Ibrahim Hijrah dan maksudnya adalah ke Syam . Setelah itu muncul ayat yang menyebutkan kisah penyembelihan anak . Jadi yang disembelih adalah Ishak karena Ishaq yang tinggal di Syam. Hujjah ini terkoreksi dengan sendirinya, sebab ayat yang menceritakan bahwa Ibrahim hijrah ke Syam itu disisipi doanya yang meminta anak dan ayat yang menceritakan diberinya Ibrahim seorang anak . Baru ayat berikutnya kisah tentang penyembelihan . Jadi 4 ayat itu berbeda waktunya. Ayat 99 terjadi ketika beliau hijrah dari Iraq ke Syam, ayat 100 terjadi di Syam ketika beliau belum punya anak, karena bila yang dia sudah punya anak sebelumnya, tidak mungkin doanya minta anak. Lalu ayat selanjutnya di Makkah ketika beliau dianugerahi anak pertama yaitu Ismail dan berikutnya penyembelihan Ismail itu juga di Makkah . Tapi menurut sebuah riawayat bahwa yang berpaham akan hal ini adalah: Umar ra, Ali ra, al-Abbas ra, Ibnu Masud dan Kaab Al-Ahbar. Selain itu juga ada Ikrimah, Said bin Jbair, As-Suddi, Az-zuhri dan Muqatil. Sebaliknya yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih adalah Ismail antara lain adalah: Ibnu Abbas, Ibnu Umar, Said bin al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan, Mujahid dan Al-Kalbi.

Oleh sebab itu anda sebagai seorang terpelajar seharusnya mempunyai wawasan yang luas akan hal ini. Mampukah anda mencerna dengan benar bahwa 1+1+1=3. Nah agama islam itu mengajarkan hal-hal yang seperti itu, sebab seluruh manusia mengetahui bahwa hasil 3 adalah benar. Tidak ada Ilmu Pengetahuan di dunia ini yang akan membantah apa yang saya katakan tentang penambahan tersebut. Kalau anda mengatakan bahwa 1+1+1=1, anda harus membuktikannya? Sayapun merasa tidak ada Ilmu Pengetahuan yang mampu menterjemahkan hasil tersebut. Hasilnya saja sudah rumit apa lagi dogmanya. Jadi apapun yang anda jabarkan hal itu tidak akan memberikan hasil. Anak kecil saja akan menertawakan anda kalau penjumlahan anda seperti itu. Sudahlah dari segi ilmu anda salah, dari dogmapun anda tidak tahu. Dalam dogma anda bahwa yang menciptakan Langit dan Bumi adalah Yesus. Ilmu pengetahuan mengatakan bahwa umur dunia ini sudah hampir 13,8 Milyar tahun, sedangkan Yesus kamu di lahirkan 2000 tahun yang lalu. Kalau saya katakan bahwa perkataanmu yang tidak konsisten itu baru tepat. Satu lagi dogma anda bahwa Yesus bangkit dan naik ke syurga. Mengapa yesus anda tidak berpesan pada orang2 dan para muridnya bahwa dosa manusia sudah di tebus dan saya akan naik kelangit. Dari mana anda mengetahui bahwa dia tugasnya adalah menebus dosa dan dia naik kelangit? Naik ke langit dalam rangka apa dan mengapa harus di syurga? Kalau demikian mengapa dia tidak menyudahi kehidupan dunia ini toh dosa manusia sudah di tebus? Menurut saya kepercayaan anda tidak memberikan bukti apapun untuk di jadikan pegangan! Masalah percaya dan tidak percaya sama Yesus naik kelangit tidak ada relevansinya dengan penduduk kota Yerussalem. Saya mengatakan kepada anda bahwa mengapa Yesus naik kelangit tidak di saksikan oleh seluruh penduduk kota tersebut. Mengapa hanya orang2 tertentu saja yang anda katakan. Saya mendalami dan mengetahui Ilmu Perencanaan yang namanya Kota apa bila penduduknya di atas 10.000 jiwa. Apakah penduduk Yerussalem hanya 500 orang saja. Apa sangkut pautnya orang yang percaya dan tidak percaya dengan naiknya Yesus ke langit? Itu artinya ada 9500 orang lebih yang tidak percaya sama Yesus namun setidak-tidaknya mereka bisa menjadi saksi bahwa Yesus naik ke langit, bukan? Kalau saya umpamakan begini: Saya sampai kapanpun tidak akan pernah percaya bahwa ada seekor kuda pandai bicara dan di lain waktu kuda tersebut terbang di saksikan sendiri oleh penduduk kota termasuk saya, itu lain soal. Terbangnya kuda tidak akan pernah menjawab kepercayaan saya bahwa dia pandai bicara.

Sebagaian bacaan itu bercampur dengan kesalahan tapi masing2 pihak mempertahankan dan berpegang teguh dengan bacaannya serta menantang orang setiap orang yang menyalahi bacaannya dan bahkan saling mengkafirkan sebagian dari yang lain. Melihat kenyataan ini Hudzaifah segera menghadap Utsman dan melaporkan apa yang di lihatnya. Mendengar laporan ini Utsman mengambil sikap tegas, yaitu mengumpulkan para sahabat termasuk Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari seorang yang pernah membacakan Al Quran untuk terakhir kalinya di hadapan Nabi. Sebelum nabi wafat. Utsman mengatakan kepada Hudzaifah bahwa apa yang di lihat Hudzaifah akan terjadi pula dengan berbagai generasi, apa lagi tempat mereka berada jauh dari tempat turunnya Al Quran. Maka Utsman mengirim seorang utusan ke rumah Hafsah untuk meminjam Mushaf Abu Bakar. Perlu anda ketahui tokoh di balik pengumpulan Al Quran ini adalah Umar Al Khattab Al Faruq ra. Atas ide beliaulah Al Quran itu terkumpul berkat Rahmat Allah. Latar belakang dari ide Umar ini adalah ketika perang Yamamah pecah di zaman pemerintahan Abu Bakar ra. pada tahun 12H. yang melibatkan sejumlah para sahabat yang hafal Al Quran. Dan dalam peperangan ini 70 para sahabat meninggal dunia. Melihat kenyataan ini Umar sangat khawatir dan menghadap Abu Bakar ra, dan mengajukan usulan dan pembukuan Al Quran. Akan tetapi Abu Bakar keberatan atas usulan Umar ini. Tetapi Umar tetap membujuk Abu Bakar, sehinggan Allah membukakan pintu hatinya. Dan pada akhirnya usulan Umar itu di terimah dengan baik oleh Abu Bakar. Kemudian Abu Bakar memerintahkan Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari untuk mengumpulkan Al Quran, mengingat kedudukannya dalam Qiraat, penulisan, pemahaman dan kecerdasan beliau tidak di ragukan lagi. Setelah di bujuk oleh Abu Bakar dan Umar akhirnya Zaid menerima usulan tersebut setelah Allah membukakan kelapangan dada di hatinya. Sebelumnya Zaid pernah berkata kepada kedua orang ini dengan ucapannya yang sangat terkenal, semoga Allah meninggikan kedudukannya di Akhirat, Amin: Ã¢Â€ÂœDemi Allah sekiranya mereka meminta padaku untuk memindahkan gunung maka tidak akan berat bagiku, dari pada perintah untuk mengumpulkan Al QuranÃ¢Â€?. Setelah Al Quran itu terkumpul dengan tingkat ketelitian tinggi dan cermat, maka Mushaf tersebut di simpan oleh Abu Bakar. Setelah Abu bakar meninggal Mushaf ini di simpan oleh Umar dan ketika Umar wafat maka putrinya yang menyimpan Mushaf ini yaitu Hafsah. Itulah sebabnya Utsman mengutus seseorang ke rumah Hafsah untuk meminjam Mushaf Abu Bakar untuk di salin sebayak 7 eksemplar dan di kirim kenegeri2. Sedangkan Mushaf yang asli di kembalikan ke Hafsah. Di dalam sebuah forum Utsman memanggil Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari, Abdulah bin Zubair, Said bin As dan Abdurahman bin Haris bin Hisyam. Orang2 ini di perintah oleh Utsman untuk menyalin Al Quran yang mereka datangi dari rumah Umar yang di simpan oleh Hafsah. Setelah mereka selesai menyalin Mushaf itu maka Utsman memerintahkan kepada mereka agar mengirimnya ke enam tempat dan satu di Madinah. Dan Utsman memerintahkan kepada mereka untuk membakar dialeg Al Quran selain dari yang baru saja mereka salin. Ada tujuh buah Qiraat di dalam penulisan Al Quran ini pada masa itu, antara qiraat yang satu dengan qiraat yang lain berbeda, baik di dalam pengucapan dan penulisan. Qiraat yang tersebar itu mempunyai guru2 agama tersendiri tersendiri, sedangkan yang di ajarkan oleh guru2 qiraat adalah anak2, anak2 akan tumbuh menjadi dewasa, apa bila bertemu antara satu orang dengan orang yang lain maka tentu satu qiraat berbeda dengan satu qiraat yang lain, tidak saja pertengkaran yang akan timbul, perang bisa pecah jadinya. Akibat memiliki cara pandang seperti inilah Utsman memerintahkan untuk membakar qiraat-qiraat yang lain selain dari qiraat yang baru saja mereka salin. Dan qiraat yang mereka salin tersebut adalah qiraat dengan bahasa Quraisy. Jadi tujuan Utsman membakar qiraat yang lain adalah untuk menyatukan umat dalam satu QIRAAT. Yaitu Qiraat yang di kumpulkan oleh Zaid bin Tsabit Al Ansari pada masa pemerintahan Abu Bakar. Nah Mushaf Abu Bakar inilah yang sebenarnya yang di baca oleh penduduk dunia saat ini yang beragama islam. APAKAH ANDA SEKARANG SUDAH PAHAM? cerita ini sudah pernah saya baca dan dengar, jadi terimakasih kalau sudah Anda ulang lagiÃ¢Â€Â¦.Manuscript tertua yang diklaim sebagai peninggalan Utsman ternyata adalah bertuliskan Aksara Kufic, dan kita tahu Kufic bukanlah Quraisy, bagaimana menurut Anda akan hal ini?, 637061=Comment by Robinson A. SihotangÃ¢Â€Â” Januari 19, 2011 #, 296425=Siapa orangnya yang punya Al Quran dan Al Hikmah kalau bukan Nabi Muhammad SAW sendiri. Dan ingat yang berdoa pada waktu itu adalah Ibrahim dan Ismail, ketika selesai membangun KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah. 2:130. Dan tidak ada yang benci kepada agama Ibrahim, melainkan orang yang memperbodoh dirinya sendiri, dan sungguh Kami telah memilihnya di dunia dan sesungguhnya dia di akhirat benar-benar termasuk orang-orang yang saleh. Jawab I: Klaim anda bahwa orang-orang arab menyembah patung sebelum Rasulullah SAW di utus, itu tidak saya pungkiri, saya akui bahwa pada zaman itu disebut juga zaman Jahiliyah, itu sebabnya di utus seorang nabi. Memang di dalam Al Quran tidak di jelaskan secara rinci siapa yang di kurbankan oleh Ibrahim. Namun menurut hadits Rasulullah SAW sendiri: Aku adalah anak keturunan dua orang zabihain. Dalam sejarahnya Rasulullah SAW sendiri memang terancam, bapak nenek moyangnya terancam di sembelih. Yang pertama adalah Abdullah, bapak Rasulullah sendiri yang terancam sembelih, yang nyawanya di ganti oleh Allah dengan seratus ekor unta. Dan yang kedua adalah kakek buyutnya yaitu Ismail. Dan julukan Ibnu Zabihain adalah julukan yang terkenal, karena diriyawatkan bahwa orang Arab pun menyapa beliau SAW dengan panggilan itu. Kisah tentang ayah kandung Rasulullah SAW yang juga terancam mau disembelih adalah kisah yang juga sudah kita kenal yaitu nazar kakeknya Abdul Muttalib. Sang kakek ini ketika menggali sumur zamzam pernah bernazar untuk menyembelih anak. Ketika berhasil menggali sumur zamzam, maka Abdul Muttalib berkewajiban untuk melaksanakannazar, lalu diundilah dengan menggunakan anak panah, namun selalu keluar nama Abdullah anaknya yang sangat dicintainya itu. Sehingga setelah beberapa kali selalu nama Abdullah yang keluar, akhirnya ada orang yang menasehatinya untuk menggantinya dengan 100 ekor unta. Barulah setelah Abdul Muttalib menyembelih 100 ekor unta, tidak lagi keluar nama Abdullah dari anak panah undian. Argumen Abu Amru bin Al-Ala Diriwayatkan dari Al-Ashmai bahwa dia bertanya kepada Abu Amru bin Al-Ala tentang siapakah sesungguhnya anak nabiu Ibrahim yang disembelih? Ismail-kah atau Ishaq-kah? Beliau menjawab, Ã¢Â€?Wahai Asmai, di mana otakmu? Sejak kapan Nabi Ishaq itu tinggal di Makkah. Yang di Makkah itu adalah Nabi Ismail as. Dialah yang membangun KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah bersama ayahnya. Dan tempat penyembelihan itu adanya juga di Makkah. Dalil Ayat Quran: Tentang Ciri Nabi IsmailMeski tidak disebutkan secara eksplisit, namun ayat Quran menunjukkan bahwa yang disembelih itu adalah Ismail, bukan Ishaq. Buktinya, ketika Qurna menyebut nama Ismail, beliau disifati dengan sifat penyabar . Dan Ismail, Idris dan Dzulkifli. Semua mereka termasuk orang-orang yang sabar. Dan yang dimaksud dengan sabar pada Ismail adalah sabarnya atas penyembelihan. Dan selain itu Allah juga mensifati beliau dengan sifat Shadiqul WaÃ¢Â€Â™di atau orang yang menepati janjinya. Dan ceritakanlah kisah Ismail di dalam Al-Quraan. Sesungguhnya ia adalah seorang yang benar janjinya, dan dia adalah seorang rasul dan nabi. Dan yang dimaksud dengan yang menepati atau benar janjinya adalah Ismail yang telah berjanji untuk sabar menghadapi cobaan dari Allah untuk disembelih, lalu beliau menepati janjinya untuk tetap bersabar. Dalil Ayat QurÃ¢Â€Â™an Tentang Kondisi Nabi Ishaq as Sedangkan sebaliknya, kalau kita teliti secara cermat, Allah SWT menyebutkan tentang kondisi Nabi Ishaq yang memiliki anak bernama Yaqub. Silahkan perhatikan ayat berikut: Dan isterinya berdiri lalu dia tersenyum, maka Kami sampaikan kepadanya berita gembira tentang Ishaq dan setelah Ishaq: YaÃ¢Â€Â™qub. Kalau ingin dipaksakan bahwa yang disembelih adalah Nabi Ishaq, maka ada dua kemungkian kapan turunnya perintah penyembelihannya. Kemungkinan pertama: Perintah penyembelihan itu sebelum lahirnya anak Ishaq yaitu Yaqub. Dan kemungkinan ini jelas tidak bisa diterima. Mengapa? Bagaimana mungkin Allah memerintahkan untuk menyembelih Ishaq padahal sementara itu Allah juga memberi informasi bahwa Ishaq itu akan punya anak yang bernama Yaqub. Jadi seolah-olah sejak awal perintah untuk menyembelih Ishaq itu sudah ketahuan akhirnya bahwa Ishaq tidak akan mati, lantaran ada informasi bahwa nanti dia akan punya anak yang namanya Yaqub. Kalau Ibrahim tahu bahwa perintah penyembelihan itu pasti akan diganti dengan seekor kambing dan bahwa anaknya itu terus akan hidup dan malah akan punya anak segala, namanya bukan ujian, kan? Tapi main-main. Kemungkinan kedua: Perintah untuk menyembelih Ishaq itu setelah Ishaq punya anak yang bernama Yaqub. Artinya, bisa saja perintah itu datang dan Ishaq sudah dewasa dan bahkan sudah punya anak. Ini malah lebih tidak bisa diterima lagi, sebab langsung bertentangan dengan ayat Al-Quran. Sebab mengenai kisah penyembelihan anak Ibrahim itu, Allah menyebutkan sebagai berikut: Maka tatkala anak itu sampai berusaha bersama-sama Ibrahim, Ibrahim berkata: Hai anakku sesungguhnya aku melihat dalam mimpi bahwa aku menyembelihmu. Maka fikirkanlah apa pendapatmu! Ia menjawab: Hai bapakku, kerjakanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepadamu; insya Allah kamu akan mendapatiku termasuk orang-orang yang sabar. Jadi usia anak yang disembelih itu adalah ketika masih muda dan baru bisa berusaha berjalan menyusul ayahnya. Bukan anak yang sudah punya anak lagi atau sudah jadi bapak buat orang lain. Sehingga dua kemungkinan itu sama-sama tertolak. Ayat Al-Quran: Urut-urutan Kisah Semua sepakat bahwa anak Nabi Ibrahim yang pertama adalah Ismail dan yang kedua adalah Ishaq. Sebelum punya anak, Ibrahim memohon kepada Allah agar diberi anak. Ya Tuhanku, Berilah Aku keturunan yang shalih. Karena tidak mungkin Ibrahim meminta anak ketika sudah punya anak pertama. Secara logika, orang yang berdoa meminta anak adalah orang yang belum punya anak. Lalu Allah mengabulkan doa Ibrahim dengan firman-Nya: Maka Kami beri dia khabar gembira dengan seorang anak yang amat sabar. Dan ayat seterusnya menceritakan tentang anak pertama yang akan disembelih itu. Jadi amat jelas bahwa yang disembelih adalah anak pertama yang bernama Ismail karena selesai Allah memberitakan bahwa doa Ibrahim dikabulkan dan diberi anak, langsung ayat berikutnya berbicara tentang kisah penyembelihan anaknya. Selesai kisah penyembelihan anak, baru Allah berkisah tentang anak Ibrahil yang lain yaitu Ishaq. Amat tidak logis bila yang disembelih adalah Ishaq, karena bukan demikian urut-urutan kisahnya. Khabar Tentang Kisah Penyembelihan di Makkah Selain semua hujjah di atas, masyarakat Makkah memang sangat mengenal kisah penyembelhan itu. Dan yang utama adalah kisah penggantungan tanduk kambing di KaÃ¢Â€Â™bah. Dan itu menunjukkan bahwa anak Ibrahim yang disembelih adalah yang tinggal di Makkah. Sedangkan bila mau dikatakan bahwa yang disembelih adalah Ishaq, maka seharusnya tanduk kambing yang digantung itu bukan di Makkah tapi di Baitul Maqdis, Syam. Dengan demikian, memang kuatlah pendapat yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih itu adalah Ismail dan bukan Ishak. Baik dengan dalil hadits yang matsur, keterangan tafsir antara satu ayat dengan ayat lain, kenyataan sejarah dan juga logika. Namun tidak salah juga untuk kita tahu apa hujjah/argumentasi mereka yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih itu adalah Ishaq. Ayat Quran Mereka mengatakan bahwa ayat Quran menyebutkan bahwa Nabi Ibrahim Hijrah dan maksudnya adalah ke Syam . Setelah itu muncul ayat yang menyebutkan kisah penyembelihan anak . Jadi yang disembelih adalah Ishak karena Ishaq yang tinggal di Syam. Hujjah ini terkoreksi dengan sendirinya, sebab ayat yang menceritakan bahwa Ibrahim hijrah ke Syam itu disisipi doanya yang meminta anak dan ayat yang menceritakan diberinya Ibrahim seorang anak . Baru ayat berikutnya kisah tentang penyembelihan . Jadi 4 ayat itu berbeda waktunya. Ayat 99 terjadi ketika beliau hijrah dari Iraq ke Syam, ayat 100 terjadi di Syam ketika beliau belum punya anak, karena bila yang dia sudah punya anak sebelumnya, tidak mungkin doanya minta anak. Lalu ayat selanjutnya di Makkah ketika beliau dianugerahi anak pertama yaitu Ismail dan berikutnya penyembelihan Ismail itu juga di Makkah . Tapi menurut sebuah riawayat bahwa yang berpaham akan hal ini adalah: Umar ra, Ali ra, al-Abbas ra, Ibnu Masud dan Kaab Al-Ahbar. Selain itu juga ada Ikrimah, Said bin Jbair, As-Suddi, Az-zuhri dan Muqatil. Sebaliknya yang mengatakan bahwa anak yang disembelih adalah Ismail antara lain adalah: Ibnu Abbas, Ibnu Umar, Said bin al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan, Mujahid dan Al-Kalbi.

Tiga dari 5 puncaknya (utama, tengah, dan selatan) membatasi wilayah Sikkim Utara dari distrik Sikkim, India dan Distrik Taplejung di Nepal, dan 2 yang lain berada di Distrik Taplejung. Selain itu wilayah ini juga dijadikan Kangchenjunga Conservation Area Project oleh World Wildlife Fund [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], yang melindungi satwa Panda Merah, burung, dan tanaman khas Nepal. Bagian India juga memiliki wilayah yang dilindungi dalam Taman Nasional Khangchendzonga.

The duo's works of the mid- to late '90s Ã¢Â€Â” Lifeforms, ISDN, and Dead Cities Ã¢Â€Â” were important stopping points on the road of rabid hybridization characteristic of post-rave European experimental electronica (ambient, jungle, trip-hop, ambient dub, etc.), and the pair's somewhat punk rock attitude (despite their success) did much to underscore the scene's underground roots. After a lengthy hiatus marked by rumors of mental illness and a cottage lifestyle, Cobain and Dougans returned in 2002 with The Isness, a record heavily influenced by '60s and '70s psychedelia. In 2007 the group began a series of ambient/soundscape releases with the album Environments. Environments 2 arrived a year later while Environments 3 landed in 2010. Environments 4 followed in 2012, the same year the group began working on a collaborative album with Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher, but the album was scrapped. By the release of Environments 5 in 2014, only a few tracks from the sessions had appeared, all released on Gallagher's B-sides.}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 02:08:34 GMT"

Flow speeds were very low subsonic with Mach number varying from 0.05 to 0.10. The cavities have length-to-depth ratios of 2.5 and 1.5, with identical depths. It was expected that the aeroelastic film in flutter would interact with acoustic signals from the cavity to enhance or inhibit cavity pressure oscillations. Two different film tensions were applied to the film to affect flutter conditions. However, the film support mechanism design did not allow flutter, and each film experienced static displacement caused by outside air pressure. Cavity sound data recorded by a microphone was compared for tests with and without the film. The effects of film tension were insignificant, primarily because the film was not in flutter. The longer cavity exhibited higher sound pressure levels over the entire range of frequencies with an aeroelastic film present. The shorter cavity showed smaller differences, perhaps because the film is longer than the cavity. The presence of an aeroelastic film did affect the shear-layer frequencies in the cavities. For Cavity 2, higher amplitude peaks in the range of estimated resonance frequencies were observed with the film present. The results for the longer cavity indicate that a film on the opposite wall will interact with cavity pressure oscillations to affect sound pressure levels in resonance.', 'en', 'Film, Subsonic, Cavity flows', 'Thin films.', 'Aeroelasticity.', 'Resonators, Cavity.', 'Effect of an aeroelastic film on confined subsonic cavity resonance', 'Thesis', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Masters', 'University of New Mexico.

The digits that follow indicate the number of LEs in that device. Q. How are ""macrocell equivalents"" related to LEs? A. There is no standard conversion ratio between LEs and macrocells, but based on empirical data extracted from hundreds of customer designs, Altera determined the typical ""equivalent macrocell"" ratio to be approximately 1.3 LEs per macrocell.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students'], ['Comments', 'rural hands on outdoors type', ""For a 2 year college, I would day this would probably be one of the best choices out of the other 2 year colleges in Georgia. This is a good choice if you want that 4 year college feel without actually being in a 4 year college, but going to Georgia Perimeter would probably be the best bet if you want to save more money. The campus is gorgeous and big (they have cows and horses!) and the dorms are basically perfection (for a 2 year college), but, please, do NOT let the beauty of the campus fool you into going here like it did to me. The campus is pretty and the teachers are enthusiastic, but the students- I repeat, the STUDENTS- are HORRID. These are the most close-minded people I have ever met in my life. They are nice and friendly, but ignorant. All the stereotypes about southern people are true. Their minds are as closed as the bible. Ok, some of the students are open minded and intelligent, but please keep in mind that this is a school where I have actually heard someone say I don't think dinosaurs are real. They weren't mentioned in the bible. and other people didn't vote in the presidential elections because they claimed the candidates were the actual, literal anti-christ (they were serious). Being at this college makes me feel intellectually deprived. This is not a good college for the artsy types- this college will not allow you to spread your wings and stand out from the crowd. Don't get me wrong, the students are smart (mostly) and politics are a big thing down here, but they just seem to be closed off in their own opinions""]]",Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Abraham-Baldwin-Agricultural-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/87599,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00084-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,890426991,890374331,HORIZONTAL,"12/10/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 10 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 51 Louis from Lawrenceville, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The teachers, staff, and other students are welcoming and ready and willing to answer any questions and help you out. The classes are very interesting and close-knit, especially those during Jan Term., 34777=The Academic program at Saint Mary's is on of a kind. Aside from getting a major they really make sure you receive a fully rounded education through their diversity requirements and Jan term. They also offer a lot of tutoring and assistance in order to make sure every student will succeed., 64405=saint mary's has really great classes and even a jan term, but compared to my standards, the classes could be harder. sometimes i feel that it's pretty much senior year of high school, but with more reading and studying. as long as you actually study, you should do fine., 113028=Saint Mary's is the perfect combination of small school utilities with certain big school aspects. It has small class sizes which are essential in the professor-student relationships that are formed, but it has division one sports and is located in the San Francisco Bay Area making it far from your typical small school. Finally, the collegiate seminar program and Saint Mary's unique January term, it provides student with one of a kind educational opportunities., 306210=Probably a little overpriced, but there are high qualtity professors, most have at least a masters degree in selected field. A new recreactional center is in progress of being built and will be finished by Spring 2015 and that will be very very nice to have, 123525=ugh, the food tastes great the first few days, then you notice that the food gets worse and worse. The unlimited plan is worth it though, trust me, though the food isn't the best, it is good enough at 9:30 at night when everything closes in the town., 74128=the academics here are tough, but helpful. i find myself doing a lot of homework, but i do learn a lot, which is what school is all about. since saint mary's is a catholic school, religion does play into the academics some, but if you aren't that religious it doesn't matter because it's not an overpowering factor of this school. we also have jan term, which is where you take a class that doesn't have to do with your major (unless you want it to) for the month of january, which is really fun. and of course, there's study abroad., 326938=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 233568=Contact at least one administrator on campus because they will direct you practically to anyone or anywhere. The more you talk to people the more connections you can make and pretty soon you have 10 people who are willing to help you with anything. The sooner you turn in your application the sooner you get a response which is very helpful because most schools wait till April to hand out decisions., 291876=During the Weekend of Welcome, students are thrust into multiple large campus activities such as Freshman Olympics, Painting the SMC, Hiking to the Cross, and Pool Parties. But the most famous tradition we have is Jan Term, which is where the entire month of January is set aside for students to take only one class for 2-4 hours 4 times a week. Each year there is a theme, but not all classes follow the theme. Students are encouraged to choose classes outside their major such as Harry Potter and Barbarians!, but they also offer classes like math and language. This is a way for students to slowly get back into the feel of classes after winter break and also give plenty of time for campus events., 16750=SMC has a unique 4-1-4 semester system. We have four-month long semesters with a one month January Term break in between. During Jan term, students study only one class not necessarily related to their majors. This gives them time to explore other interests or pursue individual projects like community service. Last year, one of my friends took a course on chocolate making during this time and travel courses are available for Jan Term, too., 233053=Last year in 2012 every single student who applied for Medical School was accepted into their first choice school! What also is really impressive is the upperclassmen all talk differently. They can express their ideas very easily with accuracy and smooth fluency; creating an overall sophisticated and articulate speech.}",,

Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education. Students that are looking for a quite environment rich with opportunities to be involved in the community while getting a top notch education should strongly consider what Saint Mary's has to offer. At the very least, come by to check it out! We have student ambassadors that love school this school as much as I do and are dying to tell you why."", ""Definitely come to campus to check it out, especially if you are in the area. I fell in love with the school when I came here to check it out because at first the idea of a small and secluded school didn't appeal to me, but once I saw for myself the beauty of this place I couldn't resist. They have various overnight programs for accepted students to get to know what the school is about before deciding. Definitely apply, especially since they are pretty generous with waiving application fees, it is worth while to give it a shot. The school is getting more and more well known and it amazes people because we are this tiny Catholic school but we've made it to the 5th place I believe on Forbes magazine of colleges who's graduates make the most money in 10 years. We are up there with Stanford and UC Berkeley. We were also ranked in US News and Weekly as one of the top schools on the West coast and we have numerous famous and successful alumni that love this school so much they are constantly supporting it. This school is truly one of the nation's best educational institutions and we are known for that as well."", ""While the sticker price of the school is around 50,000 like all other private schools, I believe over 80% of the students that attend Saint Mary's have some kind of financial aid, whether academic or need based. There are so many free services here such as free plays, games, activities, clubs, shows, recreational classes, etc, that it is really worth it because everything is paid for. Isn't it nice for the teachers that you are paying so much money for to actually know your name? Also, if money is a concern there are many jobs available on campus as well as outside of the campus in the Walnut Creek area to help pay tuition. In the end all those little nice things, like free planners, weekend of welcome (the first weekend of school for freshman where activities are planned to get everyone familiarized with the school), and the free bbq every wednesday afternoon (community time), really makes it more worth it. Even now, a public UC school costs 30,000 dollars so the gap is no longer as big as it used to be."", ""The campus is beautiful, the buildings on campus is reminiscent of Spanish Missions and there are trees and grass all over campus. The campus certainly has enough room for anything you need, but is compact enough to walk from one side to another in no more than 10 minutes. The weather is pretty nice, it is sunny during the day but it gets cool during the night and morning. These is a feeling of peace on campus that is perfect for an educational institution and really gets you in the mood for learning and being relaxed. They offer many things to the students such as dances and events held by the Campus Activities Board. Some of the things that I've attended is friendship bracelet making night, Salsa lessons, and a pretty big school dance. They offer yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes that are free for students to attend. They also have a counseling center, where you can get a therapist or counselor to talk to for free to manage stress. There are many clubs and organizations that are on campus to be a part of and many of them go on trips to San Francisco, Southern California, and Tahoe during winter."", ""This college is an excellent school if your goal of going to college is for an education. The class sizes are small, about 30 students in my largest class section which is General Chemistry and my smallest class, Seminar, probably has about 15 or so students. For a lot of science major students, the first year of General Chem is the hardest however the professors hear have open office hours and various on campus tutoring centers to help with the subject. Same is available for Math and English courses as well. As a freshman in the Honors/Science living learning community, which is a special dorm that houses the head of the math department as well as honors program, I can literally knock on my neighbor's door, and a math professor is out to help me with my homework even if it is something as trivial and reviewing how to factor polynomials. For students that really want to learn, the Seminar program is excellent as it teaches students the basic historical ideas and literature throughout time that any educated person should know. Also, if you are planning on attending graduate school, the professors and programs here are really designed to hold your hand and help you get a good grade instead of a large school or even worst, a large public school (like a UC) where their main goal is to see who is the last one standing.""]]",Saint Mary's College of California Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Saint-Marys-College-of-California/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/66293,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00084-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,890566255,890495771,HORIZONTAL,"01/25/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 16 out of 18 people found this review useful. 1 of 67 Julianne from Yakima, WA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It does mean however that 2 religion courses will be required to graduate but they are not difficult and it is a great to be educated about religion as it is plays a huge role in society. Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education.

There are so many free services here such as free plays, games, activities, clubs, shows, recreational classes, etc, that it is really worth it because everything is paid for. Isn't it nice for the teachers that you are paying so much money for to actually know your name? Also, if money is a concern there are many jobs available on campus as well as outside of the campus in the Walnut Creek area to help pay tuition.

Although the curriculum is very difficult, it is definitely possible to accomplish. It makes graduation that much more exciting!', 'Prospective students should understand that college is no joke. Although high school may be easy for many, college is a huge culture shock, academically and personally.

It does mean however that 2 religion courses will be required to graduate but they are not difficult and it is a great to be educated about religion as it is plays a huge role in society. Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education.

These is a feeling of peace on campus that is perfect for an educational institution and really gets you in the mood for learning and being relaxed. They offer many things to the students such as dances and events held by the Campus Activities Board. Some of the things that I've attended is friendship bracelet making night, Salsa lessons, and a pretty big school dance. They offer yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes that are free for students to attend. They also have a counseling center, where you can get a therapist or counselor to talk to for free to manage stress.

Assumption hall is a quieter hall for honors freshman but is separated from the rest of the housing here. The other halls are spread about main campus and range from nice to mediocre depending on the building and floor.', 'The academic rigor at SMC is really up to the individual. Some majors will require hours of homework a night and others will require very little. If you are looking for added challenge you can always sign up for free .25 credit classes that meet once a week. These classes can also help you see what other studies might interest you. SMC also has a great honors program and I would recommend that all students at least look at it, if you are looking for a bit more challenge.', 'Hit the ground running. There is so much available to students here but you have to get your name out there. Your first two weeks here are incredibly important for the rest of your semester. This is an amazing college for networking and getting to know people early on will open up so many doors for you.', ""Saint Mary's College of California is a place full of opportunity but you must be willing to take the first step.

We have people of all backgrounds, races, gender, sexuality, religious beliefs here on campus and everyone is treated equally and with respect.

It does mean however that 2 religion courses will be required to graduate but they are not difficult and it is a great to be educated about religion as it is plays a huge role in society. Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education.

The Lasallian style course load gives students a focus more towards gaining skills that the will be able to use in new situations versus just in their major.

Saint Marys does everything in its power to help you get financial aid through scholarships they will sponsor, loans, and financial planning. The Career center is a great resource for students who want help planning their career or internships which I highly recommend you use. Overall, every penny you put towards educating yourself is returned twice fold with the skills you gain to help you for the rest of your life.', 'Besides the numerous on-campus events such as movies, guest speakers, dinners, events and club meetings put on by the Residence Hall Association and Campus Activities Board there are sporting events held in the fields and in stadium. Students can also do lots of hiking up to the cross or to the Lady of the Great Oaks. We have intramural sport teams as well as club teams for those who are more competitive.Off campus students can head into Moraga to see the shops and have a bite to eat. A little further down the road is Rheem which had department stores and a bit further is Lafayette which is a quaint little town with multiple restaurants, shops, apartments, and the BART station. You can access all of these places free by riding the County Connection bus line, but BART will take you anywhere you would like, such as San Fran or up to Walnut Creek where most people love to go shopping and watch movies.', ""I don't know about you, but I get better food here than I do at home! Sodexo, the company which provides our food, is always changing up the menu every day and for special occasions. The International section is always featuring meals with salmon, stir-fry, ribs, burritos, chicken, and pork. The grill is always open with hamburgers, turkey burgers, quesadillas, and grilled cheese next to the Pizza and Pasta Corner Bistro. The Legacy Garden provides gluten free and vegetarian/vegan options like tofu, falafel sandwiches, veggie patties, veggie wraps and curries that rotate every day. There is always a sandwich and salad bar near the fruit counter for quick meals while the cereal counter with drinks like tea, coffee and hot chocolate are always open. To top it all off there is a large glass display case featuring delicious sweets and pastries made right behind the counter. At Saint Marys we have a meal plan where you can choose meals per week instead of paying per item. Students are welcome for seconds ,as long as they get their hand stamped on the way out. However, some students prefer to get Starbucks coffee at CafÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â© Louis with a small sandwich bar with pastries.

Our RA's are great resources for upper-classmen knowledge but are also great friends. They keep the peace while also planning great events for the entire hall. We've had a Make Your Own Pizza Night, Star Wars Marathons, Tea and Cookies Wednesdays, Murder Mystery Nights, Guest Speakers and many more. All the people on both floors are very welcoming, always keeping their doors open for social interaction. The RD, Chris Jones affectionately called 'Jonesy', his wife Mary, and their one year old son Owen are the highlight of the top floor as they play games up and down the hall. All in all, the only downside is how far we are from the dinning hall compared to the other halls."", 'Like all colleges, you get out what you put in. The Seminar classes are constructed to be a graduate level course disguised as an undergraduate to help your mind grow beyond simple analysis of texts. These classes, as well as many others, will challenge you to go above and beyond your basic skills, but not so far as to discourage you. They are meant to expand and challenge you to the point of education growth without making you feel discouraged.', ""If you can, take a tour of Saint Marys' campus. It is beautiful and will give you a sense of how the campus feels. Before accepting to enroll, know that you will be given core requirements that reach into all areas: science, math, English, social justice, common good, religion, and diversity. If you are looking for a large party school on the edge of the city, you might want to apply elsewhere. Saint Mary's, while only a forty minute BART ride away, is situated atop a hilltop overlooking a quaint town. This is a school for education and learning, not a place to party.

The unlimited plan is worth it though, trust me, though the food isn't the best, it is good enough at 9:30 at night when everything closes in the town., 74128=the academics here are tough, but helpful. i find myself doing a lot of homework, but i do learn a lot, which is what school is all about. since saint mary's is a catholic school, religion does play into the academics some, but if you aren't that religious it doesn't matter because it's not an overpowering factor of this school. we also have jan term, which is where you take a class that doesn't have to do with your major (unless you want it to) for the month of january, which is really fun. and of course, there's study abroad., 326938=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 233568=Contact at least one administrator on campus because they will direct you practically to anyone or anywhere. The more you talk to people the more connections you can make and pretty soon you have 10 people who are willing to help you with anything. The sooner you turn in your application the sooner you get a response which is very helpful because most schools wait till April to hand out decisions., 291876=During the Weekend of Welcome, students are thrust into multiple large campus activities such as Freshman Olympics, Painting the SMC, Hiking to the Cross, and Pool Parties. But the most famous tradition we have is Jan Term, which is where the entire month of January is set aside for students to take only one class for 2-4 hours 4 times a week. Each year there is a theme, but not all classes follow the theme. Students are encouraged to choose classes outside their major such as Harry Potter and Barbarians!, but they also offer classes like math and language. This is a way for students to slowly get back into the feel of classes after winter break and also give plenty of time for campus events., 16750=SMC has a unique 4-1-4 semester system. We have four-month long semesters with a one month January Term break in between. During Jan term, students study only one class not necessarily related to their majors. This gives them time to explore other interests or pursue individual projects like community service. Last year, one of my friends took a course on chocolate making during this time and travel courses are available for Jan Term, too., 233053=Last year in 2012 every single student who applied for Medical School was accepted into their first choice school! What also is really impressive is the upperclassmen all talk differently. They can express their ideas very easily with accuracy and smooth fluency; creating an overall sophisticated and articulate speech.}",,

It is diversified and exciting. Greek life is the nucleus for many smart and interested students who work hard and join these organizations. For us observers, it is it is an emotional charge to see the Greeks perform, and to attend their activities.', 'Tops! UAPB offers a whole smorgasbord of clubs and activities. The list would be nearly infinite. The sweet inspirations of purpose and resolve, however, allows the students multi challenges and opportunities of participation. I feel that it is more important to address that, rather than to name the affiliations and activities. Yes, the many clubs and activities allow students an independence that is most valuable. An independence to choose and to participate, an independence to identify with others on a college level, to compete on a college level, and to enjoy as college student in a safe and supervised setting.', 'The biology department is equipped with master minds who have provided an excellent foundation for many graduates that have become health professionals: nurses, doctors, dentists, and so forth. Students interested in the sciences will appreciate this institution. There is a rich heritage of teachers from our school. The education Department is a great place for those who want to go into that field. Students wanting contemporary skills can appreciate our Home Economics/ Child Care/ Life Skills Areas. There are more to apply, but little freedom to do so in this brief assignment/ writing today.', 'Whereas, many schools have abandoned the idea of giving thanks to a higher image than ourselves, UAPB assemblies and gatherings traditionally begin with giving thanks and expressing thanks for what already is. We have a fishery department. the aquatic exhibit there is phenomenal.', 'The biggest truth I could tell you is that while UAPB is predominately Black, so am I, and I love it that way. The social life aspect expressed by many students is that they enjoy knowing so many of the same ethnic people as they are, who are about something really good, really serious, really aspiring. In other words, it is great to be around people who are not absent - mindedly running their lives with foolish interests and non-productive lifestyles and hustles. It just makes us proud.', ""Students can enjoy game rooms, speciality dances, plain ole' sock hops, talent shows, fashion shows, Greek participation or observation (whichever), all kinds of sports like tennis, and etc., youth ministry involvement/fun, contests in specific areas, fitness activities... lots of fun going on around here @ UAPB. Fun gets an 8 on my rating scale."", ""It is a subjective view, but I have to give you what you ask for, here. Our Southern Cooks provide an array of delicious foods in or mess hall everyday. We have snack bars for sandwich-type dining available on campus, and variety food and drink machines in handy locations . I'd have to give our food and dining facilities another 8."", ""Comfortable, safe, new and exciting are words that describe my dorm experiences @UAPB, so far. Although we share many items, it is still wise to leave no one in your room without being there yourself. We are on a smoke- free university campus, so some problems (mainly like careless fires) are unlikely to happen. Our dorms have computer rooms and lounges. These are the real escort for us students who are seriously pursuing an education. These services along with kitchen facilities put a smile on our faces each time we get home (to the dorm, I mean). I'll give our dorms a great 8!"", ""I find that you get what you put into each class. Teachers @UAPB will help you through your work, but they do not do it for you. They encourage you to do it, persistently. Classes require a lot of reading, memorizing, and a lot of written interpretation. Tests come about real often. In some of my classes, students are expected to know and do (research) above and beyond on that unit, but there is often a bonus for this extra mile. Programs such as, The McNairs Scholars Program gives UAPB's academic platform a big boost. Students receive direction, guidance and stiff but meaningful assignments that are academically challenging to them. I'll give the system a big ole' 8."", ""You want to make early requests for services you need, like preferred roommates or extra space, because many students have made contact for a long time as they wait anxiously to get in UAPB. Also, request a calendar and pay attention to important dates for Orientations and workshops for new students. Recruiters @UAPB go the whole mile and some more- so I'll give them an 8 for their tips also to interested students."", 'The University of Arkansas @ Pine Bluff (UAPB) deserves a high grade of 8 out of 10 on its smooth admissions procedures for students. It deserves an 8 for its research provisions @ the library for students. It deserves an 8 on how it allows the student government to be effective in the entire scheme of promoting and implementing ideas for us.']]",University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Arkansas-at-Pine-Bluff/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/26083,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,7,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00084-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,890609263,890575493,HORIZONTAL,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 17 out of 17 people found this review useful. 1 of 28 Kenya from Memphis, TN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Yes, the teachers are generally nice and have time to talk to you, but other than that, the instruction is terrible. I have now been here for two semesters and out of 12 classes, I have found 1 that actually challenges me. The teachers expectations are generally low and its a miracle if they actually teach you something in the class. I am taking 18 credits, working part time and have more than enough spare time. This should be a red flag. I have A's in all my classes and barely study. Why you ask? The teachers either don't care, have low expectations of the students (maybe due to geographic location and culture) or are just unqualified teachers. Just because it is an HBCU, does not mean it gives appropriate education and being that it is historical doesn't equate to a good education. If you look at graduation rate statistics, you'll see the statistic is extremely low. Yes, its great if you want to slide by in college and pass with a degree, but what if you actually want to do something in life, maybe apply for a competitive job or apply for a master's program? I can guarantee you the education you receive here will not prepare you for the next step. Most teachers let you turn in work late, let you use your book on exams, and expect you to learn most of the information yourself. Also, I have asked several times for recommendation letters for scholarships, or advising issues to be completed and no one gets anything done unless you hound them for a month. I don't have time to be a student and do a teachers job as well. This university is providing a disservice to its students and using the term HBCU to hide behind.

This proposed AD would affect about 96 airplanes of U.S. registry. The actions that are required by AD 2006-05-09 and retained in this proposed AD take about 541 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the currently required actions is $45,985 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The new proposed Area 2 inspections would take about 124 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the new inspections specified in this proposed AD for U.S. operators is $1,011,880, or $10,540 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The new proposed modification would take about 4,799 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Required parts costs per airplane would be minimal.

This proposed AD would affect about 96 airplanes of U.S. registry. The actions that are required by AD 2006-05-09 and retained in this proposed AD take about 541 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the currently required actions is $45,985 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The new proposed Area 2 inspections would take about 124 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Based on these figures, the estimated cost of the new inspections specified in this proposed AD for U.S. operators is $1,011,880, or $10,540 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The new proposed modification would take about 4,799 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $85 per work hour. Required parts costs per airplane would be minimal.

The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection. This standard applies to employers performing work on electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installations, as well as employers in other industries.

The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

The final rule becomes effective on August 3, 2015. 29 CFR Part 1926 Summary OSHA is adding a new subpart to provide protections to employees working in confined spaces in construction. This new subpart replaces OSHA's one training requirement for confined space work with a comprehensive standard that includes a permit program designed to protect employees from exposure to many hazards associated with work in confined spaces, including atmospheric and physical hazards. The final rule is similar in content and organization to the general industry confined spaces standard, but also incorporates several provisions from the proposed rule to address construction-specific hazards, accounts for advancements in technology, and improves enforceability of the requirements. 2014-09-26; vol. 79 # 187 - Friday, September 26, 2014 79 FR 57785 - Cranes and Derricks in Construction: Operator Certification GPO FDSys XML | Text",False,-1,0,"{12259=On April 11, 2014 (79 FR 20316), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published a final rule: Revising the general industry standards for electric power generation, transmission, and distribution work and for electrical protective equipment; revising the construction standard for electric power transmission and distribution work; and adopting a new construction standard for electrical protective equipment. The final rule updated those standards and made the general industry and construction standards consistent. This document corrects errors in the preamble and regulatory text of the final rule., 46557=OSHA is extending the comment period on the Request for Information on Chemical Management and Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) to October 9, 2015., 70923=This notice schedules an informal public hearing on OSHA's proposed extension of the crane-operator certification deadline and the separate existing employer duty to ensure that their crane operators are competent. The Agency proposed three-year extensions for both, from November 10, 2014, to November 10, 2017., 17064=OSHA last issued rules for the construction of transmission and distribution installations in 1972. Those provisions are now out of date and inconsistent with the more recently promulgated general industry standard covering the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution lines and equipment. OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection. This standard applies to employers performing work on electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installations, as well as employers in other industries. The final rule removes the requirement for employees to wear protective footwear as protection against electric shock., 31480=Ã‚Â§ 1911, 82312=On August 9, 2010, OSHA issued a final standard establishing requirements for cranes and derricks used in construction work.

We also reviewed a number of studies suggesting effective approaches to prevent and control pesticide-related respiratory diseases in the workplace.

A cross-sectional study of pesticide handling practices among Cambodian farmers suggested that most of the pesticides used in agriculture belonged to the World Health Organization (WHO) class I (extremely and highly dangerous) and class II (moderately dangerous) categories [145]. Therefore, one immediate aim might be to reduce the use of WHO Classes I and II pesticides, and replace these pesticides with less-toxic alternatives, especially in developing countries [146]. In Europe and North America, government agencies, such as the EPA in the US, the PMRA (Pest Management and Regulation Agency) in Canada, and the EEA (European Environment Agency) in the European Union, control pesticide use quite closely. These government agencies put forth policies and regulations on production and use of pesticides. Governmental regulations for reducing the use of pesticides include mandate reduction through national policies and enforcement [147,148], restricted registration [149] and taxation and attrition [150] on old toxic pesticides. For example, in Canada, there have been substantial decreases in cosmetic use of pesticide (from 25% to 11%) and hiring of lawn care companies (from 15% to 5%) after a province-wide ban of cosmetic pesticides in 2009 in Ontario [151]., 97976=In 1998 pesticide exposure was listed as one of the top respiratory health hazards in agricultural by the American Thoracic Society [183]. Nevertheless, Kirkhorn and Garry in their review of agricultural lung diseases suggested that, although there were notable exceptions, pesticides may not be either a single or direct cause of chronic pulmonary diseases, such as asthma [184]. Other than pesticide exposures, many factors such as variations in genetic makeup, physiological states, socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, and other environmental factors may also contribute to the development of respiratory symptoms and diseases. These factors must be considered along with pesticide exposures when evaluating the effects of pesticide on respiratory health., 17898=Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10(12), 6442-6471; doi:10.3390/ijerph10126442, 26255=Pesticides are widely used in occupational settings and residential areas to prevent and control pests and pests-induced diseases [1]. Based on the target, pesticides are mainly grouped into herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, and rodenticides (Table 1). Based on chemical properties, pesticides can also be categorized into organochlorines (OC), organophosphates (OP), carbamates, dithiocarbamates, pyrethroids, phenoxyl, triazine, amide, and coumadin compounds (Table 1). Other substances such as sulfur fumigants, urea derivatives and even botanic and biological products have also been used as pesticides in human history. For example, the element sulfur was used as a fumigant by Chinese farmers around 1000 B.C. [13]. There are historical reports of using the seed of strychnos nuxvomica as a rodenticide, and the root of Derris Eliptica (a source of rotenone) as an insecticide [13]. In addition, protein product expressed by microbe Bacillus thuringiensis has been used as an insecticide [14].}",,
