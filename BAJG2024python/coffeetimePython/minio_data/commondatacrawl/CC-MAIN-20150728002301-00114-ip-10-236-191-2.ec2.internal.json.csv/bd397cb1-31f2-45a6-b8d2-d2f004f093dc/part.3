There is also an all organic grab'n'go with vegan friendly options and locally produced foods. The quality of food in the dorm dining halls is questionable, however.

Boulder also has several local breweries, tea shops, and a farmers market."", 'Even for transfer students, dorm life at CU can be a lot of fun and a good opportunity to meet other students. Most students are very friendly and open to new experiences, and many keep their doors open. The dorms are typically safe, although common sense should always be used. It can also be difficult finding a quiet place to study, as most dorm residents are freshmen who enjoy partying. However, the age range is fairly broad, with residents typically being 18-25.', 'The core requirements for graduation in Arts & Sciences are a little heavy, with a minimum of 5 science courses, including a lab. Foreign language proficiency and advanced writing are also part of the core. The average courses are challenging, but they are not overly difficult, either. Academic rigor also depends on the department. While astronomy and math are strong and challenging, some departments such as English and art are relatively weak.', 'While CU has a reputation of being a party school, the accuracy of that reputation has decreased in recent years. However, because of this reputation, many schools do not accept transfer credits from CU, so keep that in mind if transferring is a possibility for you. Also keep in mind that the courses at CU are challenging, though mostly at intro levels, so new students should put studying ahead of partying or you may end up on academic probation.', 'CU is one of the top schools you can go to for sciences, particularly astronomy and physics with 4 Nobel Laureates, and the only public school to receive funding from NASA. With a beautiful campus at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, CU has a lively atmosphere with people from many different social backgrounds.']]",University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Colorado-Boulder/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/113455,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,142,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00114-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,892280323,892118558,HORIZONTAL,"08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 38 out of 39 people found this review useful. 1 of 205 John from Arvada, CO Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There are also some free tutoring services on campus, and tutoring is free if you live in the residence halls. The campus is beautiful.

Most of the professors are easy to talk to and easy to get in contact with, so there is always a way you can get help. There are also some free tutoring services on campus, and tutoring is free if you live in the residence halls. The campus is beautiful.

Virtually any outdoor activity you can think of is readily available to do, including skiing, hiking, cycling, fishing, and longboarding. Beyond the outdoors, Boulder also hosts an incredible music scene every night of the week across all genres.', 'There is a wide variety of eateries across the campus, each which hosts a superb selection of meals. The dining halls keep a healthy variety and rarely disappoint.', 'The dorms are beautifully built with stone and fostered with years of personality. Each dorm has its own style and there are even specified dorms for honors students, engineers, and LGBT that suit certain preferences if you like. The dorms host a plethora of activities throughout the year and some even provide their own classes, which is a great way to learn something new and meet people within your living community.', 'As an Engineering student, the academics are expected to take up a lot of time. There are great options of classes to take, and they are taught by generally excellent faculty.', 'Because of the wide variety of opportunity in Boulder, I would recommend getting involved as soon as possible.

There also a lot of things for people who like the outdoors to do (for example, hiking, skating, mountain climbing, biking, jogging, etc). There is actually a place for everyone because there are different schools and so many different student-fun clubs. You should visit the school if you haven't already, and you'll see that there are all different types of people that attend. Tips for prospective students For your first couple of days, you should carry a campus map around with you. Some of the planners they sell in the book stores come with maps in the back, so that's not a problem. Also, at the end of each semester, make sure that you sell your books back to Shipping On the Hill, because they give you more money than the school book store does. Also make sure that you manage time wisely. It can be easy to get into the habit of partying every weekend, but make sure you study, because when finals come along, so do the consequences.

There are well known places like, The Hill, Pearl Street Mall, 29th Street Mall and downtown Boulder that give you so many things to do on the weekend. Whether it's attending a festival in central park, going to The Spot for rock climbing, or catching a concert at the Fox Theatre, Boulder has many attractions and things to do. This town has character. Not to mention CU Boulder's UMC (University Memorial Center) has a bowling alley, which is pretty cool."", ""I think CU Boulder has the best dining halls not only in Colorado, but in the country. Our main attraction is the C4C (Center for Community). You swipe in and you have free reign to a buffet of different types of food - Mexican, Italian, American Grill, Persian, Asian, Kosher, and a sushi bar. Along with that there is a large salad station, cereal, and sandwich station. That's my favorite place, but if you're like me living in a dorm off the main campus you can go to the dining hall in your area. In each cluster of dorms on campus is a dining hall, and some dorms actually have their own dining halls. But if you feel like grabbing something quick you can always going to several of the university's Grab and Go location. Aside from everything provided to students on campus, Boulder has great restaurants - many of which are local, small businesses, which are fun to try when you have time to grab a bite on the Hill or Pearl Street"", ""For some, I adjusting to the dorm life was difficult. You're living for yourself, basically. Although the nice thing is you have the dining halls for food, you have your RA's and front desk people to answer question about the city of Boulder, and you have everyone on your floor that is in the same boat as you - some are actually sophomores or upperclassmen who already have experience in the dorms. I personally enjoyed the dorm life because it gave me the freedom to do what I wanted - and on the bright side, if you don't live in a suite that is, you don't really have to do that many chores (just wash your clothes and dishes). Even though I live in the dorms that are off the main campus there is still a nice bus system (the Buff Bus) that takes me to campus, or a bike path that takes me less than 10 minutes to get on campus."", ""It's college, and the courses are going to be hard.

However difficult the classes may be for you, there is always help here.

Just make sure you take advantage of every possible resources to get the information in your head."", ""Naturally, while you are still in high school, keep up the grades, get involved, and begin developing a study pattern. That truly is the hardest part about college, the adjustment into the dorms is easy and finding your way around campus becomes immediately easy. So really start cracking down on finding a good study pattern, let it become habit, so when you get to college, and the courses getting going, you're not caught by surprise when the first midterms start coming around. Don't worry about anything, come to school ready to work and to learn. There are people here for you to give you all the help you need.

There is also a system called CU Night Ride that will give anyone a ride to areas around the school at anytime of night for whatever reason, and it is absolutely free. There are even emergency stations around campus with a button you can push for help, so it is very safe here.

Most dorms have special programs for their residents going on all the time, ranging from movie nights, to tutors, to talent shows. There are also many more great resources on campus like the health center and the UMC that always have something to offer."", ""There are plenty of ways to have fun up here! There is the 29th Street Mall for shopping, Pearl Street which has a lot of great shops and restaurants to go check out, and the Hill where a lot of students go to eat and hang out. There are also great places on campus that have bowling and pool tables, or you could go to the Recreation Center to swim, rock climb, play basketball, or even ice skate!

Everyone gets sick of the food once in a while, but there are four dining halls, and most of them are really great! There is always a variety of food available from Italian, to Persian, to American, to Latin, and the dining halls are always clean! There are also stations to get food to go, called grab and goes, that are also really good.', 'Some of the dorms are excellent, and some of them are not so great.

Be prepared to have a lot of time set aside for homework, because there is a lot of it. Some classes are very laid back though too, and give you an opportunity to learn something outside of your major, so it is very well rounded.', ""A tip would be to visit campus and make sure you like it up here. A school can have everything you want academically, but if you don't like the atmosphere, then you shouldn't go. Overall, I would just say to make sure you know everything about the school you can and that you are prepared for what's ahead of you, because college is nothing like high school."", 'The University of Colorado Boulder is a great school in a great place.

There also a lot of things for people who like the outdoors to do (for example, hiking, skating, mountain climbing, biking, jogging, etc). There is actually a place for everyone because there are different schools and so many different student-fun clubs. You should visit the school if you haven't already, and you'll see that there are all different types of people that attend. Tips for prospective students For your first couple of days, you should carry a campus map around with you. Some of the planners they sell in the book stores come with maps in the back, so that's not a problem. Also, at the end of each semester, make sure that you sell your books back to Shipping On the Hill, because they give you more money than the school book store does.

If you want to shop, the Pearl Street Mall is a great mix of chain stores and local unique businesses, plus the food is great. CU has enough clubs for everyone to find their niche, although that's not the only way to meet new friends. Even right on campus there's a bowling alley and food like Panda Express and Coldstone!

If you eat at the C4C (main dining hall) all the time, no matter how great the food is the first month, you're gonna get sick of it. Some residence halls have their own dining centers, which anyone can go in to eat at. Libby has some of the best breakfast (can you say giant waffles!) and Sewall serves different dinners every night Monday-Friday.

There also a lot of things for people who like the outdoors to do (for example, hiking, skating, mountain climbing, biking, jogging, etc). There is actually a place for everyone because there are different schools and so many different student-fun clubs. You should visit the school if you haven't already, and you'll see that there are all different types of people that attend. Tips for prospective students For your first couple of days, you should carry a campus map around with you.

Once attending classes, like any other college, make sure that you talk with your professors because they will be the ones who can help you achieve both inside and outside of the classroom.

There are many things to do like hiking at Table Mesa, going to concerts, exploring The Hill, and enjoying the yearly Shakespeare Festival.', 'The University of Colorado Boulder is an incredible institution that allows students to challenge themselves academically while also allowing for time to be spent enjoying the fantastic Front Range city of Boulder. Out of the three colleges that I have attended, I have by far enjoyed CU Boulder the most due to the connections I have made with professors that have catapulted my academic career and the opportunities that studying here has afforded me.

Mitchell, who transferred from Arkansas in July, appeared in 21 games for the Razorbacks, but had played wide receiver in 2012.Ã‚Â  He was named the starter before the season opener with Louisiana Tech and led the Pack on three promising offensive series - two of which were 65 and 75 yard touchdown drives.Ã‚Â  He completed all three of this throws for a quick gain of 93 yards before a broken foot sent him to the sideline where he has remained for the past five games. Mitchell, who missed five games with a broken foot this season, led all rushers in the game with 105 yards on 21 carries and ran for a score.Ã‚Â  That yardage total was the most for a Wolfpack signal caller since Johnny Evans, now a color analyst for the Wolfpack Radio Network, had 126 against Duke in 1976. Brandon Mitchell did something against UNC that no Wolfpack quarterback had done in 37 years:Ã‚Â  rush for over 100 yards. Ã‚Â  Graduate quarterback MITCHELL","(DOWN THE) ROAD TRIP Fifty-six days into the 2013 football season, The Wolfpack left the state of North Carolina for a game when it traveled to Florida State to take on the No. 2 Seminoles on Oct. 26. Ã‚Â  NC State has played six games in Carter-Finley Stadium already in 2013 and although SaturdayÃ¢Â€Â™s game will mark the third road trip of the season, itÃ¢Â€Â™s the second that is just a short bus trip away (The WolfpackÃ¢Â€Â™s only previous road game before the trip to Tallahassee was the quick ride down I-40 to take on Wake Forest). Ã‚Â  The only other time the Pack will play a game outside of its home state this season will be on Nov. 16, when the squad heads north to take on Boston College. Ã‚Â  RUNNING UP The return of QB Brandon Mitchell into the PackÃ¢Â€Â™s lineup the last two weeks has added extra Ã¢Â€Â˜juiceÃ¢Â€Â™ to the running game. In the last two contests with Mitchell under center, the Pack has averaged 218.0 rushing yards as a team. In the five games prior that Mitchell was out with injury, the Pack rushed for 167.2 yards an outing. NC State has had back-to-back 100-yard rushers for the first time this season, Shadrach Thornton with 173 at FSU and Mitchell with 105 vs. UNC, and the Pack has gone over 200 yards as a team each of the last two contests. UNDERWOOD LOST FOR SEASON Another key",True,4,0,"{49721=NC STATE VS. DUKE The overall series between NC State and Duke is almost even, with the Blue Devils posting a 40-36-5 advantage.Ã‚Â  Since 1924, the two teams have faced off 81 times on the gridiron, playing every year except once during World War II (1944) until 2003, when ACC expansion caused a break in the series. Since 1963, however, the Wolfpack holds a 29-11-3 advantage against Duke. NC State has also won 11 of the last 12 meetings - and 14 of 16 dating back to 1990.Ã‚Â  Duke won the last meeting, posting a 49-28 win in Raleigh on Oct. 10, 2009, but NC State has won the last six matchups at Wallace Wade Stadium. CLOSE QUARTERS The distance between Wallace Wade Stadium and Carter-Finley Stadium is only about 20 miles, but the distance between scores when the two teams play is usually even less. Twelve of the last 19 contests between NC State and Duke have been decided by eight points or less, with seven being decided by three or less points (that includes a tie in 1988). And even though NC State has won 11 or the last 12 meetings between the two schools, seven of those victories were by a touchdown or less. INJURIES POUND PACK The Wolfpack entered the season with just 11 returning starters - one of the lowest totals in the nation.Ã‚Â  Since then, State has been bitten hard by the injury bug, with a whopping total of 27 games already missed by players who were listed as starters coming into the season. Ã‚Â  Of those games missed, 21 have come on the offensive side of the ball.Ã‚Â  In addition, another seven games have been missed by key skill players on offense.Ã‚Â  The quarterback and wide receiver positions have been hit especially hard, as QBs have missed six total games and wide receivers have missed seven.Ã‚Â  Starting wideout Bryan Underwood and freshman receiver Johnathan Alston are both out for the remainder of the season. HereÃ¢Â€Â™s a look at the games missed by key Pack players in 2013 (preseason starters denoted by *):, 61149=(DOWN THE) ROAD TRIP Fifty-six days into the 2013 football season, The Wolfpack left the state of North Carolina for a game when it traveled to Florida State to take on the No. 2 Seminoles on Oct. 26.

UNDERWOOD LOST FOR SEASON Another key player who will miss the rest of the season due to injury is speedy junior wideout Bryan Underwood. In the PackÃ¢Â€Â™s first three games of 2013, Underwood caught eight passes for a total of 56 yards and did not have any rushing attempts. But over the next four games, UnderwoodÃ¢Â€Â™s role in the offense has grown dramatically. Underwood was the PackÃ¢Â€Â™s leading receiver in three of those four outings, pulling in 24 catches for 326 yards. He has saw an increased role in the ground game - in the last five games he played, he has rushed 12 times for 135 yards., 49280=Nov. 7, 2013, 49484=Game 9: NC State Wolfpack vs. Duke Blue Devils November 9, 2013 Ã¢Â€Â¢ 4:00 p.m. Ã¢Â€Â¢ ESPNU Durham, N.C.

XSS Prevention Rules Summary Preventing all XSS flaws in an application is hard, as you can see. To help mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw on your site, OWASP also recommends you set the HTTPOnly flag on your session cookie and any custom cookies you have that are not accessed by any Javascript you wrote. This cookie flag is typically on by default in .NET apps, but in other languages you have to set it manually. For more details on the HTTPOnly cookie flag, including what it does, and how to use it, see the OWASP article on HTTPOnly. Bonus Rule: Use HTTPOnly cookie flag For details on what DOM-based XSS is, and defenses against this type of XSS flaw, please see the OWASP article on DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.
