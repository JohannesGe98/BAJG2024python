La investigaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ muestra que la violencia letal e impune contra los periodistas con frecuencia lleva a una autocensura generalizada en el resto de los medios de prensa. Desde Somalia hasta MÃƒÂ©xico, el CPJ ha encontrado que los periodistas evitan la cobertura de temas sensibles, abandonan la profesiÃƒÂ³n o incluso dejan sus paÃƒÂ­ses de origen para huir de la violencia en represalia por su trabajo., 25050=De los 13 paÃƒÂ­ses incluidos en el ÃƒÂ­ndice de 2011, Rusia ha hecho un progreso considerable, segÃƒÂºn la investigaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ. Funcionarios de investigaciÃƒÂ³n de alto rango reabrieron varios casos de asesinatos de periodistas no resueltos luego de una reuniÃƒÂ³n con una delegaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ en 2010, y, en abril, las autoridades consiguieron condenas en el asesinato de la reportera Anastasiya Baburova, ocurrido en MoscÃƒÂº en 2009., 2748=El Ãƒ?ndice de Impunidad del CPJ calcula el nÃƒÂºmero de asesinatos de periodistas no resueltos como un porcentaje en relaciÃƒÂ³n con la poblaciÃƒÂ³n del paÃƒÂ­s. Para este ÃƒÂ­ndice, el CPJ examinÃƒÂ³ asesinatos de periodistas ocurridos entre el 1 de enero de 2001 y el 31 de diciembre de 2010, que permanecÃƒÂ­an sin resolver. Solo aquellas naciones con cinco o mÃƒÂ¡s casos sin resolver fueron incluidas en este ÃƒÂ­ndice., 5019=Brasil ha ingresado y salido del Ãƒ?ndice de Impunidad del CPJ en los ÃƒÂºltimos cuatro aÃƒÂ±os, lo que refleja antecedentes desiguales en el combate de asesinatos de periodistas. Aunque las autoridades han investigado y enjuiciado a un nÃƒÂºmero considerable de asesinos de periodistas, aÃƒÂºn existe una violencia persistente contra la prensa. Brasil vuelve al ÃƒÂ­ndice este aÃƒÂ±o por el asesinato del periodista de radio Francisco Gomes de Medeiros en octubre de 2010. El caso de Gomes se convirtiÃƒÂ³ en el quinto asesinato no resuelto en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada en Brasil. Pero las autoridades parecen estar haciendo progresos en el caso, mediante la captura del supuesto asesino y autor intelectual, Ã‚Â elevando las expectativas de que el caso podrÃƒÂ­a ser resuelto., 17548=Altos funcionarios judiciales se reunieron con el CPJ en 2010 para tratar el problema de la impunidad, con la promesa del Presidente Aquino de revertir la falta de castigo para los responsables de crÃƒÂ­menes contra la prensa. Pero los funcionarios filipinos tambiÃƒÂ©n reconocieron que se trata de una tarea difÃƒÂ­cil en un paÃƒÂ­s donde 56 periodistas han sido asesinados en forma impune en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada. El proceso judicial contra decenas de acusados en la masacre de Maguindanao ocurrida en 2009, en la que 32 periodistas y trabajadores de prensa fueron asesinados, refleja un sistema ya generalizado en el que las autoridades suelen identificar a sospechosos pero raramente obtienen condenas. Los primeros procedimientos judiciales por la matanza de Maguindanao han estado plagados de amenazas y sobornos a los testigos, asÃƒÂ­ como de incompetencia y corrupciÃƒÂ³n entre los investigadores. La lenta investigaciÃƒÂ³n y enjuiciamiento no han permitido obtener ninguna condena hasta el momento. Mientras tanto, la violencia letal continÃƒÂºa: los reporteros de radio Joselito Agustin y Desidario Camangyan fueron asesinados en 2010 luego de informar sobre corrupciÃƒÂ³n local., 18819=Con 10 asesinatos no resueltos en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada, Somalia tiene el peor puntaje en Ãƒ?frica, y ocupa el segundo lugar a nivel mundial. Las vÃƒÂ­ctimas incluyen a Sheikh Nur Mohamed Abkey, quien fue torturado y baleado en varias ocasiones en mayo de 2010. Militantes de Al-Shabaab se atribuyeron responsabilidad por el asesinato de Abkey, uno de los periodistas mÃƒÂ¡s reconocidos del paÃƒÂ­s, en represalia por su trabajo en la emisora estatal Radio Mogadishu. El nivel de impunidad de Somalia es un elemento del devastado ÃƒÂ¡mbito mediÃƒÂ¡tico: cerca de 60 periodistas somalÃƒÂ­es han abandonado el paÃƒÂ­s por amenazas en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada, segÃƒÂºn la investigaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ. Aquellos que siguen en el periodismo extreman los mecanismos de autocensura para sobrevivir., 6267=Los niveles de impunidad de Bangladesh han mejorado ligeramente, reflejando su quinto aÃƒÂ±o consecutivo sin asesinatos de periodistas. Pero las autoridades no han producido resultado alguno en el esclarecimiento de los cinco asesinatos de periodistas ocurridos en la primera mitad de la dÃƒÂ©cada. Todas las vÃƒÂ­ctimas eran reporteros de prensa escrita que cubrÃƒÂ­an temas locales de corrupciÃƒÂ³n y crimen. Entre ellos estaba Nahar Ali, corresponsal del diario Anirban escrito en bengalÃƒÂ­, quien muriÃƒÂ³ en abril de 2001 por heridas recibidas dÃƒÂ­as anteriores cuando enmascarados lo secuestraron, golpearon y apuÃƒÂ±alaron. Periodistas locales aseguraron que el asesinato de Ali estuvo vinculado con su cobertura sobre corrupciÃƒÂ³n en la policÃƒÂ­a y grupos criminales locales. Hasta la actualidad, las autoridades no han realizado arresto alguno., 9137=NingÃƒÂºn periodista fue asesinado en represalia por su trabajo en 2010, el primer aÃƒÂ±o desde 1999 donde el CPJ no documentÃƒÂ³ un asesinato que tenga a la prensa como blanco en Rusia. Al mismo tiempo, autoridades consiguieron condenas en el doble crimen de 2009 de la reportera Anastasiya Baburova y el abogado de derechos humanos Stanislav Markelov. Pero esos asesinatos, cometidos en una calle del centro de MoscÃƒÂº por dos nacionalistas radicales, serÃƒÂ­an mÃƒÂ¡s fÃƒÂ¡ciles de investigar que los 16 casos no resueltos de la ÃƒÂºltima dÃƒÂ©cada. Estos incluyen el asesinato por encargo de los periodistas de investigaciÃƒÂ³n Anna Politkovskaya y Paul Klebnikov; el secuestro seguido de asesinato de Natalya Estemirova, quien cubrÃƒÂ­a cuestiones vinculadas con derechos humanos en la volÃƒÂ¡til regiÃƒÂ³n del Norte del CÃƒÂ¡ucaso; y el misterioso envenenamiento del editor del periÃƒÂ³dico crÃƒÂ­tico Yuri Shchekochikhin. En reuniones con una delegaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ en septiembre de 2010, altos funcionarios de seguridad aseguraron que reexaminarÃƒÂ­an cinco casos de asesinatos de periodistas, e informaron sobre progresos en el asesinato de Politkovskaya y otros casos., 27928=El Ãƒ?ndice Anual de Impunidad del CPJ, publicado por primera vez en 2008, identifica a los paÃƒÂ­ses donde los periodistas son asesinados regularmente y los gobiernos fracasan en su intento por resolver los crÃƒÂ­menes. Para esta ÃƒÂºltima ediciÃƒÂ³n del ÃƒÂ­ndice, el CPJ examinÃƒÂ³ los asesinatos de periodistas que ocurrieron entre el 1 de enero de 2001 y el 31 de diciembre de 2010, y que continÃƒÂºan sin resolverse. SÃƒÂ³lo los 13 paÃƒÂ­ses que presentaron cinco o mÃƒÂ¡s casos no resueltos fueron incluidos en el ÃƒÂ­ndice. Los casos son considerados no resueltos cuando no se obtuvo condena alguna., 7393=Al menos 14 asesinatos de periodistas han quedado no resueltos entre 2001 y 2010. Las vÃƒÂ­ctimas incluyen a Misri Khan, un veterano reportero y lÃƒÂ­der de una asociaciÃƒÂ³n de periodistas local, quien recibiÃƒÂ³ mÃƒÂºltiples impactos de bala en septiembre de 2010 cuando entraba al edificio del club de prensa de Hangu, una volÃƒÂ¡til localidad cerca del borde afgano. Sus colegas indicaron que habÃƒÂ­a recibido amenazas de grupos militantes. En mayo de 2011, el Presidente Asif Ali Zardari se reuniÃƒÂ³ con una delegaciÃƒÂ³n del CPJ y asegurÃƒÂ³ que renovarÃƒÂ­a los esfuerzos en la investigaciÃƒÂ³n de casos no resueltos y que tomarÃƒÂ­a una actitud mÃƒÂ¡s activa en el combate de la violencia contra la prensa en general., 14446=HistÃƒÂ³ricamente conocido como uno de los lugares mÃƒÂ¡s peligrosos en el mundo para los periodistas, Colombia consigue un puntaje muy pobre en este ÃƒÂ­ndice. Sin embargo, este paÃƒÂ­s demostrÃƒÂ³ su cuarto aÃƒÂ±o consecutivo de mejoras, ya que la violencia letal contra la prensa ha disminuido y las autoridades han tenido cierto ÃƒÂ©xito en investigar y enjuiciar a los asesinos de periodistas. Pero mucho trabajo queda por hacer: once asesinatos de periodistas de la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada siguen sin resolverse. Entre ellos se encuentra el asesinato del editor de un periÃƒÂ³dico de MonterÃƒÂ­a, Clodomiro Castilla Ospino, quien fue baleado en marzo de 2010 luego de cubrir los vÃƒÂ­nculos entre los grupos paramilitares de derecha y polÃƒÂ­ticos locales. Los periodistas colombianos, particularmente aquellos que viven en las provincias, afirman que realizan su trabajo con temor y que con frecuencia se autocensuran., 12081=Seis reporteros locales y editores han sido asesinados con total impunidad en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada. Cuadros maoÃƒÂ­stas estÃƒÂ¡n sospechados en alguno de los crÃƒÂ­menes, incluyendo el asesinato de 2007 del reportero Birendra Shah, cuyo trabajo habÃƒÂ­a sido crÃƒÂ­tico de lo que fue entonces un levantamiento armado maoÃƒÂ­sta. Luego de unirse al gobierno en 2008, lÃƒÂ­deres maoÃƒÂ­stas reclamaron que se investigaran las numerosas violaciones a la libertad de prensa que se habÃƒÂ­a adjudicado a sus miembros, incluyendo varios ataques sin vÃƒÂ­ctimas fatales y secuestros. Sin embargo, no se evidenciÃƒÂ³ progreso alguno en la imparticiÃƒÂ³n de justicia., 20818=A continuaciÃƒÂ³n se detallan los 13 paÃƒÂ­ses donde los periodistas son asesinados en forma recurrente y los gobiernos no pueden o no quieren investigar y enjuiciar a los culpables. El ÃƒÂ­ndice cubre el perÃƒÂ­odo comprendido entre los aÃƒÂ±os 2001 y 2010., 1524=El CPJ consultÃƒÂ³ a Mary Gray, profesora de MatemÃƒÂ¡ticas y EstadÃƒÂ­stica de la American University en Washington, cuando desarrollÃƒÂ³ inicialmente su metodologÃƒÂ­a en 2008. Gray ha participado en juntas directivas y comitÃƒÂ©s de organizaciones como AmnistÃƒÂ­a Internacional. En 2001, Gray recibiÃƒÂ³ el Premio Presidencial por Excelencia en Ciencias, MatemÃƒÂ¡ticas e IngenierÃƒÂ­a Consultiva., 25764=En MÃƒÂ©xico, el gobierno del Presidente Felipe CalderÃƒÂ³n Hinojosa ha adoptado algunas reformas generales -fortaleciendo la oficina de la fiscalÃƒÂ­a especial para crÃƒÂ­menes contra la libertad de expresiÃƒÂ³n, por un lado--pero los fiscales aÃƒÂºn fracasan en su intento por obtener condenas en un sistema legal plagado de corrupciÃƒÂ³n. En Filipinas, el Presidente Benigno Aquino ha asegurado que enjuiciarÃƒÂ­a a todos los responsables de la masacre de decenas periodistas y otras personas en la provincia de Maguindanao ocurrida en 2009. Pero los procedimientos judiciales han sido largamente estropeados por amenazas y sobornos contra los testigos del caso., 29281=Colombia continuÃƒÂ³ con el progreso que se verifica desde hace varios aÃƒÂ±os, segÃƒÂºn el ÃƒÂ­ndice del CPJ, mientras que las condiciones en Bangladesh reflejaron una ligera mejorÃƒÂ­a. En cambio, los paÃƒÂ­ses que encabezan el ÃƒÂ­ndice -Irak, Somalia y Filipinas--no exhibieron mejoras ni peores antecedentes. Irak, con un nivel de impunidad tres veces peor que cualquier otro paÃƒÂ­s, estÃƒÂ¡ posicionado primero por cuarto aÃƒÂ±o consecutivo. AÃƒÂºn cuando el fuego cruzado y otras muertes relacionadas con el conflicto armado han disminuido en Irak en los ÃƒÂºltimos aÃƒÂ±os, los asesinatos de periodistas se incrementaron en 2010., 13038=AfganistÃƒÂ¡n se encuentra estÃƒÂ¡tico en el ÃƒÂ­ndice, sin nuevos asesinatos documentados, pero sin haber obtenido condenas en ninguno de los siete casos no resueltos de la ÃƒÂºltima dÃƒÂ©cada. Los casos no resueltos incluyen el asesinato de Abdul Samad Rohani en 2008, reportero del servicio de noticias del la BBC en Pashto y colaborador de la agencia de noticias Pajhwok Afghan News. Rohani recibiÃƒÂ³ mÃƒÂºltiples balazos cerca de Lashkar Gah, capital de la provincia de Helmand, luego de informar sobre supuestos vÃƒÂ­nculos entre narcotraficantes y funcionarios del gobierno., 3801=Con siete asesinatos relacionados con la prensa aÃƒÂºn sin resolver y una ausencia aparente de Ã‚Â voluntad polÃƒÂ­tica para esclarecerlos, India retiene su puesto en el ÃƒÂ­ndice de impunidad del CPJ. Las vÃƒÂ­ctimas incluyen al reportero Prahlad Goala, quien fue asesinado en 2006 en el noreste del estado de Assam luego de escribir una serie de artÃƒÂ­culos sobre corrupciÃƒÂ³n en el servicio forestal local. La policÃƒÂ­a arrestÃƒÂ³ a un funcionario del servicio inmediatamente despuÃƒÂ©s del crimen, pero lo liberÃƒÂ³ poco despuÃƒÂ©s. Otros sospechosos fueron luego apresados, pero no se obtuvo condena alguna., 20361=El flagelo de la impunidad empeorÃƒÂ³ en Irak, un paÃƒÂ­s con un nivel que por lejos lo coloca como el peor en el mundo. Ninguno de los 92 casos de periodistas asesinados y documentados en Irak en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada ha sido resuelto y, luego de una leve baja en casos de asesinatos de periodistas como blanco directo, los crÃƒÂ­menes de reporteros aumentaron en 2010. Entre las cuatro vÃƒÂ­ctimas de 2010 se encuentra Sardasht Osman, colaborador de varios medios, quien habÃƒÂ­a recibido numerosas amenazas por su cobertura sobre corrupciÃƒÂ³n de funcionarios del gobierno regional de KurdistÃƒÂ¡n. La investigaciÃƒÂ³n de su asesinato es un ejemplo claro de la arraigada cultura de la impunidad en Irak. Las autoridades no tomaron acciÃƒÂ³n alguna en el caso hasta enfrentar intensa presiÃƒÂ³n internacional. Solo entonces, los investigadores elaboraron un somero informe de 430 palabras en el que vagamente se acusaba a Osman de tener vÃƒÂ­nculos con un grupo extremista que condujo a su asesinato. El informe, que fue citado sin evidencia que fundamentara sus aseveraciones, fue denunciado abiertamente por carecer de credibilidad y transparencia., 491=Asesinatos de periodistas no resueltos por cada millÃƒÂ³n de habitantes entre 2001 y 2010. Se incluyen naciones con cinco o mÃƒÂ¡s casos no resueltos. Los casos son considerados no resueltos cuando no se obtuvo condena alguna., 15971=El Presidente Mahinda Rajapaksa ha presidido una dÃƒÂ©cada negra de asesinatos con los medios como blanco de ataque y un rotundo fracaso de los organismos de seguridad para resolver los crÃƒÂ­menes. Los nueve periodistas asesinados en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada permanecen sin resolver, dejando abierta la pregunta sobre si las autoridades han sido cÃƒÂ³mplices en algunos de los crÃƒÂ­menes. Para ilustrar el problema cabe mencionar el asesinato de Lasantha Wickramatunga en 2009, quien como uno de los editores lÃƒÂ­deres del paÃƒÂ­s era un reconocido crÃƒÂ­tico de las polÃƒÂ­ticas del gobierno. Wickramatunga fue asesinado a golpes por un grupo de asaltantes en motocicletas en una calle transitada en los barrios bajos de Colombo en la maÃƒÂ±ana de un dÃƒÂ­a de semana. El gobierno organizÃƒÂ³ audiencias de investigaciÃƒÂ³n sin conseguir progreso alguno en la captura de sospechosos. Tal como escribiÃƒÂ³ la esposa de Wickramatunga, Sonali Samarasinghe, en el blog del CPJ: ""El gobierno ha bloqueado la investigaciÃƒÂ³n al pasarla como una papa caliente de un ÃƒÂ³rgano de investigaciÃƒÂ³n a otro""., 11033=El nivel de impunidad de MÃƒÂ©xico ha empeorado por tercer aÃƒÂ±o consecutivo. Al menos 13 asesinatos de periodistas han quedado sin resolver en la dÃƒÂ©cada pasada en medio de corrupciÃƒÂ³n generalizada en gobiernos locales y organismos de seguridad. En 2010, hombres armados asesinaron a Luis Carlos Santiago, fotÃƒÂ³grafo del periÃƒÂ³dico El Diario de Ciudad JuÃƒÂ¡rez, en el estacionamiento de un centro comercial en la tarde de un dÃƒÂ­a de semana. El asesinato se produjo dos aÃƒÂ±os despuÃƒÂ©s de que el reportero de la crÃƒÂ³nica policÃƒÂ­aca de El Diario, Armando RodrÃƒÂ­guez CarreÃƒÂ³n, fuera baleado frente a su pequeÃƒÂ±a hija. Los asesinatos llevaron al periÃƒÂ³dico a reducir Ã‚Â la cobertura sobre narcotrÃƒÂ¡fico y crimen, poniendo de manifiesto los efectos devastadores de la violencia impune contra la prensa en MÃƒÂ©xico. El CPJ documentÃƒÂ³ la impunidad en MÃƒÂ©xico en un informe especial de 2010, Silencio o Muerte en la Prensa Mexicana, y una delegaciÃƒÂ³n obtuvo promesas de reforma por parte del Presidente CalderÃƒÂ³n. Pero mientras la fiscalÃƒÂ­a especial ha sido reforzada, otras reformas propuestas -incluyendo la federalizaciÃƒÂ³n de crÃƒÂ­menes contra la prensa--se mueven lentamente., 28574=""Los hallazgos del Ãƒ?ndice de Impunidad de 2011 revelan las descarnadas opciones que enfrentan los gobiernos: o encaran de frente el problema de la violencia contra periodistas o bien observan cÃƒÂ³mo los asesinatos continÃƒÂºan y la autocensura se extiende"", asegurÃƒÂ³ el director ejecutivo del CPJ, Joel Simon. ""Las condenas en Rusia son un signo esperanzador luego de aÃƒÂ±os de indiferencia y negaciÃƒÂ³n. La situaciÃƒÂ³n en MÃƒÂ©xico, en cambio, es profundamente incierta, con niveles de violencia creciente mientras el gobierno promete acciÃƒÂ³n pero no concreta""., 21591=El CPJ lanza su Ãƒ?ndice de Impunidad de 2011 durante la 17Ã‚Âª reuniÃƒÂ³n general del Intercambio Internacional por la Libertad de ExpresiÃƒÂ³n (IFEX, por sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s) en Beirut, que reÃƒÂºne a defensores de la libertad de prensa alrededor del mundo. El Ãƒ?ndice de Impunidad del CPJ estÃƒÂ¡ compilado como parte de la CampaÃƒÂ±a Global contra la Impunidad de la organizaciÃƒÂ³n. Apoyada por la FundaciÃƒÂ³n John S. y James L. Knight, la campaÃƒÂ±a se centra en dos de los paÃƒÂ­ses mÃƒÂ¡s peligrosos para la prensa: Rusia y Filipinas., 1793=Los casos son considerados no resueltos cuando no se obtuvo condena alguna. Los datos de poblaciÃƒÂ³n de los Indicadores Mundiales para el Desarrollo de 2009 del Banco Mundial fueron utilizados para calcular el puntaje de cada paÃƒÂ­s.}"

Notes The OpenCL specification in section 9.7 defines how to share data with texture and buffer objects in a parallel OpenGL implementation, but does not define how the association between an OpenCL context and an OpenGL context or share group is established. This extension defines optional attributes to OpenCL context creation routines which associate a GL context or share group object with a newly created OpenCL context. If this extension is supported by an implementation, the string ""cl_khr_gl_sharing"" will be present in the CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS or CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS string described in the table of allowed values for param_name for clGetDeviceInfo. An OpenGL implementation supporting buffer objects and sharing of texture and buffer object images with OpenCL is required by this extension. OpenCL device(s) corresponding to an OpenGL context may be queried. Such a device may not always exist (for example, if an OpenGL context is specified on a GPU not supporting OpenCL command queues, but which does support shared CL/GL objects), and if it does exist, may change over time. When such a device does exist, acquiring and releasing shared CL/GL objects may be faster on a command queue corresponding to this device",False,-1,0,"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 22:52:57 GMT",,

This rule is effective May 23, 2016. 21 CFR Parts 606, 610, 630, 640, 660, and 820 Summary The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations applicable to blood and blood components, including Source Plasma, to make the donor eligibility and testing requirements more consistent with current practices in the blood industry, to more closely align the regulations with current FDA recommendations, and to provide flexibility to accommodate advancing technology. In order to better assure the safety of the nation's blood supply and to help protect donor health, FDA is revising the requirements for blood establishments to test donors for infectious disease, and to determine that donors are eligible to donate and that donations are suitable for transfusion or further manufacture.
