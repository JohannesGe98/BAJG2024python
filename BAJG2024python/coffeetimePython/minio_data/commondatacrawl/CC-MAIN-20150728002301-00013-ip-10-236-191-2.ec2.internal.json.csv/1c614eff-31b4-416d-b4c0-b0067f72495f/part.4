This document contains corrections to the final regulations for Ã¢Â€ÂœUnlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Devices in the 5 GHz BandÃ¢Â€? that appeared in the Federal Register on May 1, 2014 (79 FR 24569)., 95810=The Commission published in the Federal Register of December 10, 2014, a document concerning an Order on Reconsideration ( Order ) affirming the Commission's commitment to ensuring that high quality telephone service must be available to all Americans. In the Order, the Commission established rules to combat extensive problems with successfully completing calls to rural areas, and created a framework to improve the ability to monitor call problems and take appropriate enforcement action. In the Order, the Commission denies several petitions for reconsideration that, if granted, would impair the Commission's ability to monitor, and take enforcement action against, call completion problems. The Commission does, however, grant one petition for reconsideration because the Commission finds that modifying its original determination will significantly lower providers' compliance costs and burdens without impairing the Commission's ability to obtain reliable and extensive information about rural call completion problems., 765524=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KCEB License Company, LLC (Ã¢Â€ÂœKCEB LicenseÃ¢Â€?), the licensee of KCEB(TV), channel 51, Longview, Texas, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Longview. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. KCEB License has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 26 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 378322=The Audio Division, at the request of Bryan Broadcasting License Corporation, substitutes Channel 274A for vacant Channel 267A at Centerville, Texas, and grant the Application for Station KKEE, Centerville, Texas, File No. BMPH-20140324ADD. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 274A can be allotted to Centerville, Texas consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) east of Centerville. The reference coordinates are 31-15-00 NL and 95-56-00 WL., 509569=The Auction 1000 Request for Comment initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals.

This document announces an effective date for several sections in the final regulations that appeared in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014 (79 FR 48442)., 415861=The Audio Division, at the request of JER Licenses, LLC, substitute alternative Channel 281C for vacant Channel 280C at Toquerville, Utah to accommodate the Ã¢Â€ÂœhybridÃ¢Â€? application that requests the downgrade of the new FM station from Channel 281C3 to Channel 280A at Peach Springs, Arizona. A staff engineering analysis confirms that Channel 281C can be allotted to Toquerville, Utah consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Rules without a site restriction. The reference coordinates for Channel 281C at Toquerville are 37-15-12 NL and 113-17-00 WL. See Supplementary Info. supra., 363557=The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that a certain rule adopted in its Public Safety 700 MHz Narrowband proceeding (WT Docket No. 96-86; FCC 00-348 and FCC 01-10) between 2000 and 2001, to the extent it contained an information collection requirement that required approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was approved, and became effective August 21, 2014, following approval by OMB., 492873=On December 23, 2014, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau published a document seeking updated input to better understand the current consumer experience with hearing aid compatible wireless handsets, to explore technical or other barriers to the provision of hearing aid compatible devices on new wireless technologies, and to consider changes to its rules that may be necessary to ensure that wireless handsets used with advanced communications services are accessible in light of directives contained in the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA).

The rule changes also apply to future filings made in existing Section 208 formal complaints and pole attachment complaints. In addition, the amendments make a few procedural changes to existing Section 208 formal complaint and pole attachment complaint filing rules to create uniformity among them and ease of administration for parties and staff when initiating service of pleadings or filing confidential matters with the Commission. The rules further establish a single electronic inbox within Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) to handle the initial filing of the above-identified new complaints. Accepted complaints will receive a distinct ECFS docket number; rejected complaints will remain on ECFS but will be stored within the Inbox., 478350=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 266590=On July 23, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) released a document which contained information collection requirements for the schools and libraries universal service mechanism (E-rate) which required approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted approval on October 27, 2014, under emergency processing for certain of the information collection requirements contained in the Report and Order as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520)., 626777=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Charles Crawford, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Section 73.202(b) of the Commission's Rules, by allotting Channel 295A at Wright City, Oklahoma, as the community's first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 295A can be allotted to Wright City consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 14 kilometers (8.6 miles) east of the community. The reference coordinates are 34-04-44 NL and 94-51-15 WL., 355097=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years, the information collection associated with the Commission's Report and Order, 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review, FCC 14-28. This notice is consistent with the Report and Order, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the requirements., 42411=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years, the information collection requirements associated with the Commission's Report and Order for Commercial Operations in the 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz Bands (Service Rules for Advance Wireless Service (AWS)), FCC 14-31. This notice is consistent with the Report and Order, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the new or modified information collection requirements., 71004=At the request of Chris Samples Broadcasting, Inc., licensee of Station KXDJ(FM), Channel 252C2, Spearman, Texas, the Audio Division amends the FM Table of Allotments, by substituting Channel 221A for vacant Channel 252A at Silverton, Texas to accommodate the Application that requests to upgrade the facilities of Station KXDJ(FM) from Channel 252C2 to Channel 252C1 at Spearman, Texas.

A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 221A can be allotted to Silverton, Texas consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) east of Silverton. The reference coordinates are 34-28-15 NL and 101-13-09 WL., 602459=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by WLAJ-TV LLC, the licensee of station WLAJ-TV, channel 51, Lansing, Michigan, requesting the substitution of channel 25 for channel 51 at Lansing. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. WLAJ-TV LLC has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 25 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 383438=In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years, an information collection associated with the Commission's Report and Order, FCC 13-158, published at 79 FR 3123 on January 17, 2014, and at 79 FR 7589 on February 10, 2014. This notice is consistent with the Report and Order, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval and the effective date of requirements subject to OMB approval. Specifically, this document announces the effective date of initial and annual reliability certification requirements for covered 911 service providers, including any associated record retention requirements., 435835=In this document, the Commission proposes to expand to cable operators, satellite TV providers, broadcast radio licensees, and satellite radio licensees the requirement that public inspection files be posted to the FCC's online database. In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 582533=In this document the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) affirms core principles guiding its approach to 911 governance and proposes mechanisms to ensure, in cooperation with state and local partners, that the nation's 911 governance structure keeps pace with evolving technology so that all entities providing 911 service capabilities remain accountable for reliable 911 call completion and accurate situational awareness. This document proposes steps to address vulnerabilities in 911 reliability that have been revealed by a series of recent Ã¢Â€Âœsunny dayÃ¢Â€? 911 outages, including the April 2014 multi-state outage that was the subject of a recent report by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau). Specifically, this document proposes to amend the Commission's 911 reliability certification rules to cover additional entities and network reliability practices; require public notification for major changes in multi-state 911 networks and services, and Commission approval for discontinuance of existing 911 services; require entities seeking to provide new 911 capabilities to certify as to their technical and operational capability to provide reliable service; and designate certain 911 service providers to take lead responsibility for situational awareness and coordination with other service providers in the event of a 911 outage., 558270=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Ã‚Â§ 73.202(b) of the Commission's rules, by allotting Channel 277A at Shelter Island, New York, as a first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 277A can be allotted to Shelter Island consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules with a site restriction located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of the community. The reference coordinates are 40-57-54 NL and 72-22-59 WL., 32429=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) takes the next critical steps to modernize the Universal Service Fund's Schools and Libraries program, known as E-rate. Building on the E-rate Modernization Order, the Commission adopted in July, the improvements to the program that the Commission adopts in this Order seek to close the high-speed connectivity gap between rural schools and libraries and their urban and suburban counterparts, and provide sufficient and certain funding for high-speed connectivity to and within all eligible schools and libraries. The Commission takes these actions to ensure the continued success of the E-rate program as it transitions from supporting legacy services to focusing on meeting the high-speed broadband connectivity needs of schools and libraries consistent with the recently adopted program goals and long-term connectivity targets. In the Order on Reconsideration, the Commission grants in part the petitions for reconsideration of the areas designated as urban for purposes of the E-rate program. The Commission also denies petitions for reconsideration of the document retention period, the phase out of support for telephone components and other services, and funding commitments that cover multiple years. At the same time, the Commission clarifies our cost effectiveness test for individual data plans and the cost allocation rules for circuits carrying voice services., 236907=In this document the Commission implements certain changes to the rules governing the 700 MHz public safety narrowband spectrum (769-775/799-805 MHz). We eliminate the requirement for licensees to narrowband to 6.25 kHz technology by December 2016, thereby enabling licensees to extend the life of existing systems and providing public safety with greater flexibility in determining the optimal future use of the band. In addition, we revise and update the technical rules for the band to enhance interoperability and open up certain channels to new uses, and we release reserve spectrum to provide additional capacity, particularly for public safety licensees relocating to the 700 MHz band from the T-Band (470-512 MHz). These rule changes enhance the ability of public safety licensees to use this spectrum to protect the safety of life and property., 121882=In this document, the Commission announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved on December 5, 2014, for a period for three years, a revision to an information collection for the FCC Application for Radio Service Authorization for the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, FCC Form 601. With this document, the Commission is announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the revised requirements for FCC Form 601.}",{998=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01}

TrueCar also includes manufacturer preparation charges (manufacturer charges to the dealer to cover any work done on the car prior to delivering it to the dealership) and fuel charges (the charge for the fuel in the tank when the buyer purchases the vehicle) in this total.

It provides a statistically accurate understanding of what other buyers are paying for the vehicle you have selected and as you have configured it. Adjustments to the calculation beyond make, model, and trim are normalized based on detailed, anonymized transaction information. This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold vehicles included different option combinations than your specified vehicle configuration. The data underlying the Average Paid calculation are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices.
