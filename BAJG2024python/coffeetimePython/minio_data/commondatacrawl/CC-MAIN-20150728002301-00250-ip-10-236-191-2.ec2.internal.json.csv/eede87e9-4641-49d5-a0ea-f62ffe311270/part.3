There are groups to suit a myriad of different interests, and you can always find posters for events and opportunities plastering your nearest wall or cork board. Finally, at the college one thing we do not lack is green space. If you are looking to take a stroll, or perhaps indulge in some Ultimate Frisbee, there are spots all over campus to fulfill those needs. Careful though, you might make a few friends in the process!', 'While we do not have very many places to eat on campus, the main cafeteria is excellent about serving up a variety of different cuisines each week. One popular item are the Pho noodles, a Vietnamese creation where you can add on things to round out your bowl. It creates a hearty, slightly colorful option to delight your stomach. Off campus however, there are endless options both within walking distance or in the radius of a short drive. One thing is for sure - whatever you have a hankering for, you are more than likely to find it close by.', ""Being a community college, there are no actual dorms. However, this factor does not cancel out the fact that around the school is a vibrant college-centric community. Many students live nearby, and businesses all around are filled with study haunts that host these academics on a regular basis. Even on the campus itself there are so many places where one can go to learn or to relax in between their educational regime. There are always exciting things going on, and perhaps because of the size of our school, we're more invested in keeping the days fresh and lively. People routinely spend all day on campus even when they have only one, perhaps two classes, because there are many activities to pursue."", 'Forget about any pop culture references about community colleges being a playground for those between high school and adult life, or as a mere stepping stone to a four-year university. Classes here will make you keep pace with any university student, but all the more to your benefit, in certain ways you will surpass them. At a smaller institution you will be subject to closer teacher to student interaction, as well as a tight knit community of faculty and other students who all share your values and dreams. Tacoma Community College is a place where hard work is valued and encouraged, and their classes reflect that. We strive for excellence here.', 'One of the most important things that I would suggest to incoming students is quite simply - take it seriously. Be on the ball with deadlines, be proactive with coming to class every day, seeing your counselor each new quarter for academic advising, use the resources at your fingertips. The faculty here want to help you, and we have some of the most impressive professors here who are dedicated and open about their work. If you open yourself up to the possibilities, you will surely succeed.', 'Tacoma Community College is truly a jewel among community institutions, defying any and all negative stereotypes.

Source The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations, subject to the approval of the President, necessary for the administration of this section insofar as this section affects employees in or under an Executive agency. (c) To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an agency shall schedule the time to be spent by an employee in a travel status away from his official duty station within the regularly scheduled workweek of the employee.

The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 ( 63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviserÃ¢Â€Â™s note for section 301.

Nice brace for the money. I previously owned Asterisks before these and I'd say they are comparable. I prefer how thin and narrow the pods are but wish they offered more patella protection. When your knee is bent there is little protection from roost/rocks., 49038=Comments On Jul 25, 2012:these are great knee braces they fit very well and are very comfy seem like they will protect the knee very well., 43373=Comments On Apr 22, 2013:I have had these braces for a year. My knees are not blown, I just got these to protect them. This is the only pair of knee braces I have owned. They are light, slim, and comfortable. I recommend them for anyone looking at braces. After a year the straps are getting a little worn. The little pad that velcros on is lost on most straps. I'll probably need to get a replacement set of straps this year. The plastic now has a couple of small chips in it. I'm not really sure how, but they do get used a lot. I have some small holes in my pants from the braces rubbing on the leather. I'm not sure that is avoidable with braces. I have had several times where I put my foot down hard and I think these probably protected my knees. I feel a lot better wearing these rather than knee pads., 61359=Ã‚Â© 2015 Ã‚Â  Rocky Mountain ATV, Inc. All rights reserved.

The retainer is plastic, not very well designed for an area that will obviously receive impact. I haven't crashed where the knee cup would have taken a severe impact, now I have doubts that in a severe crash the knee cup would provide adiquate protection. There was no warrantee offered on the product., 47359=Comments On Feb 19, 2013:First day out these were a little tight and a little painful. I guess that's the break-in period because after that, they have been great. Good flex, good support and pretty comfortable., 31596=Comments On May 06, 2015:I am surprsied to read so many negative reviews on RM for these knee braces. I am 40 and a lifetime of fun has pretty much wrecked my right knee, it's been broken, rebroken, poked at, stuff pulled out of it, ACL completely torn now, etc etc. I picked a pair of these up last summer after spending 2 weeks on crutches yet again from my knee giving out... never had a problem since. Pretty much every ride I feel them grip above and below the knee and take weight for me. I ride difficult enduro/single track twice a week and before these braces I'd be hobbling around with a sore knee at least once a month. 9+ months later of hard riding and I've never had that once. I also use them for snowmobiling. I smashed into a buried rock last winter and took the rock at speed squarely on the patella guard. It threw me right off the machine with the force of it but the guard did not snap or shatter and neither did my knee. Incredible! My only bad thing to say about the brace is that one of the screws in the synthetic ligaments came loose and I had to purchase the rebuild kit in order to replace the screw. Get the right sized alan key and make sure everything is tight every few rides! Also learn how to test and replace the ligaments once they wear out (which they eventually will). Overall: This is an incredible product at half the price of other braces providing this level of protection. If you are old, and your knees are trashed, consider treating yourself., 38271=Comments On Apr 09, 2014:Very first ride with these the whole patella cup snapped off and a strap separated (at the part where it tells you what number strap it is). Replaced it and just after that just about every piece of velcro fell off so I rubber cemented them on and they just keep falling off. Total waste of money and time. Get asterisks for cheaper, something that has a good history., 45669=Comments On Mar 31, 2013:I bought these because i needed support on my knee. I broke the bottom of the right one on my first ride. I replaced it and broke the second one in almost the same place on my second ride.}","Pod MX K300 Knee Brace Pair Sizing Chart 11 reviews 10 of Displaying Read All Reviews Was this review helpful?
