Liquid urethane is then poured into the mould, which is quickly shut and sealed. The urethane expands, hardens, and fuses with the coat of primer. The mould is then unlocked and opened, revealing a perfect duplicate of the original product, complete with a finished coat of primer. Ekena Millwork's urethane millwork line is made up of both standard industry designs as well as their own unique products. Each item begins with a finely crafted original master, which is then used to make several moulds. Ensuring only the highest quality products, each mould is consistently maintained and then immediately replaced if they show even the slightest signs of wear. This gives them the ability to guarantee that the detail of every product they create is as clean and crisp as the first. Available while supplies last.

The parking lots are not very large yet there are several emergency call buttons located throughout the parking lots. There are also several county and town police who make their rounds through the school everyday. I have been going to Kishwaukee College for almost 2 years and a day has not gone by that I have not seen a cop strolling the halls. Kishwaukee College has great emergency plans for any type of emergency that could occur and all students and staff are very aware of protocols. This makes for a very safe environment.', 'Kishwaukee College is a great school for students who are not quite ready for a university setting or students who are trying to get their gen-eds out of the way at a more affordable rate without sacrificing quality education. Kishwaukee College also has many older adults who are either returning to school or beginning their education later in life. Because there is a large number of these non-traditional students, older people do not have to feel awkward while attending college.', 'Kishwaukee College is great for its price. They have a nice, clean campus inside and out and a lot of options for classes. They also offer on-line classes. Printing and computer use is included with tuition which is nice because many colleges and universities charge extra to print. There is free wi-fi located throughout campus. The library also has many useful tools for research, all free with tuition.', 'As far at Kishwaukee College itself, get involved with clubs and organizations if you want to have fun. These clubs plan events on campus as well as volunteer opportunities off campus. However, Malta is a small rural town where there is not much in terms of entertainment. Dekalb is only about 6 miles east where NIU is located. There are many restaurants, some shopping, and a movie theater. The good news is that Kishwaukee College is only 65 miles west of Chicago so that makes for good weekend fun.', 'The Kish Cafe is great for variety of foods. It is in a brand new location of the school that just opened this year. There is a sub bar, salad bar, wrap bar, a grille, and a coffee shop. It is very affordable but the hours are slightly inconvenient. They close early in the afternoon most days.', 'Kishwaukee College is a community college and does not offer on-campus housing. Many of the students either live at home or are in an apartment or house. However, because the college is very close to Northern Illinois University, many students are enrolled at both schools and do live in the dorms. There are also private dorms in DeKalb, about 6 miles from Kishwaukee College campus that people can live in.', 'Kishwaukee College is a great school as a transition from high school to college. It is definitely not high school and is definitely not a university. Most of the instructors understand that many of the students are there to better prepare themselves for a university and are therefore, very available for help and questions. Most of the classes I have taken are 3 credit hour classes that require between 2 and 5 hours of outside work per week. However, watch out for the science department. Kishwaukee College prides itself on having a great nursing program and many of the science classes tend to be treated as a weed-out class for the nursing program. Plan to spend extra time, effort, and studying for many of the sciences, especially biology courses. They are very thorough and beneficial but they can be tough.', 'Be careful your first semester! Do not jump in over your head. College is a big change and it is best to go into it and give yourself time to adjust. This is from personal experience! Also, ask questions!! Everybody is there to help you and is completely willing. Often times, you will learn more than you were expecting just by asking a simple question. Also, get involved. There are many clubs and organizations that will provide you with a little bit of an outlet from the stress of school.', 'Kishwaukee College has continuously exceeded my expectations throughout the entire time I have been enrolled.

In general, the campus is far safer than the city. The biggest concern here is petty crime, which makes up about 90% of all crime in Vancouver. Violent crimes are extremely rare. The only time I have ever had a bad experience was when I lived off-campus in east Vancouver (the shady side of town).

It's also commonplace to complain about the constant building construction and rain."", ""UBC's tuition is reasonable as it goes for Canadian schools. However, the cost of living is quite steep if you choose to rent apartments or even live on upper-year residences. It's easy to get carried away on lavish expenses such as prepared food, so it's better to get disciplined sooner than later and start cooking for yourself. However, the educational experience in itself is worthwhile. There are options to travel abroad and undergo all sorts of enrichment - all of these can potentially be funded to minimize expenses to yourself."", 'UBC has its own Student Recreation Center, which hosts intramural sports and even gives lessons. These include yoga, basketball, badminton, soccer, and almost any sport you could imagine. There is also a fitness center and aquatic center for those needing to pump iron or go for a swim. UBC has its own on-campus pub called the Pit Pub, which offers cheap alcohol on Pit Wednesdays. In terms of attractions, UBC has a variety of gardens. The Nitobe Memorial Garden is a Japanese-style garden, the Rose Garden features roses, and the Botanical Garden features a wider variety of plants than either of these two. UBC also features a few museams, including the Museam of Anthropology, and the Beaty Biodiversity Museam (which features a full-size whale skeleton).', ""UBC offers a variety of on-campus dining options. For students living in residence, the cafeterias stock a variety of home-style options with entrees and sides. Beyond that, there's a selection of cookie-cutter cafes scattered across campus that sell a variety of soups, sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. The Student Union Building (SUB) has some more variety - including sushi, a deli, burgers, fast food, chinese food, korean food, pasta, Subway, and there are salad bars as well. A further stroll from campus leads to the University Village, where there are establishments such as Starbucks, Pizza, Sushi, McDonalds. A food court at the University Village has options for chinese food, vietnamese food, mediterranean food, and indian food. Wesbrook village, a short bus ride from campus, has a fully stocked grocery store, as well as options for taiwanese noodles and frozen yogurt. Of course, a bus ride into the neighboring suburbs of Vancouver has more extensive options. A longer ride into downtown opens up even more!"", ""UBC offers two first year residences - Totem Park and Place Vanier. Despite the ever-switching reputation of one dorm being the 'study dorm' and the other being the 'party dorm', both dormitories offer a thrill if you're up for one and some quiet study space if you're looking for it. Some of your closest friends will be formed on your residence floors, and your residence advisor will be there to guide you and help you with any problems that may arise. RezLife holds a variety of events through the school year, which are engaging both academically and socially, so it's a good idea to participate in as many as possible! The food in residences isn't so unbearable if you know what to buy and what you're looking for, and money isn't easily squandered if you have good self-control. Overall, 1st year residence is an amazing experience - it allows you to fulfill your social needs and be conveniently on campus. Upper year residences offer a wider selection of buildings. For housing during the school year, students draw in a residence lottery to determine who gets placed. There are choices between townhouse, apartment-style, or suite-style residences. There are also year-round housing options which are first-come, first-serve for students that aren't successful in the residence lottery. Dorm Life in these upper year residences tends to be equally close-knit, as all residences have RezLife staff, but your mileage may vary based on your roommates. Towers such as Marine Drive and Walter Gage towers can offer some breathtaking views!"", ""UBC offers a diverse range of courses, some with a reputation for being exceedingly easy, and others with a reputation for being notoriously difficult. There are the famed 'weeder classes', as well as the 'GPA boosters'. From my experience, no matter what class you end up taking, a good grade cannot be pulled without making sure you put the work into the course. Even GPA boosters can fall apart if no effort is applied, and the so-called 'weeder courses' can be triumphed over by putting in that extra effort by going to office hours or doing some past exams. You should overall be comfortable with the classes you're taking - avoid classes that seem too easy to prevent becoming complacent, and avoid classes that may be too challenging to take on all at once. UBC offers courses to suit many levels of students, so be sure to make your choice accordingly!"", ""Begin with the end in mind - even if you don't know what you want to accomplish by the end of university, chances are some of the courses, clubs, and activities you'll be a part of will help you realize that. Once you're set on your path, seek out as many opportunities to get involved in both academics and extracurriculars. UBC has an undergraduate student society for all of its faculties, and this is a great place to start. The number of campus support and peer programs is astounding as well. In your 4, 5, or even 6 years at UBC, you'll have plenty of opportunities for academic enrichment through involvement with research, attending the annual Student Leadership Conference, or even presenting your own Student Directed Seminar. The classes you'll be taking at UBC are challenging but worthwhile, so that doesn't mean everyone can dive into them headfirst and expect to come out on top. It's worthwhile to do some research as to your professors, course content, and anticipate any personal or academic difficulties you might have. If you scan ahead for any potential troubles, and keep the end in mind, then your undergraduate career will be a blast!"", ""Innovative, eye-opening, and self-bettering.

There's also skiing and snowboarding available 40 minutes away, or if you're really serious about winter sports, there's Whistler, the host of the 2010 winter olympics., 73532=It may not be such a challenge to get accepted, however, it's staying in the university that is the challenge. It's a huge campus and lots of walking involved if you live in campus. Don't be deceived by the University advertisements, it rains all the time and the sun only comes out in April., 94176=-The Undie Run is an unusual tradition, but fun! Around March/April students gather together late one night and strip down to their underwear to do a rowdy lap around popular spots on campus. The run usually ends with students jumping in to the outdoor pool and the clothes are donated to a charity or local cause., 133836=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}","02/22/2012 Reviewer is A current student here. 7 out of 7 people found this review useful. 1 of 27 Mona from Canada Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

In general, the campus is far safer than the city. The biggest concern here is petty crime, which makes up about 90% of all crime in Vancouver. Violent crimes are extremely rare. The only time I have ever had a bad experience was when I lived off-campus in east Vancouver (the shady side of town). My suggestion is to be aware of your surroundings and the risks associated with the different parts of town. In general, the campus is quite safe and I occasionally stick my daughter in her stroller and take her for an evening jog. I have never felt unsafe. Clubs and Activities Too",True,0,0,,
