In 2008, our group organized a competition on clinical mass spectrometry based proteomic diagnosis. Eleven international statistical groups participated and constructed a diagnostic classification rule for allocation of future patients on a blinded calibration set. This classification rule was then tested on a blinded validation set. A variety of statistical methods was used to create a classification rule. Mertens and co-workers described a method in which classification error rates were estimated and validated based on a classical Fisher linear discriminant analysis through complete double cross validation [50]. Each sample was assigned to the group for which the probability was highest. Other groups, for example, used the random forest classification method, or a three-step approach with ranking of the mass/charge values using random forests, then grouping into new variables and finding a discriminating rule by penalized logistic regression. For further details and additional statistical methods see http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol7/iss2. This competition showed that a discriminating profile could be created independently of the chosen statistics with consistent results of 80% accuracy [51]., 19908=Int. J. Mol.

The most common system seems to be the suggestion of Harold Jeffreys (1961): These labels can also be a dangerous tool, as they implicitly introduce cutoff values (Ã¢Â€ÂœHey, the BF jumped over the boundary of 3. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s not anecdotal any more, itÃ¢Â€Â™s moderate evidence!Ã¢Â€?). But we do not want another sacred .05 criterion!; see also Andrew GelmanÃ¢Â€Â™s blog post and its critical comments. The strength of the BF is precisely its non-binary nature. Ã‚Â  The bad thing about labels is that an interpretation should always be context dependent (Such as Ã¢Â€Âœ30 min.Ã¢Â€? can be both a long time (train delay) or a short time (concert), as @CaAl said). But once a categorical system has been established, itÃ¢Â€Â™s no longer context dependent. Although the BF is a continuous measure of evidence, humans love verbal labels, categories, and benchmarks. Labels give interpretations of the objective index Ã¢Â€Â“ and that is both the good and the bad about labels. The good thing is that these labels can facilitate communication (but see @richardmorey), and people just crave for verbal interpretations to guide their understanding of those Ã¢Â€ÂœboringÃ¢Â€? raw numbers. A Bayes factor (BF) is a statistical index that quantifies the evidence for a hypothesis, compared to an alternative hypothesis (for introductions to Bayes factors, see here, here or","Ã‚Â  Note: The original label for 3 < BF < 10 was Ã¢Â€Âœsubstantial evidenceÃ¢Â€?. Lee and Wagenmakers (2013) changed it to Ã¢Â€ÂœmoderateÃ¢Â€?, as Ã¢Â€ÂœsubstantialÃ¢Â€? already sounds too decisive. Ã¢Â€ÂœAnecdotalÃ¢Â€? formerly was known as Ã¢Â€ÂœBarely worth mentioningÃ¢Â€?. Kass and Raftery suggested a comparable classification, only that the Ã¢Â€Âœstrong evidenceÃ¢Â€? category for them starts at BF > 20 (see also Wikipedia entry). Getting a feeling for Bayes factors How much is a of 3.7? It indicates that data occured 3.7x more likely under than under , given the priors assumed in the model. Is that a lot of evidence for ? Or not? Following Table 1, it can be labeled Ã¢Â€Âœmoderate evidenceÃ¢Â€? for an effect Ã¢Â€Â“ whatever that means. Some have argued that strong evidence, such as BFs > 10, are quite evident from eyeballing only: Ã¢Â€ÂœIf your result needs a statistician then you should design a better experiment.Ã¢Â€?

Stress fractures are weak spots or small cracks in the bone caused by continuous overuse. Stress fractures often occur in the foot after training for basketball, running, and other sports. There usually is no swelling, but pain and tenderness often increase during movement. Treatment of an overuse injury Specific treatment for an overuse injury will be determined by your child'sÃ‚Â doctor based on: Your child's age, overall health, and medical history Extent of the condition Type of condition Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies Expectations for the course of the condition Your opinion or preference The goal of treatment is to control the pain, promote healing, prevent complications, and restore normal use of the injured area. Initial treatment for overuse injuries includes R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Be sure to consult your child'sÃ‚Â doctor if there is a prolonged, visible deformity of the affected area, or if severe pain prevents use of the arm, leg, wrist, ankle, or knee. Other treatment options may include: Medications Activity restrictions Splint or cast Crutches or wheelchair Physical therapy (to stretch and strengthen the injured muscles, ligaments, and tendons Surgery (especially if the injury is reoccurring, there is persistent pain, or if a muscle, tendon, or ligament is badly torn) Long-term outlook for children with overuse injuries Overuse injuries heal quite quickly in children.

Medidas de los tubos. Para determinar la medida de un tubo no basta con medir el diÃƒÂ¡metro exterior, en una buena parte de ellos la medida nominal se refiere al diÃƒÂ¡metro interior. Un modo para saber el diÃƒÂ¡metro interior nominal de un tubo estÃƒÂ¡ndar de las especificaciones americanas es el siguiente: Mida la longitud de la circunferencia exterior del tubo, por ejemplo, enrollando una cinta alrededor de ÃƒÂ©l y use la tabla 1 para determinar el diÃƒÂ¡metro interior. Los tubos Los tubos utilizados en el hogar pueden ser de diferentes materiales, diÃƒÂ¡metro y espesor de las paredes de acuerdo al uso a que se destinen. Otro tipo de vÃƒÂ¡lvula de paso que debe tenerse en la casa son las que estÃƒÂ¡n debajo de los accesorios como fregaderos, lavamanos y taza sanitaria, justo donde el tubo sale de la pared o del piso. Usualmente estÃƒÂ¡n en pares, una para el agua caliente y otra para el agua frÃƒÂ­a. A estas vÃƒÂ¡lvulas se conectan directamente cada una de las llaves de salida del accesorio a travÃƒÂ©s de una manguera flexible o un tubo. TambiÃƒÂ©n pueden (y deben) haber otras vÃƒÂ¡lvulas intermedias en determinadas ÃƒÂ¡reas, por ejemplo, a la entrada del calentador de agua, en la pared exterior de la casa en el tubo principal de suministro, o en sÃƒÂ³tanos o cuartos con varias","Tubos de suministro Tubos de cobre Los tubos de cobre (figura 3) son extremadamente duraderos y seguros, pero son relativamente caros y usualmente se usan en el hogar para las lineas de suministro con diÃƒÂ¡metros entre 12 mm (Ã‚Â½"") y 25 mm (1""). Pueden ser rÃƒÂ­gidos o flexibles y con las paredes mas o menos gruesas. En el sistema norteamericano, el espesor de las paredes se indica con las letras, M, L y K en forma creciente. Los de grado M son los de paredes mas finas y son adecuados para la mayorÃƒÂ­a de las aplicaciones domÃƒÂ©sticas. Los de grado L se requieren por algunos cÃƒÂ³digos locales para uso en locales comerciales y en ciertas aplicaciones domÃƒÂ©sticas y los K (los mas gruesos) se usan para las entradas principales de suministro soterradas. TambiÃƒÂ©n se han usado tubos de cobre de diÃƒÂ¡metros mayores para desagÃƒÂ¼e, pero cada vez se usan menos y van siendo sustituÃƒÂ­dos por los tubos mas baratos de PVC en esta aplicaciÃƒÂ³n. Para ciertas situaciones donde los tubos de desagÃƒÂ¼e estÃƒÂ¡n a la vista (por ejemplo, fregaderos o lavamanos) es frecuente que se usen tubos de cobre o latÃƒÂ³n, cromados brillantes, para las partes visibles por razones de estÃƒÂ©tica y limpieza. Los tubos de cobre rÃƒÂ­gidos de grado M estÃƒÂ¡n estandarizados por su diÃƒÂ¡metro interior, los de grado L y K se clasifican por su diÃƒÂ¡metro exterior.",True,0,0,,

The ""related content"" class, when specified, can be used for non-photo items such as links. One use could be adding a link to a related web site, the thumbnail being a screenshot of some of the site's content instead of a photo. A few alternate thumbnail types can be used, including ""video"" and ""related content"". The video type doesn't use the standard thumbnail JPEG, but instead looks for a GIF image based on the name of the photo being loaded. The GIF format of course allows for an animation to be used (ie., showing a few frames of the video) if desired. Thumbnails are displayed on hover of a photo item, giving a preview of the image in question. To reduce (in theory, at least,) page load time, one ""strip"" image includes thumbnails of all photos - reducing the number of browser requests that would be otherwise made for individual thumbnails. Image thumbnails are arranged vertically, and are put in a file named thumbnails.jpg within each image collection directory.

En el artÃƒÂ­culo, los autores se esmeran por negar la posibilidad de una continuidad cultural entre el mundo antiguo, tanto griego como romano, y el bizantino. El anÃƒÂ¡lisis se apoya fundamentalmente en la comparaciÃƒÂ³n de elementos polÃƒÂ­ticos, sociales, artÃƒÂ­sticos, religiosos y ÃƒÂ©ticos y en menor grado literarios, para concluir finalmente que, aunque en Bizancio es posible admitir para ciertos periodos de su historia una cierta intenciÃƒÂ³n de imitar a los antiguos (uÃƒÂ­ur|or|), no es posible plantear que exista una continuidad cultural sino mÃƒÂ¡s bien una discontinuidad.

When the element count on the first line of the file specifies it contains more than 1,073,741,824 (2 to the power of 30) elements, a potentially exploitable heap overflow condition occurs. Analysis: Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. As the X11 server requires direct access to video hardware, it runs with elevated privileges. A user compromising an X server would gain those permissions. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be able to cause the X server to use a maliciously constructed font. The X11 server contains multiple methods for a user to define additional paths to look for fonts. An exploit has been developed using the ""-fp"" command line option to the X11 server to pass the location of the attack to the server.

If you plan on road racing, autocrossing, or carving up the nearest mountain road, then find out what others are running in the real world. Lastly, there are asymmetric and directional patterned tires that combine the previous two designs. They're treated as directional in terms of rotation, and if you run different sized tires front and rear then each tire becomes location-specific and negates the possibility of rotating your tires. Directional pattern tires (also referred to as unidirectional) incorporate lateral grooves on both sides of the tireÃ¢Â€Â™s centerline that run in the same direction and create V- or wedge-shaped tread blocks. This really helps in the rain as the pattern Ã¢Â€ÂœpumpsÃ¢Â€? water more efficiently out from under the tire.

I felt great, had energy, lost weight, wasn't hungry all the time, and cut down on my insulin needs. I started reading, watching documentaries, and learning. I started incorporating juice into my high protein, low carb diet. I did a few more juice fasts, cut down on animal products, and started eating more whole grains. Then I read ""The China Study"" a few months ago. I started transitioning to a plant based, whole grain diet, and then started learning more about raw. The last week in December, I went vegetarian and started uncooking more raw foods. I have more energy, many of my medical problems have either lessened or gone away completely, and I'm going full steam ahead with a plant based, partly raw diet. The most amazing thing, that made me a total believer, is I stopped taking insulin for 5 days. 5 days without insulin is unheard of for a type one diabetic, and none of my western doctors understand it. My acupuncturist and chiropractor are all about it though. I'm having a hard time getting rid of butter and Parmesan cheese, but besides that I don't really eat any animal foods., 154940=Sep 29, 2014, 161495=May 11, 2013, 191658=Apr 11, 2013, 121047=Jan 29, 2015, 123835=Oct 13, 2014, 135830=Jul 08, 2014, 149211=May 16, 2013, 113238=Apr 01, 2013, 128432=Oct 18, 2014}","{1=Ã‚Â© 2009-2015 The Rawtarian.

Format The more formats MP4 player supports, the more convenience users enjoy in use. There is no need to transform the video format, just play it directly. The most common formats: RM, RMVB, MPEG, AVI, etc. 2. Screen You should consider the screen size of MP4 player first and then the resolution. The ideal screen size is between 2.8"" and 4.3"". It is hard to see details as MP4 comes with too small screen while it is hard to carry as MP4 comes with too large screen. The higher resolution MP4 delivers the clearer pictures it shows. 3. Memory Generally speaking, it is much better to choose MP4 with memory above 4GB. Or MP4 with small capacity can support TF or SD card at least. Nowadays, movies become much clearer with increasing capacity. Memory of a standard high definition movie is more than 1G. Thus, MP4 with enough capacity can hold lots of your favorite movies. 4. Battery You'd better choose MP4 with rechargeable and high performance lithium ion battery. Not only can you enjoy long battery life but also you can recharge the battery when it runs out, both cost-effective and environmental friendly. 5. Function Apart from the video play, MP4 also functions as MP3, broadcast, e-book, dictionary and more. Some MP4 allows downloading certain software to apply.

Good luck this season! NFL Football is here. With all of the work already done on our end, we figured we would share our comprehensive, week-by-week fantasy football projections with our users, as the focus of our weekly BtB feature. This thorough analysis and statistical evaluation of every player and team in the NFL is part of a broader endeavor with FOXSports.com's Fantasy Football. Each regular season game is simulated 61 times, with the averages of those games being our final predicted outcome. This allows us to account for ever player and stat. As Rosters and depth charts are up-to-date and as accurate as possible as of the Monday before each week's games. We will update these projections each week on Tuesday morning. The same is true for the widget that appears on this page and includes game scores. Week December 4th, 2007 By Paul Bessire, WhatIfSports.com BtB Previews Week 14 in Fantasy Football","* The individual players and defensive teams are ranked based entirely on projected weekly fantasy points using the FOX Fantasy Football Default Scoring where for QBs, RBs, WRs and TE, all TDs are 6 points, each 25 yards passing are 1 point, interceptions are -2 points, fumbles lost are -2 points, each ten yards receiving or rushing are 1 point and two-point conversions are 2 points. For kickers, all extra points are 1 point and all field goals are at least 3 points with an extra bonus point for field goals made over 40 yards and another bonus point for field goals made over 50 yards. Individual defensive players (linked to below, but not inlcuded in overall rankings) earn 1 point for each solo tackle, 1 point for each sack, 2 points for each interception and six points for each touchdown. Team defenses include special teams and are treated similarly for sacks, interceptions and touchdown returns, while a more complex system, based on the outcome of each individual game, is utilized for points allowed per game.

There is a worldwide increase in disease prevalence due to the increasing age of human populations. The disease is characterized by tremor, stiffness of the limbs and trunk, impaired balance and coordination, and slowing of movements, leading to immobility and frequent falls. Patients also sometimes develop other symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, disturbed sleep, and emotional problems. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. The cause and mechanism of continued neuron cell death in the substantia nigra is currently unknown. Epidemiological studies suggest an association between Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis, vitamin D inadequacy and altered bone and mineral metabolism. Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with Parkinson's disease are at a higher risk for fractures compared to healthy subjects. This could be attributed to several contributing factors including increased rate of falls, vitamin D deficiency, reduced body mass index and reduced bone mineral density.

Yet even HAART-treated HIV infection is characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and immune activation. This systemic inflammatory response is composed of multiple components, and can be quantified by measuring markers of immune activation, inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants, endothelial activation markers, and markers of microbial translocation. This inflammation is clinically relevant, as it may contribute directly to HIV disease progression and non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Because this inflammation persists even in the context of suppressive HAART, albeit at modestly decreased levels, adjunctive therapeutic strategies to attenuate this persistent inflammatory response are therefore needed. Herpes simplex virus type 2 is a common, clinically important co-infection seen in individuals living with HIV infection, and may contribute to this ongoing inflammation. This pilot trial will investigate whether short-term valacyclovir for HSV-2 suppression can decrease systemic inflammation in HAART-treated, HIV-1, HSV-2 co-infected individuals.

In Sweden alone approximately 1.8 million persons, 25% of the adult population, have hypertension. Hypertension is a common diagnosis in primary health care and the costs of investigating and treating hypertension and its consequences are considerable. We know that stress can affect blood pressure, but it is hard to measure and control. Previous studies have separately shown that yoga can reduce levels of cortisol in saliva and lower blood pressure. However, few studies have investigated the effects of yoga on hypertension and we lack information about the possibility of using yoga in primary health care to reduce hypertension. If yoga can be used to complement antihypertensive medicines, it could reduce medicine intake and thereby possibly reduce side effects and lower medicine costs. It is to be hoped that patients will also experience a higher quality of life if they perform yoga on a regular basis.

Irradiation both in vivo and in vitro was used as a molecular probe of the constraints on DNA~packaging in the bacterial chromosome. The extremely gentle lysis and unfolding procedures which were developed yielded undamaged, replicating genomes, thus permitting direct measurement of the formation and repair of DNA double-strand breaks at biologically-significant doses of ionizing radiation. In vitro UV-irradiation of nucleoids resulted in an increase in the observed rate of sedimentation due to the formation of an unknown photo-product. In contrast, UV-irradiation of wild-type cells in vivo showed evidence of the formation of incision breaks which resulted in the relaxation of supercoiling in the nucleoid. Strand breakage was also observed following in vivo UV-irradiation of a uvrB-5 strain, but at a lower rate and also accompanied by considerable unfolding of the chromosome. Such lesions may have been the result of direct photochemical reactions in the nucleoid, or enzyme activity associated with a uvr-independent mode of repair. The number of domains of supercoiling was estimated at 170 per genome equivalent of DNA based on measurements of relaxation caused by single-strand break formation in in vivo- and in vitro-gamma-irradiated folded chromosomes. Similar estimates based on the target size of RNA molecules responsible for maintaining the compact packaging of the nucleoid predicted negligible unfolding due to the formation of RNA single-strand breaks at doses up-to 10 Krad, and were born out by experimental measurements. Unfolding of the nucleoid in vitro by limit-digestion with RNase or by heating at 70Ã‚Â° resulted in DNA complexes with sedimentation coefficients of 1030Ã‚Â±59S and 625Ã‚Â±15S respectively. The difference in these rates was apparently due to more complete deproteinization and thus less mass in the heated material. These structures are believed to represent intact, replicating genomes in the form of complex-theta structures containing 2-3 genome equivalents of DNA. The rate of formation of double-strand breaks was determined from molecular weight measurements of thermally unfolded chromosomal DNA gamma-irradiated in vitro. Break formation was linear with dose up to 10 Krad, resulting in 0.27 double-strand breaks per kilorad per genome equivalent of DNA and requiring 1080 eV/double-strand break. The influence of possible non-linear DNA conformations of these calculations is discussed. Repair of ionizing radiation damage to folded chromosomes was observed within 2-3 hours of post-irradiation incubation in growth medium. A model based on recombinational repair is proposed to explain the formation of 2200-2300S material during early stages of incubation and subsequent changes in the gradient profiles. Such behavior is not observed for post-irradiation incubation of wild-type cells in buffer or for a recA-13 strain incubated in growth medium. Association of unrepaired DNA with plasma membrane is proposed to explain the formation of a peak of rapidly sedimenting material (>>3100S) during the later stages of repair. Direct evidence of repair of double-strand breaks during post-irradiation incubation in growth medium was obtained from gradient profiles of DNA from RNAse-digested chromosomes. The sedimentation coefficient of broken molecules was restored to the value of unirradiated DNA after 2-3 hours of incubation, and the fraction of the DNA repaired in this fashion was equal to the fraction of cells which survived at the same dose. An average of 2.7 double-strand breaks per genome per lethal event was observed, suggesting that 1-2 double-strand breaks per genome are repairable in this strain of E. coli.', 'application/pdf', 'en_US', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution', 'WHOI Theses', 'Escherichia coli', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial genetics', 'DNA repair', 'Chromosomes', 'Centrifugation', 'Rate zonal density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of repair of radiation damage to the folded chromosome of Escherichia coli', 'Thesis', '10.1575/1912/1833'], ['', '', '', '', '', 'en', 'en', '', 'en', 'en', 'en', 'en_US', 'en_US', 'en_US', 'en_US', 'en_US', 'en_US', 'en', 'en', '']]",Rate zonal density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of repair of radiation damage to the folded chromosome of Escherichia coli,,https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/1833?show=full,False,NONE,RELATION,0,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00206-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,853230131,853214121,VERTICAL,,Show simple item record View Usage Statistics Statistics Register Login My Account Keywords Titles Authors By Issue Date This Collection Keywords Titles Authors By Issue Date Communities & Collections All of WHOAS Browse This Collection Search WHOAS JavaScript is disabled for your browser.

Planning to upgrade the navy's amphibious fleet began in 2000, based on Australian experiences leading the International Force for East Timor peacekeeping operation. In 2004, French company Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) and Spanish company Navantia were invited to tender proposals, with DCN offering the Mistral-class amphibious assault ship and Navantia proposing the ""Buque de ProyecciÃƒÂ³n EstratÃƒÂ©gica"" design (later commissioned as Juan Carlos I). The Spanish design was selected in 2007, with Navantia responsible for construction of the ships from the keel to the flight deck, and BAE Systems Australia handling the fabrication of the superstructure and fitting out., 42790=Construction of Canberra began in September 2008, when the first steel was cut.[13] The first three blocks were laid down on 23 September 2010.[13] She was launched on 17 February 2011.[34][35] The hull was loaded onto the heavy lift ship MVÃ‚Â Blue Marlin on 4 August 2012, with Blue Marlin departing Ferrol for Williamstown on 17 August, and arriving in Port Phillip on 17 October.[36][37][38] Canberra commenced sea trials on 3 March 2014.[39] Contractor-run sea trials concluded in early September, and Canberra was commissioned into the RAN on 28 November 2014.[40][41], 14370=In January 2006, the Australian government announced the names for the planned ships: Canberra and Adelaide.[5] After the announcement, suggestions for alternate names were expressed in several venues.

the first reflecting the landings at Gallipoli, one of the first amphibious operations of the modern era, the second recognising the amphibious campaign to recapture Guadalcanal and the efforts of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps in aiding Australia during World War II.[7], 18529=A Request For Information and invitation for tenders was sent to two European shipbuilders in February 2004; French company Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) and Spanish company Navantia.[9] Shipbuilders from the United States were not included, as American amphibious warfare ships were too large for Australian requirements, and were either too personnel-intensive or could not operate the number of helicopters required.[10] DCN responded with an enlarged version of the Mistral-class amphibious assault ship; 2,000 tonnes (2,000 long tons; 2,200 short tons) greater displacement than the 22,000-tonne (22,000-long-ton; 24,000-short-ton) vessels active with the French Navy.[11] A design being built by Navantia for the Spanish Navy, the ""Buque de ProyecciÃƒÂ³n EstratÃƒÂ©gica"" (Strategic Projection Ship, later commissioned as Juan Carlos I) was offered by the Spanish, partnering with Australian company Tenix Defence.[11] Although 4,000 tonnes (3,900 long tons; 4,400 short tons) larger and with an increased troop, vehicle, and helicopter carrying capability compared to the Mistrals, the Spanish ship was still under construction at the time of the offer, and was not due to enter service until late 2008.[11] On 20 June 2007, Minister for Defence Brendan Nelson announced that the A$3 billion contract to build the Canberra class had been awarded to Navantia and Tenix.[12][13] Although an unproven design, the Spanish offer was closer to the RAN's requested requirements, and there were benefits from ordering the Canberras and the new Hobart-class air warfare destroyers from the same company.[11], 24023=Propulsion is provided by two Siemens 11-megawatt (15,000Ã‚Â hp) azimuth thrusters, each with an onboard electric motor, driving two 4.5-metre (15Ã‚Â ft) diameter propellers.[14][15] The electricity is provided by a Combined diesel and gas system, with a single General Electric LM2500 turbine producing 19,160 kilowatts (25,690Ã‚Â hp), supported by two MAN 16V32/40 diesel generators providing 7,448 kilowatts (9,988Ã‚Â hp).[14] The main thrusters are supplemented by two 1,500 kilowatts (2,000Ã‚Â hp) bow thrusters, and a 1,350-kilowatt (1,810Ã‚Â hp) Progener-Mitsubishi S16MPTA diesel generator is fitted as an emergency backup.[14] The vessels have a maximum speed of over 20 knots (37Ã‚Â km/h; 23Ã‚Â mph), a maximum sustainable full-load speed of 19 knots (35Ã‚Â km/h; 22Ã‚Â mph), and an economical cruising speed of 15 knots (28Ã‚Â km/h; 17Ã‚Â mph), with a corresponding range of 9,000 nautical miles (17,000Ã‚Â km; 10,000Ã‚Â mi).[14] The LHDs can maintain full directional control while reversing at up to 8 knots (15Ã‚Â km/h; 9.2Ã‚Â mph).[14], 11027=Planning to replace the Kanimbla-class landing platform amphibious ships Kanimbla and Manoora, and the heavy landing ship Tobruk began as early as 2000, with the intention announced in the Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force white paper.[1] The importance of amphibious warfare had been demonstrated during Australia's leadership of the International Force for East Timor peacekeeping operation: the difficulty in supporting an expeditionary force to one of Australia's nearest neighbours demonstrated the need for an improved amphibious sealift capability.[2][3] In November 2003, the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill, released a Defence Capability Review, which stated that two ships of at least 20,000 tonnes (20,000 long tons; 22,000 short tons) displacement and capable of launching five to six helicopters simultaneously were being sought.[1] The acquisition was included under the procurement designation Project JP2048: although Phase 1 of JP2048 looked at a new type of landing craft for the Kanimbla class (the LCM2000), Phases 2 and 4 were to identify, then acquire the new amphibious warfare ships, and Phase 3 covered the design and construction of compatible landing craft (12 LCM-1E, ordered on 27 September 2011).[2][4] The ships were originally to replace one of the Kanimbla-class ships and Tobruk, with the other Kanimbla-class ship later replaced by a strategic sealift ship.[2], 48743=The early decommissioning of the two Kanimbla-class vessels in 2011, several years before Canberra-class ships would enter service, led to the acquisition of the landing ship dock HMASÃ‚Â Choules and the support vessel ADVÃ‚Â Ocean Shield.[47][48] Once the two LHDs enter full operational service, Ocean Shield will be transferred to the Customs Marine Unit of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.[48][49], 46140=Work on Adelaide began during February 2010, when the first steel was cut.[3] The first hull blocks were laid down on 18 February 2011, and Adelaide was launched on 4 July 2012.[33][42] Initially, the ship was due to reach Australia in early 2013 to begin final fitout,[17][33] but this did not occur.[clarification needed] The hull was loaded onto Blue Marlin on 10 December 2013 in Vigo Bay.[43] Blue Marlin and Adelaide arrived at Williamstown on 7 February 2014.[44] Entry into RAN service was originally planned for mid-2015, but as of July 2011, this had been pushed back to sometime in 2016.[3][33], 77868=Kerr, Julian (26 May 2014). ""Australia could buy F-35B"". IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. Retrieved 8 June 2014.Ã‚Â , 8570=Construction of the first ship, HMASÃ‚Â Canberra, commenced in late 2008, with the hull launched in early 2011, and sea trials in early 2014. Canberra was commissioned in November 2014. Work on the second vessel, HMASÃ‚Â Adelaide, started in early 2010. Adelaide is predicted to enter service in 2016. They are the largest vessels ever operated by the RAN, with a displacement of 27,500 tonnes (27,100 long tons; 30,300 short tons)., 28834=The LHDs will be able to transport 1,046 soldiers and their equipment, and can carry 1,600 in overload conditions.[17][18] They are to be capable deploying a reinforced company of up to 220 soldiers at a time by airlift.[3] In mid-2010, the intention was to retrain 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment for the commando and amphibious warfare roles, but under Plan Bersheeba, released in December 2012, 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment was the unit marked to become the core of the Australian marine force.[3][19] Two vehicle decks (one for light vehicles, the other for heavy vehicles and tanks) have areas of 1,880 square metres (20,200Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â ft) and 1,410 square metres (15,200Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â ft) respectively, and between them can accommodate up to 110 vehicles.[14] The heavy vehicle deck may alternately be used for cargo, with a capacity of 196 shipping containers.[18] Each ship has a 69.3-by-16.8-metre (227 by 55Ã‚Â ft) well deck, that houses up to four LHD Landing Craft (LLC, the RAN designation for the LCM-1E), which can be launched and recovered in conditions up to Sea State 4.[14][15][20] Twelve were ordered from Navantia, which delivered them in batches of four during 2014 and 2015.[21] Six LLC are be assigned to each LHD, with the additional craft used for training and trials at shore bases, and rotated to their parent ship when embarked craft require maintenance.[20][21] The well deck also has room for four Rigid-hulled inflatable boats (although these will not be carried as standard), and can be used by other nations' landing craft and amphibious vehicles.[14], 36125=The ski-jump ramp of Juan Carlos I has been retained for the RAN ships, although is not intended for use.[17] The Spanish use the ramp to launch Harrier jet aircraft, and although operating STOVL aircraft was decided against early in the Australian procurement process due to cost and detraction from the ship's main role, redesigning the ship to remove the ramp would have added unnecessary cost to the project.[23] The retention of the ski-jump has prompted multiple recommendations that fixed-wing aircraft be operated from the ships (primarily envisaged as a flight group of F-35B Lightning II STOVL aircraft).[17][24][25][26] The RAN has maintained that embarking Australian-operated, fixed-wing aircraft was not under consideration, although has conceded that cross-decking with other nations' aircraft could possibly occur.[17][24][26] In May 2014, Minister for Defence David Johnston stated in media interviews that the government was considering acquiring F-35B fighters for the CanberraÃ¢Â€?Ã¢Â€ÂŠ'Ã¢Â€Â‹s, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott instructed 2015 Defence White Paper planners to consider the option of embarking F-35B squadrons aboard the two ships.[27][28] This assessment found that the cost of modifying the ships to operate F-35Bs would be very high, and the idea was rejected before the completion of the White Paper.[29]}",

In the 1840s, California pioneers looking for outstanding vineyard sites began planting grapes in the region. Robert Livermore planted the first commercial vines in the 1840s. After California joined the union as the 32nd state in 1850, pioneer winemakers C. H. Wente, a first-generation immigrant from Germany,[77] (founder of Wente Vineyards), James Concannon, a first generation Irishman,[78] (founder of Concannon Vineyard), and Charles Wetmore, a Portland Maine born American and pioneer of California,[79] (founder of Cresta Blanca Winery) recognized the areaÃ¢Â€Â™s winegrowing potential and bought land, planted grapes and founded their wineries in the 1880s.[80] Charles Wetmore went to France in 1878 when he was appointed a delegate for the California Viticultural Association to the Paris Exposition. Charles was able in 1882 to obtain Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscat de Bordelais cuttings from one of the most prestigious vineyards in France, Chateau Yquem. These superior clones helped revitalize the California wine industry. In 1889 Charles won the grand prize for his first pressing (1884) in the 1889 Paris Exposition. Charles shared these cuttings with other growers including C. H.

A 110+ year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, housed in the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department main station, is still burning. It glows dimly, but still functions as a light bulb.[73] The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and General Electric have concluded that the bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the exception of power failures and three times it was disconnected for moves to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company and was hand blown with a carbon filament., 108856=The largest employer in Livermore is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a federally funded research and development center funded by the Department of Energy which is operated by a limited liability consortium named Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), a joint venture company of Bechtel National, the University of California, BWX Technologies, URS, and Battelle. The lab is the location of the IBM Sequoia supercomputer. The lab was the co-discoverers of new superheavy elements 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, and 118. The chemical element with atomic number 116, previously known as ununhexium, was given the name livermorium, after the laboratory, in 2012., 55124=Robert Livermore died in 1858 and was buried at Mission San Jose before the establishment of the town that bears his name. His ranch included much of the present-day city. The city of Livermore, named in honor of Robert Livermore, was established in 1869 by William Mendenhall,[20] who had first met Robert Livermore while marching through the valley with John C. Fremont's California Battalion in 1846 as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering Californio towns captured by the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron., 99580=The 2010 United States Census[69] reported that Livermore had a population of 80,968. The population density was 3,216.1 people per square mile (1,241.8/kmÃ‚Â²). The census reported that (99.4% of the population) lived in households, 389 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 121 (0.1%) were institutionalized., 123422=Livermore Municipal Airport (LVK)[84] is located three miles northwest of Livermore and is a Division of the Public Works Department and is owned and operated by the City of Livermore. They are the main airport in the Livermore tri-valley area. Approximately 600 aircraft are based on Livermore Airport, which has over 150,000 annual aircraft landings and take-offs each year. The Airport serves private, business, and corporate tenants and customers. The airport covers about 650-acres. The main lighted runway is 5,250Ã‚Â ft long.[85] The main terminal building covers 2,400 sq ft. The airfield is accessible 24 hours a day and is attended by city employees during the hours listed under Ã¢Â€ÂœAirport Services"". The manned Air Traffic Control Tower is operated by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees daily from 7:00 A.M. until 9:00 P.M. There is an open airshow which is held annually on the first Saturday of October from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM showing vintage World War-II aircraft and other displays., 56744=The Livermore Ranch post office, in Robert Livermore's home, operated from 1851 to 1853.[9] The first significant settlement of Livermore was Laddsville, on what's now Junction Avenue, which grew up around the hotel established by Alphonso Ladd in 1864. The official U.S. post office in Livermore opened in 1869.[9] The original Western Pacific Railroad Company in 1869 built its railroad connection from Oakland, California, to Sacramento, California, over the nearby Altamont Pass in the east and Niles Canyon on the west with a stop in Livermore on land donated by William M. Mendenhall. This made Livermore a ""railroad""[22] town and greatly accelerated town growth. The population of Livermore in 1869, before the railroad arrived, is thought to have been about 75[23] By 1870 the Western Pacific had been absorbed by the Central Pacific Railroad as part of the first transcontinental railroad. Central Pacific was later acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad and then the Union Pacific Railroad which owns the tracks through town today, although these are primarily the tracks of the ""second"" Western Pacific Railroad that was founded in 1903 and absorbed into the UP in 1983.[citation needed], 28220=Livermore has a Mediterranean climate,[11] although it is close to a semi-arid climate because of its relatively low annual precipitation. It features with warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters (KÃƒÂ¶ppen climate classification Csa). Summer (JuneÃ¢Â€Â“October) daytime temperatures average in the 75Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (24Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) to 85Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (29Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) range, but sometimes reach 100Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (38Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) and can occasionally approach 110Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (43Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C). Summer nights, however, are normally much cooler, with lows in the 50Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (10Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) to 60Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (16Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) range. The valley's passes direct the normal west to east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter Central Valley. This wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about 9 miles per hour (14Ã‚Â km/h) and predictable enough to make the Livermore hills covered with wind turbines mounted in Altamont pass. The period from June to September is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies, but in late summer, subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley, bringing high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms., 62389=In 1942, the U. S. government bought 692 acres (280Ã‚Â ha) of ranch land, bounded by Vasco and Greenville roads and East Avenue, and built the Livermore Naval Air Station. The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of World War II. On 5 January 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy, formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), named after famous physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, as the site of a second laboratory for the study of nuclear energy like the research being done at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The laboratory was run by the University of California. Edward Teller was a co-founder of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and was both its director and associate director for many years.[27] In 1956, the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories opened up across East Avenue from LLNL. Both LLNL and Sandia are technically on U.S. government property just outside the city's jurisdiction limits but with employment at LLNL at about 6,800 and Sandia/California at about 1,150 they are Livermore's largest employers., 47070=Before its incorporation in 1796 under the Franciscan Mission San Jose, located in what is now the southern part of Fremont, California, the Livermore area was home to some of the Ohlone (or Costanoan) native people. Each mission had two to three friars and a contingent of up to five soldiers to help keep order in the Mission and to help control the Indians. Like most Indians in California, the Indians in the vicinity of Mission San Jose were mostly coerced into joining the Mission San JosÃƒÂ© (California) where they were taught Spanish, the Catholic religion, singing, construction, agricultural trades and herdingÃ¢Â€Â”the Native Californian Indians originally had no agriculture and no domestic animals except dogs. Other Indian tribes were coerced into other adjacent Missions. The Mission Indians were restricted to the Mission grounds where they lived in sexually segregated ""barracks"" that they built themselves with Padre instruction. The population of all California Missions plunged steeply as new diseases ravaged the Mission Indian populationsÃ¢Â€Â”they had almost no immunities to these ""new to them"" diseases and death rates over 50% were not uncommon.[16] The Livermore-Amador Valley after 1800 to about 1837 was primarily used as grazing land for some of the Mission San Jose's growing herds of mission cattle, sheep and horses. The herds grew wild with no fences and were culled about once a year for cow hides and tallowÃ¢Â€Â”essentially the only money making products produced in California then. The dead animals were left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears which then roamed California. The secularization and closure of the California missions, as demanded by the government of Mexico, from 1834 to 1837 transferred the land and property the Missions claimed on the California coast (about 1,000,000 acres (400,000Ã‚Â ha) per mission) to about 600 extensive Ranchos of California. After the Missions were dissolved, most of the surviving Indians went to work on the new ranchos raising crops and herding animals where they were given room and board, a few clothes and usually no pay for the work they didÃ¢Â€Â”the same as they had had while working in the Missions. Some Indians joined or re-joined some of the few surviving tribes.[citation needed], 100171=According to the latest census information, Livermore is the third wealthiest midsize (between 65,000 and 249,999 people) city in the nation. In 2005, the median household income in Livermore was $96,632, which ranked it the third highest-income midsize city, behind only the California cities of Newport Beach ($97,428) and Livermore's western neighbor, Pleasanton ($101,022).[70], 87468=The Livermore Area Recreation and Park District (LARPD) is a special independent, (non-profit 501(c) organization), park district that was created by the vote of the public in 1947 and runs the parks and other facilities in the city of Livermore and most of the unincorporated areas of eastern Alameda county. LARPD operates 42 facilities,[54] including neighborhood, special use, community and regional parks and sport fields, a family campground at South Lake Tahoe, the Ravenswood Historic Site, The Barn, the Veterans Building, the Carnegie Building, the Bothwell Recreation Center and the new Robert Livermore Community Center. LARPD runs the May Nissen Community Park and Swim Center[55] at 685 Rincon Ave and is open to swimmers with a $0.25 admission price from mid-June through end of AugustÃ¢Â€Â”closed Sundays. May Nissan Park includes a tot lot, group picnic area, barbecue pits, picnic tables, preschool, basketball court, restrooms, horseshoe pits, softball areas, tennis courts, 2 swimming pools, and a dog park., 50608=The about 48,000 acres (19,000Ã‚Â ha) Rancho Las Positas grant, which includes most of Livermore, was made to rancher Robert Livermore and Jose Noriega in 1839.[17][18] Most land grants were given with little or no cost to the recipients. Robert Livermore (1799-1858)[19] was a British citizen who had jumped from a British merchant sailing ship stopping in Monterey, California, in 1822. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen who had converted to Catholicism in 1823 as was required for citizenship and legal residence. After working for a number of years as a majordomo (ranch foreman), Robert Livermore married on 5 May 1838 the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera (1815Ã¢Â€Â“1879), daughter of Jose Loreto Higuera grantee of Rancho Los Tularcitos, at the Mission San JosÃƒÂ©. Robert Livermore. after he got his rancho in 1839, was as interested in viticulture and horticulture as he was in cattle and horses despite the fact that about the only source of income was the sale of cow hides and tallow. In the early 1840s he moved his family to the Livermore valley to his new rancho as the second non-Indian family to settle in the Livermore valley area and after building a home he was the first in the area in 1846 to direct the planting of vineyards and orchards of pears and olives. Typical of most early rancho dwellings the first building on his ranch was an adobe on Las Positas Creek near the western end of today's Las Positas Road. After the Americans took control of California in 1847 and gold was discovered in 1848 he started making money by selling California longhorn cattle to the thousands of hungry California gold rush miners who soon arrived. The non-Indian population exploded and cattle were suddenly worth much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. With his new wealth and with goods flooding into newly rich California, in 1849 Livermore bought a two-story ""Around the Horn"" disassembled house that had been shipped about 18,000 miles (29,000Ã‚Â km) on a sailing ship around Cape Horn from the east coast. It is believed to be the first wooden building in the Livermore tri-valley.[citation needed], 61851=In 1909 the Livermore Carnegie Library and Park opened after taking advantage of a Carnegie Library grant donated by Andrew Carnegie. As the city grew and larger libraries were needed other libraries were built and the original site was converted into a historic center[26] and park., 90653=LARPD operates parks and facilities of 1,842 acres (745Ã‚Â ha), with 1,432 acres (580Ã‚Â ha) open space. It runs an extensive selection of classes on a wide variety of subjects. LARPD has its own, five-person Board of Directors[59] that is elected by the citizens to staggered four year terms and meets at 7 p.m. on the second and last Wednesday of each month inside the Cresta Blanca Ballroom at the Robert Livermore Community Center, 4444 East Ave. They are paid $100/meeting with a maximum of $500/month. The General Manager of LARPD is Timothy BarryÃ¢Â€Â”selected by the board and paid $137,160/yr plus unspecified benefits including Alameda County retirement plan (ACERA) with 29.13% of LARPD salary contribution rate to a well paid retirement plan.[60] In addition, there are 13 paid holidays, vacation, sick leave, medical, dental, life insurance, etc. adding about $55,000/yr in benefits to the General Manager's salary.[61][62] The organization and facilities are extensive[63] and LARPD hires many part-time workers (up to about 430 at peak times) from Park Rangers to referees in its extensive programs and classes with a permanent staff of about 63.[64][65] The 2012-2013 operating budget of LARPD is $16,393,564 plus a capital budget of $3,870,971. Their source of operating income is property taxes, user fees, charges and grants. Unfortunately, the state has cut down on their share of property taxes as the state re-allocate more to itself and their never ending fiscal crisis's. LARPD serves an area that encompasses about 115,000 people., 69094=Livermore has a strong blue-collar element, as well as many professionals who work at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other work sites in the high tech industries within the Bay Area. Recent housing development has included the addition of hundreds of million dollar homes set among the southside's vineyards, as well as a multi-million dollar renovation of the downtown area. Renovations included office buildings, the Livermore Cinemas, the Bankhead Theatre,[32] and a multistory parking structure. The Livermore Civic Center includes a state-of-the-art library that opened in 2004, with a front mosaic by Maria Alquilar., 81198=The District has 11 elementary (K-5 and K-8) schools, 3 middle (6-8) schools, 2 comprehensive high schools and 3 alternative high schools. As of the 2012-2013 school year, the public school superintendent is Kelly Bowers who was hired by the elected school board in 2010., 77730=The Livermore Police Department, or the LPD,[40] was established in 1876, at that time the only law enforcement agency in the San Francisco Bay Area besides the San Francisco Police Department. The Livermore Police Department has 135 members including 83 sworn officers and 45 nonsworn full-time personnel who operate on a $25 million budget each year. The police department has two divisions: operations and support. The current chief of police is Michael Harris. In July 2008, the LPD opened its first substation in New Downtown Livermore, known as the Central Station or Downtown Office. The main police station is located in the City Hall center at 1052 S. Livermore Ave. The Livermore Police Department Dispatch Center employs 18 public safety dispatchers with one supervising public safety dispatcher that are on duty 24/7 to handle 911 emergency calls., 31026=The record high temperature is 115Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (46Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C), recorded on September 3, 1950, and the record low temperature is 18Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C), recorded on January 5, 1961 and December 9, 1972.[13], 114195=One of CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s oldest wine regions, the Livermore Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) played a pivotal role in shaping CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s wine industry. In the 1840s, California pioneers looking for outstanding vineyard sites began planting grapes in the region. Robert Livermore planted the first commercial vines in the 1840s. After California joined the union as the 32nd state in 1850, pioneer winemakers C. H. Wente, a first-generation immigrant from Germany,[77] (founder of Wente Vineyards), James Concannon, a first generation Irishman,[78] (founder of Concannon Vineyard), and Charles Wetmore, a Portland Maine born American and pioneer of California,[79] (founder of Cresta Blanca Winery) recognized the areaÃ¢Â€Â™s winegrowing potential and bought land, planted grapes and founded their wineries in the 1880s.[80] Charles Wetmore went to France in 1878 when he was appointed a delegate for the California Viticultural Association to the Paris Exposition. Charles was able in 1882 to obtain Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscat de Bordelais cuttings from one of the most prestigious vineyards in France, Chateau Yquem. These superior clones helped revitalize the California wine industry. In 1889 Charles won the grand prize for his first pressing (1884) in the 1889 Paris Exposition. Charles shared these cuttings with other growers including C. H. Wente who used the Chateau Yquem grape cuttings to eventually produce their Chateau Wente wine., 56244=California became the 31st state in 1850 when California's non-Indian population jumped from about 8,000 in 1846 to about 120,000 in 1850 as shown in a corrected 1850 U.S. California Census.[21] California had enough population and enough wealth in 1850 that they by-passed the territorial status of most other states and were allowed to more or less choose their own (large) boundaries., 79344=The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department provides fire and advanced life support services to the cities of Livermore and Pleasanton. It serves an estimated population of 150,000 (Including 78,000 in Livermore, and 71,000 in Pleasanton) over 44 square miles (114Ã‚Â km2) (23 square miles (60Ã‚Â km2) in Livermore, and 21 square miles (54Ã‚Â km2) in Pleasanton) with an operating budget of $28,000,000. In 2008 the LPFD responded to approximately 11,000 calls for service. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) Local 1974 represents its 112 members., 71898=Camp Wonder opened its first summer camp for children with special medical needs in Livermore in 2001., 15220=Livermore (formerly Livermores, Livermore Ranch, and Nottingham)[9] is a city in Alameda County, California. Its estimated 2013 population was 85,156.[8] Livermore is located on the eastern edge of California's San Francisco Bay Area., 30088=Nearly all of the 14.6 inches (370Ã‚Â mm) of annual Livermore rainfall comes in the September to May time period, but about 50% of the days are sunny during this period with no appreciable cloud cover. The peak rainy months are December to March. Most rainstorms are classified as 50% light rain, 32% moderate rain, 11% heavy rain and less than 6% thunder showers.[12] The coldest months are December and January, with a mean high of about 56Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (13Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) and a low of about 38Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (3Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) with some occasional frost possible on clear mornings. The temperature can drop to as low as 20Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) to 25Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°F (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’4Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) range on an exceptionally cold night. Snow is very rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally in the valley., 68005=Livermore's culture retains some vestiges of the farming, wine growing and ranching traditions that have existed in the valley since the time of Robert Livermore, but now largely reflects a suburban population. Since 1918, Livermore has each June hosted the Livermore Rodeo,[30] called the ""World's Fastest Rodeo,"" that claims it has more riders per hour than any other event of its type. There are several wine tasting tours of the many Livermore area wineries that occur periodically throughout the summer. This culture was documented in the photoessay Suburbia in 1973 by then native photographer Bill Owens, with the photos shown in numerous exhibits.[31], 59425=Private grade schools were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute was founded in 1870 and the Union high school (later called Livermore High) in 1896 graduated its first class of students. Petroleum was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive coal deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad in what is now downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small bullring on many Sundays and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was thought then to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially incorporated by the state as a city on April 15, 1876. During Livermore's early years, it was also quite well known for large hotels that graced the downtown street corners, before new buildings replaced them. Livermore after the 1880s is also notable for the Wente Vineyards, Concannon Vineyard, Cresta Blanca Winery and Livermore's many other wineries. Since it has a Mediterranean climate, gravely soil, warm days and cool nights it was a good location to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the extensive winter wheat and hay crop lands were being replaced by vineyards. Extensive chromite deposits were found and exploited for a time. In 1885 the Remillard Brick Company was producing an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men. A telephone line connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886 and electric lights were introduced by 1889. By 1890 Livermore had over 20 miles (32Ã‚Â km) of streets.[24] Livermore originally had a Boot Hill called the Old Knoll Cemetery.[25], 70828=In 2010, proposed projects included extension of BART high-speed rail system to Livermore with an underground downtown station and a regional performing arts center between Livermore Avenue and L Street.[34]}",

BYU Family History Archive (www.lib.byu.edu/fhc)","Reference Tools and Other Helps You can find hundreds of valuable genealogical reference tools on the Internet, including maps, dictionaries, research guides, and library catalogs. Maps Because most records are kept, stored, cataloged, and retrieved according to geographic localities, it is vital to know precisely where your ancestor lived. Keep in mind that older maps may also be very important in genealogical research. Be careful to look at the date of maps you use, because boundaries may have changed from the time when your ancestor lived there. You may want to use a gazetteer first to determine where the place is located and then go to the appropriate map. Excellent resources for maps on the Internet include: Search engines (images.google.com). Enter a place-name with the word Ã¢Â€Âœmap,Ã¢Â€? and available maps are often quicklydisplayed. For example, if you are researching in New York, you could enter Ã¢Â€ÂœNew York mapsÃ¢Â€? in the search box. Or if you want a more specific map, you might want to try something like Ã¢Â€Âœcolonial New York mapsÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœNew York counties mapÃ¢Â€? as search terms. There are also Web sites made specifically for maps, such as www.mapblast.com and www.mapquest.com. Geographic Names Information System (geonames.usgs.gov/). This Web site links to specific maps.

La Corporation des pilotes du Saint-Laurent central et la Corporation des Pilotes du Bas Saint-Laurent regroupent les quelque 200 pilotes qui naviguent entre QuÃƒÂ©bec et MontrÃƒÂ©al pour la premiÃƒÂ¨re et entre Les Escoumins et QuÃƒÂ©bec pour la seconde., 16778=LÃ¢Â€Â™explorateur franÃƒÂ§ais Jacques Cartier (XVIe siÃƒÂ¨cle) attribue d'abord le nom de Saint-Laurent au fleuve le jour de la fÃƒÂªte de Laurent de Rome, fÃƒÂªtÃƒÂ© le 10 aoÃƒÂ»t, lors de son deuxiÃƒÂ¨me voyage en 1535-1536, ÃƒÂ  l'embouchure du fleuve qu'il croit alors ÃƒÂªtre un simple golfe de la CÃƒÂ´te-NordÃ‚Â : la Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â baye sainct LaurensÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». Par suite, il s'aperÃƒÂ§oit de son erreur et remonte ce que les Autochtones dÃƒÂ©signent sous le nom de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â la RiviÃƒÂ¨re qui marcheÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», et qu'il baptise Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Grand fleuve de HochelagaÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[1],[2]. Par la suite, le terme Saint-Laurent s'est aussi appliquÃƒÂ© au fleuve, qui sera plus connu sous le nom de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Grande riviÃƒÂ¨re de CanadaÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» au XVIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle. En 1603, Samuel de Champlain a d'abord dÃƒÂ©signÃƒÂ© ce cours d'eau sous le nom de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â riviere de CanadasÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», mais aprÃƒÂ¨s 1604, le fondateur de QuÃƒÂ©bec opta pour Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â grande riviere de sainct LaurensÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â fleuve sainct LaurensÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» dans ses ÃƒÂ©crits et sur ses cartes[3],[4]. C'est donc au XVIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle que le toponyme Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Fleuve Saint-LaurentÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» a fini par supplanter ses concurrents[3], qui furent au fils des ansÃ‚Â :, 59473=Il fallait donc trouver une solution pour assurer la protection des vaisseaux et des ÃƒÂ©quipages qui sÃ¢Â€Â™engageaient dans le Saint-Laurent. CÃ¢Â€Â™est ainsi que le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-France a eu recours ÃƒÂ  des pilotes expÃƒÂ©rimentÃƒÂ©s, qui connaissaient bien tous les piÃƒÂ¨ges du fleuve, pour guider les navires. Un premier pilote du roi est nommÃƒÂ© vers 1640, il s'agit d'Abraham Martin, celui-lÃƒÂ  mÃƒÂªme qui laissa son prÃƒÂ©nom aux plaines dÃ¢Â€Â™Abraham, ÃƒÂ  QuÃƒÂ©bec. En 1671, le CollÃƒÂ¨ge des JÃƒÂ©suites de QuÃƒÂ©bec offre les premiers cours pour former des pilotes maritimes spÃƒÂ©cialisÃƒÂ©s dans la navigation sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent. AprÃƒÂ¨s la conquÃƒÂªte anglaise, le gouvernement colonial maintiendra lÃ¢Â€Â™obligation de confier les navires aux soins des pilotes maritimes[18]., 39430=En 1534, le malouin Jacques Cartier en prend possession officiellement au nom du roi de France FranÃƒÂ§ois Ier.

DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  au XVIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les FranÃƒÂ§ais avaient l'habitude de nommer ce fleuve Saint-Laurent en amont de la ville de MontrÃƒÂ©al et de la riviÃƒÂ¨re des Outaouais. Le Saint-Laurent a servi d'itinÃƒÂ©raire principal pour l'exploration de l'intÃƒÂ©rieur du nord de l'AmÃƒÂ©rique., 46725=Il fallut attendre la construction du canal de Lachine en 1825 puis le dragage du fleuve entre QuÃƒÂ©bec et MontrÃƒÂ©al ÃƒÂ  partir de 1851 pour que la navigation commerciale puisse enfin se dÃƒÂ©velopper.

Said chapter 15A is hereby further amended by adding the following 2 sections:- Section 42. (a) The board of trustees of each state university shall, for each academic year, fix and establish student charges for each such state university, subject to the requirements of this section. In-state student charges shall preserve affordability for residents of the commonwealth. Out-of-state student charges shall appropriately balance the financial needs of the college with the need to be competitive with peer institutions regionally. In setting student charges, each state university shall consider factors including, but not limited to, actual appropriations received, the Consumer Price Index, the Higher Education Price Index, tuition and fee rates at peer institutions, collective bargaining costs, funding from the commonwealth measured with reference to the funding formula established in section 15B and making progress towards ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. To the extent practicable, final student charges shall be established for each academic year not later than March 1 of the calendar year in which the rates shall take effect. For the purposes of this section, Ã¢Â€Âœstudent chargesÃ¢Â€? shall include tuition and fees that are charged to students generally for attendance at a state university, but shall not include any fee or other charge established by such state university that is specific to a particular course, program or activity, and shall not include any rates, rents, charges or fees set by the Massachusetts State College Building Authority. (b) Each state university shall submit a 3-year student charges plan to the board of higher education for the boardÃ¢Â€Â™s approval. The plan shall contain the annual student charges that the state university expects to approve for the state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s state-supported programs under subsection (a) for a period of not fewer than 3 academic years. The plan shall also include, but not be limited to, budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of segmental missions and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups. The board of higher education, in considering whether to approve a plan, shall consider, but not be limited to considering, the same factors the campuses are required to consider in setting student charges under this section. For the first 3 years, the board may also consider, to the extent practicable, any steps taken in the plan to ensure that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. For the second 3 years and for each plan submitted thereafter, the board shall consider the progress made toward ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. Within 120 days after submission of a plan, the board of higher education shall either approve the plan or return it to the state university with suggested changes. The approval shall require a 2/3 vote of the board of higher education. If the board of higher education does not vote on a plan within 120 days after its submission, the plan shall be considered approved. A copy of the plan shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education at the time the plan is submitted to the board of higher education. (c) If following the approval of a state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s plan under subsection (b) the board of trustees of such state university approves, for any academic year, student charges that are greater than 105 per cent of the student charges approved in such universityÃ¢Â€Â™s plan, the state university shall submit such greater rate to the board of higher education for its approval as part of an amended student charges plan. The amended plan shall describe in detail the reasons why the state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s student charges are greater than the expected student charges and shall provide revised or updated information on budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of segmental missions and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups, as necessary. Within 60 days after the submission of a revised plan, the board of higher education shall either approve the plan or return it to the state university with suggested changes.

Allow Medical Security Trust Fund Deficit for Fiscal Year 2013, 26080=The Senate Ways and Means Committee does not rely on tax increases to balance its budget.Ã‚Â  As with the GovernorÃ¢Â€Â™s budget recommendations and the recent House budget, the Committee budget assumes ongoing tax revenues of $21.95 billion Ã¢Â€Â“ an increase of $940 million over the projected FY 2012 amount. Ã‚Â This projected revenue increase of 4.47% is indicative of a steady, albeit slow, economic recovery which enables us to avoid many of the painful spending cuts made in recent years. Ã‚Â  All told, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes $32.275 billion in spending; an increase of 3.7% over FY 2012 projected spending.Ã‚Â  The spending increase is the result of non-discretionary increases in labor, utilities and other costs, as well as new targeted investments.Ã‚Â  Even with these increases in spending, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes a number of year-to-year spending reductions necessary to live within our means.Ã‚Â  Of the line items in this budget, 54% have been reduced or level-funded from their FY 2012 GAA level. The most notable spending increases in the Senate Ways and Means budget are in local aid, education and fixed costs, such as debt service, retiree benefits and health care.Ã‚Â  Combined, these spending areas increase $1.1 billion over the FY 2012 level.Ã‚Â  As a result, all other areas of the budget combined increase by less than $50 million.Ã‚Â  As bleak as those spending numbers seem, they stand in sharp contrast to the previous three budgets that saw year-to-year funding in non-discretionary spending slashed. In many ways, the revenue assumptions and spending choices made in this budget anticipate FY 2013 to be one of transition.Ã‚Â  Stronger revenue growth gives us additional resources to avoid spending cuts, while, at the same time, continuing uncertainty requires us to focus not on program expansion, but on beginning to restore the devastation of recent years., 1298916=SECTION 150. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, no grant applications shall be accepted by the executive office of health and human services under item 4000-0005 of section 2 or by the executive office of education for grants distributed under item 7009-6400 of said section 2 in fiscal year 2013 prior to the competitive selection of an independent program evaluator by each administering agency. The independent evaluator chosen for each program shall provide assistance with the evaluation of grant applications and, to the extent possible, in developing the requirements for grant recipients. The independent evaluator shall be responsible for a multi-year evaluation of each programÃ¢Â€Â™s implementation and outcomes; provided that the evaluator shall be responsible for evaluation design. Each program shall select an evaluator based on a competitive process. The selected evaluator shall demonstrate: (i) prior experience in evaluating the impact of social programs on low-income urban youth and communities using either random assignment of treatment or regression discontinuity methods; (ii) prior experience in field evaluation; and (iii) demonstrated skill in using quantitative analysis relevant for program evaluation. When selecting an independent evaluator, the administering agency shall consider: (1) a sample of previous similar work; (2) the ability to perform requested services; and (3) a proposed evaluation budget; provided, however, that the administering agency shall give preference to non-profit research organizations. Each administering agency shall develop a request for proposal for program evaluators based on the criteria included in this section not later than August 15, 2012 and shall select an evaluator not later than October 1, 2012. Once selected, evaluators shall assist the administering agency with reviewing, and to the extent possible, developing requests for proposal for grant funds that ensure that grant recipients: (A) fully cooperate with the independent evaluator; (B) commit to seeking the informed consent of program clients and their families to share data relevant to evaluation; and (C) provide access to program and administrative data necessary for evaluation. The evaluators shall provide quarterly progress updates to the house and senate committees on ways and means that shall inform the committees on the progress of implementing the evaluation plan and shall identify in those updates any obstacles encountered in implementing the evaluation plan; provided, however, that the first quarterly report shall detail the evaluation plan for each program, data required for analysis and outcomes measured. The evaluators shall provide an annual report not later than March 15 of each year of the evaluation period to report on relevant findings and analysis., 37195=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to those in Need, 1305404=SECTION 152. There shall be a special commission to study access to public assistance and state-sponsored services in rural areas. The commission shall consist of 13 members including: the secretary of health and human services or a designee, who shall serve as the chair; the commissioner of transitional assistance or a designee; the child advocate or a designee; the secretary of elder affairs or a designee; the undersecretary of housing and community development or a designee; the commissioner of early education and care or a designee; a representative from the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers; a representative from ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Trust Fund; a representative from the Massachusetts Association of Community Action Centers; a representative from the Massachusetts Model of Community Coalitions; a representative of Mass Home Care; a representative from a food bank or food pantry located in the commonwealth, appointed by the governor; and a representative of the CitizensÃ¢Â€Â™ Housing and Planning Association. The commission shall examine the barriers faced by low- to moderate-income individuals living in rural areas to obtain public assistance and state-sponsored services including, but not limited to, fuel assistance, child care subsidies, direct cash assistance, emergency housing services and health and human service programs which provide services to children, families, persons with disabilities and elders. The commissionÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of traveling to and from regional offices, the cost of delivering services in rural areas and the success of outreach efforts in rural communities. The commission shall investigate the feasibility of coordinating delivery of services between local and state agencies, expanding the use of technology to increase access to services and eliminating application requirements for in-person visits to state agencies. The commission shall file the results of its study, together with drafts of legislation, if any, necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, with the house and senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities and the joint committee on elder affairs not later than April 1, 2013., 50123=The recession of 2008-2011 has forced us as a state to reevaluate our shared priorities and improve our ability to ensure that when the next fiscal crisis comes, we are best positioned to respond to it.Ã‚Â  The Senate, in conjunction with the House and the Governor, has prioritized changing the way we budget to rebuild our reserves, better control spending and improve our fiscal discipline. Ã‚Â  Over the last 2 years, we have implemented new provisions to ensure that volatile revenue sources, such as capital gains revenues over $1 billion and tax settlements, are not built into operating revenues, but instead are deposited directly into the stabilization fund.Ã‚Â  By the end of FY 2013, these two provisions alone will increase stabilization fund deposits by more than $300 million. Ã‚Â  The ability to build our reserves has been complemented by notable successes in controlling health care and other costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, MassHealth costs are expected to grow just under 2% from FY 2011.Ã‚Â  In contrast, between FY 2010 and FY 2011 those same costs grew by 10.2%.Ã‚Â  In addition, the Committee budget, like House 2 and the House budget, rely on greater than anticipated FY 2011 and FY 2012 savings in the Group Insurance Commission and the Health Connector to offset costs in FY 2013.Ã‚Â  Without these recent successes in limiting health care cost growth, many of the investments included in this budget would be impossible. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s FY 2013 budget recommendations reflect an understanding that the work we have done in managing resources and controlling cost growth is only the beginning and must be sustained to continue our recovery.Ã‚Â  To that end, this budget:, 1279786=SECTION 139. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, on or before October 1, 2012 and without further appropriation, the comptroller shall transfer from the General Fund to the Health Safety Net Trust Fund, established in section 36 of chapter 118G of the General Laws, in this section called the fund, the greater of $45,000,000 or one-twelfth of the total expenditures to hospitals and community health centers required pursuant to this act, for the purposes of making initial gross payments to qualifying acute care hospitals for the hospital fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. These payments shall be made to hospitals before, and in anticipation of, the payment by hospitals of their gross liability to the fund. The comptroller shall transfer from the fund to the General Fund on or before June 30, 2013, the amount of the transfer authorized by this section and any allocation of that amount as certified by the director of the health safety net office., 34808=Finally, the Committee budget includes $4 million for the Community Innovation Grant Program which provides grants to municipalities to cover the startup costs of initiatives that will improve service delivery, promote regionalization and reduce costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, 28 municipal projects Ã¢Â€Â“ ranging from the merger of municipal public safety services to the creation of a smart phone app that will help people access municipal services Ã¢Â€Â“ have been funded.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013 this program will not only evaluate and track existing awards, but will support new areas of municipal innovation., 1237596=SECTION 111. The salary adjustments and other cost items authorized by the 2011 amendments to the following collective bargaining agreements, for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014, inclusive, shall be effective for the purposes of section 7 of chapter 150E of the General Laws: (a) between the commonwealth and the Coalition for Public Safety, Unit 5, at the alcoholic beverages control commission; (b) between the commonwealth and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, Unit 9; and (c) between the commonwealth and Lottery - SEIU Local 888 (Unit LT1)., 1247185=SECTION 118. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation may incur liabilities and make expenditures in fiscal year 2013 in excess of funds available to the department for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that such expenditures shall be approved by the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of administration and finance; provided further, that no expenses shall be made in excess of funds available until $50,000,000 has been expended for snow and ice removal in fiscal year 2013; provided further, that the negative balance of funds available for snow and ice removal shall not exceed $30,000,000 at any time; and provided further, that the state comptroller may certify for payment invoices in excess of funds available to the department. (b) The department shall, on or before May 1, 2013, report to the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means the total amounts budgeted and expended for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that the department shall seek appropriations, as required, to cure deficiencies resulting from the removal of snow and ice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013., 1261113=SECTION 125. Notwithstanding section 22N of chapter 7 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the bureau of purchased services within the operational services division shall set prices in fiscal year 2013 for programs under chapter 71B of the General Laws at the same level calculated for fiscal year 2012, except the prices for those programs for extraordinary relief, as defined by the divisionÃ¢Â€Â™s regulations; provided, however, that upon the request of a program, the bureau shall determine the minimum price for out-of-state purchasers by identifying the most recent price calculated for the program and applying the estimated rate of inflation, established by October 1 of each year under said section 22N of said chapter 7, in a compounded manner for each fiscal year following the most recent calculated price. The bureau shall accept and process applications for program reconstruction for fiscal year 2013 to be considered for rate adjustment in fiscal year 2014. Programs for which prices in fiscal year 2012 were lower than the full amount permitted by the operational services division may, in fiscal year 2013, change the full prices calculated for fiscal year 2012., 53286=Twelve months ago, this Committee grappled with closing a $1.9 billion budget gap in the midst of the loss of $1.5 billion in federal stimulus funds and a stabilization fund balance approaching its lowest level in nine years.Ã‚Â  Working with our partners in the House and in the Administration, we closed that gap and more than doubled the stabilization fund balance.Ã‚Â  That work, which resulted in historic highs for the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s bond rating, serves as a template for how this Committee will approach our budget challenges in FY 2013 and beyond., 1009122=SECTION 2E. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The sums set forth in this section are hereby appropriated for transfer from the General Fund to the trust funds named within each item unless specifically designated otherwise in this section, for the purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this section and subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public funds for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Items in this section shall not be subject to allotment under section 9B of chapter 29 of the General Laws or reduction under section 9C of said chapter 29, without express authorization from the general court. Notwithstanding section 19A of said chapter 29, any transfer under this section shall be made by the comptroller in accordance with a transfer schedule to be developed for each item by the comptroller, after consulting with the appropriate agency secretary, the secretary of administration and finance and the state treasurer. The schedule for each appropriation shall provide for transfers in increments considered appropriate to meet the cash flow needs of each fund and all transfers under the schedule shall be completed not later than June 30, 2013. Not later than 7 days after the schedules receive final approval by the comptroller, they shall be reported to the house and senate committees on ways and means, 1282191=SECTION 141. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, there shall be an independent commission to study the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s inpatient and community mental health services. The commission shall consist of 7 members, 1 of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, who shall serve as co-chair; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the president of the senate, who shall serve as co-chair; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the minority leader of the senate; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the governor; and 2 of whom shall be selected by the co-chairs, of whom 1 shall be selected from a list of 3 nominees provided by the Massachusetts Chapter of the National Alliance of Mental Illness who have demonstrated experience with the commonwealth-funded mental health service delivery system and 1 shall be selected from a list of 3 nominees provided by the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society who have demonstrated experience in evaluation and research of the commonwealth-funded mental health delivery system. The report shall include, but not be limited to: (i) a comprehensive assessment of the inpatient and community-based needs of mental health services funded through the department of mental health, including an estimate of the appropriate number of inpatient beds given the current number of community placements; (ii) the anticipated impact of the closure Taunton State Hospital on the mental health needs of the southeastern region of the commonwealth; and (iii) legislative or other recommendations to maintain and improve the quality of mental health services funded through the department. The department shall provide any information requested by the commission in order to further the purposes of the commission; provided, however, that such information shall not be provided to the commission if the information would violate the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The commission shall submit the results of its study, together with drafts of legislation, if any, necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, by filing the same with the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of administration and finance, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the chairs of the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse not later than December 28, 2012., 1245826=SECTION 115. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, not later than June 30, 2013, the treasurer shall transfer $10,000,000 from the eminent domain trust fund established under section 7D of chapter 79 of the General Laws to the Unclaimed Property Fund established in section 9 of chapter 200A of the General Laws.

Beginning in calendar year 2013, the amount retained and expended by the department in the previous fiscal year shall be certified by the secretary of administration and finance and submitted to the house and senate committees on ways and means annually not later than July 15., 1168500=Section 5M. (a) As used in this section, Ã¢Â€ÂœorganizationÃ¢Â€? shall mean a corporation for profit or not-for-profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity; provided, however, that Ã¢Â€ÂœorganizationÃ¢Â€? shall not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (b) An organization that obtains, uses, transfers or disposes of food stamp benefits in the manner specified in subsection (c) shall be guilty of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking.

Ã‚Â§ 2011, as amended, or the regulations of the department, or who presents for payment or redemption food stamp benefits that have been received, transferred, altered or used in violation of this section shall be guilty of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking. (d) If an organization is alleged to have committed the offense of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking 2 or more times within a 6-month period, any of those offenses may be aggregated and charged in a single count and the offenses so aggregated and charged shall constitute a single offense.

Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, the Senate budget made clear that balancing the budget could not come at the expense of maintaining mental health services in the Commonwealth.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013, the Committee budget includes strong provisions to ensure that all regions of the state have adequate access to community and inpatient mental health services by ensuring that 45 state-operated inpatient beds remain in Southeastern Massachusetts as an independent commission examines the appropriate level of state mental health services.Ã‚Â  Maintaining regional coverage, combined with the opening of the new state of the art Worcester State Hospital, will substantially improve both the depth and scope of mental health services in the Commonwealth. In addition to mental health, the Committee budget continues to prioritize ensuring that those with physical disabilities have access to the services they need.Ã‚Â  This budget provides additional funding for Independent Living Centers as well as Turning 22 programs for both blind and developmentally delayed clients.Ã‚Â  While each of these programs serves a distinct population, they share the common theme of providing care and assistance to those of us who face the steepest challenges. The Senate has also been a leader in expanding services for those with substance abuse issues and their families.Ã‚Â  The research is clear: proactively using resources to help people overcome substance abuse problems saves lives and families, and is far less costly than waiting for those same substance abusers to develop other chronic medical conditions or enter the criminal justice system.Ã‚Â  Over the past year, the Senate has provided new resources to the Department of Public Health to develop new treatment programs, changed the process by which substance abusers can be civilly committed to treatment facilities and made it more difficult to illegally obtain prescription narcotics.Ã‚Â  This budget builds on those efforts by providing:, 1219126=SECTION 90. Section 150 of said chapter 149, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ33EÃ¢Â€?, in line 20, the following figure:- , 33F. Criminal Defendant Indigency Verification, 1230682=SECTION 103. Section 220 of said chapter 68 is hereby amended by striking out the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ2012Ã¢Â€? and inserting in place thereof the following figure:- 2013., 786517=SECTION 2B. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the agencies listed in this section may expend the amounts listed in this section for the provision of services to agencies listed in section 2. All expenditures made under this section shall be accompanied by a corresponding transfer of funds from an account listed in section 2 to the Intragovernmental Service Fund, established by section 2Q of chapter 29 of the General Laws. All revenues and other inflows shall be based on rates published by the seller agency that are developed in accordance with cost principles established by the United States Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments. All rates shall be published within 30 days of the enactment of this section. No expenditures shall be made from the Intragovernmental Service Fund which would cause that fund to be in deficit at the close of fiscal year 2013. All authorizations in this section shall be charged to the Intragovernmental Service Fund and shall not be subject to section 5D of chapter 29 of the General Laws. Any balance remaining in that fund at the close of fiscal year 2013 shall be transferred to the General Fund., 1238328=SECTION 112. The salary adjustments and other cost items authorized by the 2011 amendments to the following collective bargaining agreements, for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014, inclusive, shall be effective for the purposes of section 7 of chapter 150E of the General Laws: (a) between the Essex sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers, for Local R1-27 (Unit SE3); (b) between the Barnstable sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, for Local 220 (Unit S5B); (c) between the Barnstable sheriff and the AFL-CIO Council 93, for Local 1462C (Unit S2B); (d) between the Barnstable sheriff and the Barnstable Correctional Officers Union (Unit S1B); (e) between the Barnstable sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers, for Local 217 (Unit S3B); (f) between the Barnstable sheriff and the National Association for Government Employees, for Local 58 (Unit S4B); (g) between the Dukes sheriff and Massachusetts Correctional Officers Federated Union (Unit SD1); (h) between the Suffolk sheriff and the and American Federation of State Council and Municipal Employees, for Council 3967 and 3642, Suffolk Captains (Unit SS6 and SS5); (i) between the Essex sheriff and the Essex correction officers (Unit SE2); (j) between the board of higher education and the Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 93, Local 1067 (Unit 106); (k) between the Berkshire sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers/AFL-CIO, Local RI-297 (Unit SB1); (l) between the Berkshire sheriff and the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers - Communications Workers of America (Unit SB2); (m) between the Berkshire sheriffÃ¢Â€Â™s department and the Berkshire County Sheriff's Office Employees Association (Unit SB3); (n) between the Suffolk sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, Local 298 (Unit SS2); (o) between the Middlesex sheriff and the New England Police Benevolent Association/AFL-CIO, Local 500 (Unit SM5); (p) between the Norfolk sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, RI-202 (Unit SN1); (q) between the Suffolk sheriff and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees/AFL-CIO, Council 93, Local RN (Unit SS3); (r) between the Plymouth county sheriff and the Massachusetts Correctional Officers Federated Union, Emergency Communications Center Unit (Unit SP5); (s) between the University of Massachusetts and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers (Unit D84), for the Dartmouth campus; (t) between the University of Massachusetts and the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1895, AFL-CIO, Educational Services Unit (Unit D85), for the Dartmouth campus; (u) between the University of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Society of Professors/Faculty Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units A50 and B40); (v) between the University of Massachusetts and the University Staff Association/MTA/NEA (Unit A08), for the Amherst campus; (w) between the University of Massachusetts and the Non-Exempt Supervisors Unit, Unit B/MTA/NEA (Unit A15), for the Amherst campus; (x) between the University of Massachusetts and the Professional Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units A52 and B42), for the Amherst and Boston campuses; (y) between the University of Massachusetts and the Classified Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units B31 and B32), for the Boston campus; (z) between the University of Massachusetts and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 507, AFL-CIO (Unit D82), for the Dartmouth campus; (aa) between the University of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Society of Professors/Lowell/MTA/NEA (Unit L90); (bb) between the University of Massachusetts and the MTA/NEA Clerical/Technical Unit (Unit L92), for the Lowell campus; (cc) between the University of Massachusetts and the MTA/NEA Maintenance/Trades Unit (Unit L93), for the Lowell campus; (dd) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association Associated Professional Administrators (Unit APA); (ee) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association State College Faculty (Unit MSC); (ff) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association Associated Massachusetts Community Colleges Council (Unit MCC); (gg) between the commonwealth and the registry of deeds (Unit SC1-6); (hh) between the University of Massachusetts and the Amherst Council 93, Local 1776, AFL-CIOs (Unit A01), for the Amherst campus; (ii) between the University of Massachusetts and the Service Employees International Union, Local 888 (Unit L95), for the Lowell campus; and (jj) between the Suffolk sheriff and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for Council 93, Local 419 (Unit SS0). DOR Tax Judgment and Settlement Expenses, 1275196=SECTION 137. (a) Notwithstanding section 53 of chapter 118E of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013, the executive office of health and human services may determine the extent to which to include within its covered services for adults the federally-optional dental services that were included in its state plan or demonstration program in effect on January 1, 2002 and the dental services that were covered for adults in the MassHealth basic program as of January 1, 2002; provided, however, that notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, at least 90 days before restructuring any MassHealth dental benefits, the executive office shall file a report with the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means detailing the proposed changes and the anticipated fiscal impact of such changes.

Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 the distribution to cities and towns of the balance of the State Lottery Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the second paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General Fund shall be $900,000,000 and shall be apportioned to the cities and towns in accordance with this section. Notwithstanding section 2 of chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, except for section 12B of chapter 76 and section 89 of chapter 71 of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city and town from item 7061-0008 of section 2 shall be as set forth in the following lists. The specified amounts to be distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said section 2 shall be in full satisfaction of the amounts due under chapter 70 of the General Laws. For fiscal year 2013, the foundation budget categories for each district shall be calculated in the same manner as in fiscal year 2012. The target local share shall be calculated using the same methodology used in fiscal year 2012. Preliminary local contribution shall be the municipality's fiscal year 2012 minimum required local contribution, increased or decreased by the municipal revenue growth factor; provided, that if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 5 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 1 percentage point; and if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 10 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 2 percentage points. Minimum required local contribution for fiscal year 2013 shall be, for any municipality with a fiscal year 2013 preliminary contribution greater than its fiscal year 2013 target contribution, the preliminary local contribution reduced by 15 per cent of the gap between the preliminary local contribution and the target local contribution. Required local contribution shall be allocated among the districts to which a municipality belongs in direct proportion to the foundation budgets for the municipality's pupils at each of those districts. For fiscal year 2013, ""prior year aid"" shall be fiscal year 2012 state-appropriated chapter 70 aid. Ã‚Â For fiscal year 2013, the ""foundation aid increment"" shall be the difference between: (1) the positive difference between a district's foundation budget and its required district contribution; and (2) prior year aid. For fiscal year 2013, chapter 70 aid shall be: (a) for any district that: (i) has a target aid percentage greater than the sum of a districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid and foundation aid increment as a percentage of foundation budget; and (ii) has a combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation budget of not more than 107.5 per cent; Ã‚Â the sum of prior year aid and 25 per cent of the difference between the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s target aid amount and the sum of prior year aid and the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; (b) for any district with a positive foundation aid increment not included in (a), the sum of the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid plus the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; and (c) for all other districts: the sum of foundation enrollment multiplied by 40 plus prior year aid. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for districts shall be determined by dividing the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield by the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s total foundation budget. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for regional school districts shall be determined by allocating a member municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield among the districts to which said municipality belongs in direct proportion to the foundation budgets for the municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s pupils at each of those districts. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the district's foundation budget. If there is a conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below, the distribution below shall control., 1172309=SECTION 52. Chapter 22C of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out section 39, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following 3 sections:-, 21571=In fiscal year 2012, the legislature established an expedited process for cities and towns to realize tens of millions of dollars of savings through municipal health care reform.Ã‚Â  This yearÃ¢Â€Â™s spending plan continues our unfaltering commitment to cities, towns, and school districts by proposing a $275 million increase in local aid over fiscal year 2012.Ã‚Â  An investment in our communities is an investment in programs that improve infrastructure, put people to work, and strengthen our economy. In the face of persistent unemployment and slow job growth, this budget makes an investment in the future of our economy.Ã‚Â  By investing in ways to better connect our public higher education system to our workforce needs, we aim to meet the demands of the growing job sectors., 1260594=SECTION 124. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department of elementary and secondary education shall adopt regulations to certify district costs related to transportation of homeless students under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11431 et seq. The department shall adopt the regulations required by this section not later than December 1, 2012. Private SPED Tuition Rate Freeze, 1200910=Section 8A. (a) The board of trustees shall fix and establish student charges for the university. In-state tuition and mandatory student charges shall preserve affordability for residents of the commonwealth. Out-of-state student charges shall appropriately balance the financial needs of the university with the need to be competitive with peer institutions regionally. In establishing student charges the board shall consider factors including, but not limited to, actual appropriations received, the Consumer Price Index, the Higher Education Price Index, tuition and fee rates at peer institutions, collective bargaining costs, funding from the commonwealth measured with reference to the funding formula established in section 15B of chapter 15A and making progress toward ensuring that fees constitute no more than 25 per cent of student charges. To the extent practicable, final student charges shall be established for each academic year not later than March 1 of the calendar year in which the rates shall take effect. For the purposes of this section, Ã¢Â€Âœstudent chargesÃ¢Â€? shall mean tuition and fees that are charged to students generally for attendance at the university, but shall not include any fee or other charge established by the university that is specific to a particular course, program or activity, and shall not include any charges for room or board. (b) The university shall submit a 3-year student charges plan to the board of higher education for the boardÃ¢Â€Â™s information consistent with this section. The plan shall contain the annual student charges that the university expects to approve for the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s state-supported programs under the process in subsection (a) for a period of not less than 3 academic years, which shall be the period of the plan. The plan shall also include, but not be limited to, budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of the mission of each university campus and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups. A copy of the plan shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education at the time the plan is submitted to the board of higher education. Notwithstanding the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s obligation to update the plan every 3 years, the university may, from time-to-time, provide a modified plan, under the process provided in subsection (a). If the board of trustees determines that a modification of the 3-year plan is necessary, the trustees shall submit the modified plan to the board of higher education, the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education, with an explanation for the rationale behind any modifications. (c) All student charges received by the board of trustees under this section shall be retained by the university in a revolving trust fund and shall be expended as the board of trustees may direct for the operation and support of the institution. Any balance in a trust fund at the end of a fiscal year shall continue to be held in the trust fund, shall remain available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years and shall not revert to the General Fund. All such trust funds shall be subject to audit by the state auditor., 1251391=SECTION 121. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the amounts transferred pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 22C of chapter 32 of the General Laws shall be made available for the commonwealth's Pension Liability Fund established in section 22 of said chapter 32. The amounts transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section 22C of said chapter 32 shall meet the commonwealth's obligations pursuant to said section 22C of said chapter 32, including retirement benefits payable by the state employees' and the state teachers' retirement systems, for the costs associated with a 3 per cent cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to section 102 of said chapter 32, for the reimbursement of local retirement systems for previously authorized cost-of-living adjustments pursuant to said section 102 of said chapter 32 and for the costs of increased survivor benefits pursuant to chapter 389 of the acts of 1984. The state board of retirement and each city, town, county and district shall verify these costs, subject to the rules adopted by the state treasurer. The state treasurer may make payments upon a transfer of funds to reimburse certain municipalities for pensions to retired teachers, including any other obligations which the commonwealth has assumed on behalf of any retirement system other than the state employees' or state teachers' retirement systems and the commonwealth's share of the amounts to be transferred pursuant to section 22B of said chapter 32 and the amounts to be transferred pursuant to clause (a) of the last paragraph of section 21 of chapter 138 of the General Laws. All payments for the purposes described in this section shall be made only pursuant to distribution of monies from the fund, and any distribution and the payments for which distributions are required shall be detailed in a written report filed quarterly by the secretary of administration and finance with the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on public service in advance of this distribution. Distributions shall not be made in advance of the date on which a payment is actually to be made. The state board of retirement may expend an amount for the purposes of the board of higher education's optional retirement program pursuant to section 40 of chapter 15A of the General Laws. To the extent that the amount transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section 22C of said chapter 32 exceeds the amount necessary to adequately fund the annual pension obligations, the excess amount shall be credited to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund, established by subdivision (8) of section 22 of said chapter 32, for the purpose of reducing the unfunded pension liability of the commonwealth., 24018=The Senate Ways and Means fiscal year 2013 budget reflects the changing landscape of how state government functions within the context of our recent economic past.Ã‚Â  Our budget clearly illustrates two vital lessons that we have learned over the past four difficult years.Ã‚Â  First, this budget emphasizes fiscal sustainability, understanding that the investments we make today are ineffective if we are unable to protect them in the crisis of tomorrow.Ã‚Â  Second, this budget prioritizes investments to help understand how we can use available resources in a way that maximizes programmatic efficiency and positive outcomes. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s budget applies these lessons in the midst of another challenging fiscal environment.Ã‚Â  In spite of these difficult times, the Committee budget attempts to minimize painful program cuts and make a number of new investments in education, housing and workforce development.Ã‚Â  Investments in these three areas have been instrumental in an economic recovery that has outpaced that of other states.Ã‚Â  More importantly, investments in these areas will largely define our ability to prosper in the future. The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget closes a $1.4 billion budget gap with a combination of ongoing revenue initiatives, one-time resources and spending reductions.Ã‚Â  For a second consecutive year, the Committee has been able to close the gap without an overreliance on one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  In fiscal year 2011, the state required $1.8 billion in these one-time solutions to close the budget.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012 and FY 2013 combined, the state will use less than $1 billion in one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  Over that same time period, the state has begun to rebuild its reserves, increasing the balance of the Stabilization Fund from $670 million at the end of FY 2010, to a projected balance of $1.19 billion at the end of FY 2013., 1122559=Section 5B. (a) Any person who: (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; (2) knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; (3) conspires to commit a violation of this subsection; (4) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of section 1128B of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b, or section 41 of chapter 118E; (5) has possession, custody or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof less than all of that property or money; (6) is authorized to make or deliver a document certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, by the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof and, with the intent of defrauding the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, makes or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true; (7) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, who may not lawfully sell or pledge such property; (8) enters into an agreement, contract or understanding with an official of the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof knowing the information contained therein is false; (9) knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or to transmit money or property to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof; or (10) is a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, or is a beneficiary of an overpayment from the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, and who subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim or the receipt of overpayment and fails to disclose the false claim or receipt of overpayment to the commonwealth or a political subdivision by the later of: (i) the date which is 60 days after the date on which the false claim or receipt of overpayment was identified; or (ii) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable, shall be liable to the commonwealth or political subdivision for a civil penalty of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 per violation, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-410 section 5, 104 Stat. 891, note following 28 U.S.C. section 2461, plus 3 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustains because of such violation. A person violating sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also be liable to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof for the expenses of the civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â€Â™ fees, reasonable expert fees and the costs of investigation, as set forth below. Costs recoverable under said sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also include the costs of any review or investigation undertaken by the attorney general, or by the state auditor or the inspector general in cooperation with the attorney general. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if the court finds that: (1) the person committing the violation of subsection (a) furnished an official of the office of the attorney general investigating a false claims law violation with all the information known to such person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the person first obtained the information; (2) such person fully cooperated with any commonwealth investigation of such violation; and (3) at the time such person furnished the commonwealth with the information about the violation, no civil action or administrative action had commenced under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, or no criminal prosecution had commenced with respect to such violation, and such person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation, the court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustained because of the act of that person. (c) A corporation, partnership or other person shall be liable to the commonwealth under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, for the acts of its agent where the agent acted with apparent authority, regardless of whether the agent acted, in whole or in part, to benefit the principal and regardless of whether the principal adopted or ratified the agent's claims, representation, statement or other action or conduct. (d) Sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall not apply to claims, records or statements made or presented to establish, limit, reduce or evade liability for the payment of tax to the commonwealth or other governmental authority. (e) A person who has engaged in conduct described in subsection (a) prior to payment shall only be entitled to payment from the commonwealth of the actual amount due less the excess amount falsely or fraudulently claimed., 1228550=SECTION 97. Section 23 of chapter 5 of the acts of 2009 is hereby amended by striking out the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ2012Ã¢Â€?, inserted by section 137 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following figure:- 2013., 1228306=SECTION 96. Subsection (b) of section 75 of chapter 303 of the acts of 2008 shall not apply in fiscal year 2013., 20737=Fiscal year 2013 will mark the fifth year of unprecedented fiscal challenges. Although our economy has seen modest growth, it is as important now as ever before to continue our fiscal prudence.Ã‚Â  We will once again rise to this challenge with a balanced approach of creative solutions lowering our dependence on one time revenues and combining ongoing revenue initiatives and spending reductions to close a $1.4 billion budget gap.Ã‚Â , 1162517=SECTION 47. Paragraph (B) of section 2 of chapter 18 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out clause (i) and inserting in place thereof the following 2 clauses:- (i) charge a fee up to the maximum amount permissible under federal law for any identification card it issues as a replacement for an identification card that has been lost, mutilated, stolen or destroyed, except if such loss or destruction occurs during the mailing of an original identification card to a recipient, if the card ceases to work through no fault of the recipient or if the department issues replacement cards on its own initiative to classes of recipients; provided that all fees for replacement cards shall be deducted directly from the recipientÃ¢Â€Â™s cash assistance benefits. (j) send a notice to any benefit recipient who requests more than 3 replacement electronic benefit transfer cards in a calendar year and monitor future requests for replacement cards; provided that the notice shall state that the department has noted an unusual number of requests for replacement electronic benefits cards and will be monitoring all future requests for replacement cards., 1229618=SECTION 100. Section 124 of chapter 359 of the acts of 2010 is hereby amended by striking out the words ""and June 30, 2012"", inserted by section 145 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following words:- , June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2013. Extend Leasing Authority for Committee for Public Counsel Services, 1234299=SECTION 107. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, after complying with clause (a) of section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws, the comptroller shall dispose of the consolidated net surplus in the budgetary funds for fiscal year 2012 as follows: (i) transfer $15,000,000 from the General Fund to the Massachusetts Life Sciences Investment Fund established by section 6 of chapter 23I of the General Laws; and (ii) transfer the remaining balance from the General Fund to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund. (b) All transfers pursuant to this section shall be made from the undesignated fund balances in the budgetary funds proportionally from the undesignated fund balances; provided, however, that no such transfer shall cause a deficit in any of the funds., 1207994=SECTION 84. Section 53 of chapter 118E of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following sentence:- To the extent permitted by the demonstration program approved under 42 U.S.C. 1315(a), covered services in the MassHealth Basic and MassHealth Essential programs shall include hospice services to the extent such services are covered in the MassHealth Standard program. Childhood Vaccine Program, 28090=Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Our Communities, 1269855=SECTION 132. If, as a result of the implementation of sections 35, 43, 46 and 75, the appropriation for a state university or the University of Massachusetts is reduced in a fiscal year, after fiscal year 2013, such institution shall have the authority, notwithstanding any limitations in this act, to increase student charges for that fiscal year in order to recover the full amount of the reduction in its appropriation, subject to the approval of the board of higher education. Any such increase shall be in addition to any annual increase in charges authorized under the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s 3-year student charges plan under section 42 of chapter 15A or section 8A of chapter 75 of the General Laws, as applicable., 28709=Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA), Chapter 70 and Special Education Circuit Breaker are the three largest sources of direct state aid to cities, towns and school districts.Ã‚Â  In these three program areas alone, the Senate Ways and Means budget proposes $275.4 million in aid over the amount appropriated in the FY 2012 budget. This budget fully funds anticipated costs of the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s Special Education Circuit Breaker, estimated at $242.2 million.Ã‚Â  This reimbursement program is second to none in its importance to our schools and our communities.Ã‚Â  Each year, our schools ensure that students with special needs are able to receive the education and services they deserve in the setting that best serves them.Ã‚Â  However, in order to meet the growing cost of this obligation to our children, school districts look to the state to provide reimbursements for those special needs students with the highest cost.Ã‚Â  The Senate Ways and Means FY 2013 budget meets this shared obligation Ã¢Â€Â“ an obligation that has not been fully funded since FY 2008. In Chapter 70, too, this budget meets the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s obligations to our schools while also taking steps to address structural inequities in the aid distribution formula.Ã‚Â  The Committee budget provides $145 million in new aid to ensure that each school district receives sufficient aid to meet its Foundation Budget.Ã‚Â  In addition, this budget targets $21 million to communities that receive a smaller share of their foundation budget from the state than should be the case given their property and income wealth.Ã‚Â  This budget marks the first time since FY 2008 that funds have been specifically directed to these Ã¢Â€Âœbelow target aidÃ¢Â€? communities.Ã‚Â  Finally, this budget proposes an additional $13 million in Chapter 70 aid to ensure that all school districts receive at least an additional $40 per pupil in aid over and above FY 2012. Finally, the Committee budget provides $900 million in UGGA to municipalities.Ã‚Â  This funding level builds in both the $834 million appropriated in the FY 2012 GAA as well as the $65 million supplemental local aid payment made through FY 2011 reserves.Ã‚Â  Building this $65 million into the direct appropriation, and not making it contingent on future revenues, provides municipalities with more certainty for their budgeting processes., 1248557=SECTION 119. Notwithstanding clause (xiii) of the third paragraph of section 9A of chapter 211B of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the court administrator may, from the effective date of this act through April 30, 2013, transfer funds from any item of appropriation within the trial court to any other item of appropriation within the trial court; provided, however, that a transfer under said clause (xiii) of said section 9A of said chapter 211B shall not occur until 10 days after the revised funding schedules have been submitted in writing to the house and senate committees on ways and means; and provided further that the revised funding schedules shall include: (1) the amount of money transferred from any item of appropriation to any other item of appropriation; (2) the reason for the necessity of the transfer; and (3) the date on which the transfer shall be completed. Video Teleconferencing, 1301897=SECTION 151. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive office of health and human services shall convene a task force on confidentiality and data sharing, to improve services provided by the commonwealth to children, youth and families and the delivery of those services. The task force shall consist of: the secretary of health and human services, who shall serve as chair; the secretary of education or a designee; the director of Medicaid or a designee; the commissioner of developmental services or a designee; the commissioner of transitional assistance or a designee; the commissioner of children and families or a designee; the commissioner of youth services or a designee; the commissioner of early education and care or a designee; the commissioner of elementary and secondary education or a designee; and 6 persons to be appointed by the governor, 1 of whom shall work in the private sector and have specific expertise in state and federal confidentiality laws and policies, 1 of whom shall have expertise in professional licensure requirements, including codes of conduct and ethics, 1 of whom shall be an information technology expert with experience designing and implementing information technology systems, including electronic medical records, which facilitate improved data collection while also protecting client rights, 1 of whom shall be a researcher who uses data relating to state services provided to children, youth and families and 2 of whom shall be advocates for children, youth and families. The task force shall: (1) review existing laws, regulations and policies regarding confidential communications and informed consent for the purposes of making recommendations for improving personally identifiable data sharing and improving sharing of de-identified aggregate data for the purposes of program evaluation, programmatic and resource planning and development without compromising a clientÃ¢Â€Â™s rights to confidentiality; and (2) develop recommendations for a data set for personally identifiable data sharing that protects client confidentiality and does not exceed the minimum amount necessary to achieve the goals of: (i) identifying individuals receiving benefits or services from more than 1 agency or entity within the executive office of health and human services; (ii) coordinating or managing the programs, benefits or services in human services agencies available to or received by those individuals and evaluating these programs, benefits or services to identify their effects; (iii) creating and maintaining a nonduplicative client identifier system across all agencies and entities within the executive office of health and human services; and (iv) improving the educational opportunities for children receiving services from agencies within the executive office of health and human services. The task force shall report the results of its investigation and study, together with drafts of legislation necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, by filing the same with the clerks of the senate and house of representatives, who shall forward the same to the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities, the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse, the joint committee on public health and the house and senate committees on ways and means on or before January 1, 2013., 1189936=Section 10. (a) The commissioner of revenue shall annually on or before November 15 disburse monies from the fund established in section 9 to a city or town that has accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and notified the commissioner of its acceptance. The community shall notify the commissioner of the date and terms on which the voters accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner the amount the city or town has raised through June 30 by imposing a surcharge on its real property levy and shall certify the percentage of the surcharge applied. In the event a city or town accepts said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3 the municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner by October 30, the maximum additional funds the city or town intends to transfer to the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund from allowable municipal sources for the following fiscal year. Once certified, the city or town may choose to transfer less than the certified amount during the following fiscal year. (b) The commissioner shall multiply the amount remaining in the fund after any disbursements for operating and administrative expenses pursuant to subsection (c) of section 9 by 80 per cent. This amount distributed in the first round distribution shall be known as the match distribution. The first round total shall be distributed to each city or town accepting said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, in an amount not less than 5 per cent but not greater than 100 per cent of the total amount raised by the additional surcharge on real property by each city or town and, if applicable, the additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3. The percentage shall be the same for each city and town and shall be determined by the commissioner annually in a manner that distributes the maximum amount available to each participating city or town. (c) The commissioner shall further divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund in a second round distribution, known as the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine the equity distribution in several steps. The first step shall be to divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund by the number of cities and towns that have accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. This dividend shall be known as the base figure for equity distribution. This base figure shall be determined solely for purposes of performing the calculation for equity distribution and shall not be added to the amount received by a participant. (d) Each city and town in the commonwealth shall be assigned a community preservation rank for purposes of the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine each community's rank by first determining the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s equalized property valuation per capita ranking, ranking cities and towns from highest to lowest valuation. The commissioner shall also determine the population of each city or town and rank each from largest to smallest in population. The commissioner shall add each equalized property valuation rank and population rank, and divide the sum by 2. The dividend shall be the community preservation raw score for that city or town. (e) The commissioner shall then order each city or town by community preservation raw score, from the lowest raw score to the highest raw score. This order shall be the community preservation rank for each city or town. If more than 1 city or town has the same community preservation raw score, the city or town with the higher equalized valuation rank shall receive the higher community preservation rank. (f) After determining the community preservation rank for each city and town, the commissioner shall divide all cities or towns into deciles according to their community preservation ranking, with approximately the same number of cities and towns in each decile, and the cities or towns with the highest community preservation rank shall be placed in the lowest decile category, starting with decile 10. Percentages shall be assigned to each decile as follows: decile 1 140 per cent of the base figure decile 2 130 per cent of the base figure decile 3 120 per cent of the base figure decile 4 110 per cent of the base figure decile 5 100 per cent of the base figure decile 6 90 per cent of the base figure decile 7 80 per cent of the base figure decile 8 70 per cent of the base figure decile 9 60 per cent of the base figure decile 10 50 per cent of the base figure After assigning each city and town to a decile according to their community preservation rank, the commissioner shall multiply the percentage assigned to that decile by the base figure to determine the second round equity distribution for each participant. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the total state contribution for each city and town shall not exceed the actual amount raised by the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s surcharge on its real property levy and, if applicable, additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (b1/2) of section 3. (h) When there are monies remaining in the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund after the first and second round distributions and any necessary administrative expenses have been paid in accordance with section 9, the commissioner may conduct a third round surplus distribution. Any remaining surplus in the fund may be distributed by dividing the amount of the surplus by the number of cities and towns that have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The resulting dividend shall be the surplus base figure. The commissioner shall then use the decile categories and percentages as defined in this section to determine a surplus equity distribution for each participant. (i) The commissioner shall determine each participant's total state grant by adding the amount received in the first round distribution with the amounts received in any later round of distributions, with the exception of a city or town that has already received a grant equal to 100 per cent of the amount the community raised by its surcharge on its real property levy. (1) Only those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge pursuant to subsection (b) of section 3 and those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge and additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources such that the total funds are the equivalent of 3 per cent of the real estate tax levy against real property pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of said section 3 shall be eligible to receive additional state monies through the equity and surplus distributions. (2) If less than 10 per cent of the cities and towns have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and imposed and collected a surcharge on their real property levy, the commissioner may calculate the state grant with only 1 round of distributions or in any other equitable manner. (j) After distributing the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund in accordance with this section, the commissioner shall keep any remaining funds in the trust for distribution in the following year., 1285121=SECTION 143. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the nursing home assessment established in subsection (b) of section 25 of chapter 118G of the General Laws shall be sufficient in the aggregate to generate $220,000,000 in fiscal year 2013., 50029=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Fiscal Discipline, 1105932=Section 74.

Based on the criteria established in this section, the department shall recalculate the minimum required local contribution for a municipality's local and regional schools and shall certify the amounts calculated to the department of elementary and secondary education. (b) A city or town that used qualifying revenue amounts in a fiscal year which are not available for use in the next fiscal year or that shall be required to use revenues for extraordinary non school-related expenses for which it did not have to use revenues in the preceding fiscal year or that has an excessive certified municipal revenue growth factor which is also greater than or equal to 1.5 times the state average municipal revenue growth factor may appeal to the department of revenue not later than October 1, 2012, for an adjustment of its minimum required local contribution and net school spending. (c) If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue may reduce proportionately the minimum required local contribution amount based on the amount of shortfall in revenue or based on the amount of increase in extraordinary expenditures in the current fiscal year, but no adjustment to the minimum required local contribution on account of an extraordinary expense in the budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, shall affect the calculation of the minimum required local contribution in subsequent fiscal years. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of free cash, overlay surplus and other available funds. (d) If upon submission of adequate documentation, the department of revenue determines that a municipality's appeal regarding an excessive municipal revenue growth factor is valid, the department shall recalculate the municipal revenue growth factor and the department of elementary and secondary education shall use the revised growth factor to calculate the preliminary local contribution, the minimum required local contribution and any other factor that directly or indirectly uses the municipal revenue growth factor. Any relief granted as a result of an excessive municipal revenue growth factor shall constitute a permanent reduction in the minimum required local contribution. (e) The board of selectmen in a town, the city council in a city with a plan E form of government, the mayor in any other city or a majority of the member municipalities of a regional school district which used qualifying revenue amounts in a fiscal year that are not available for use in the next fiscal year may appeal to the department of revenue not later than October 1, 2012, for an adjustment to its net school spending requirement. If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue shall reduce the net school spending requirement based on the amount of the shortfall in revenue and reduce the minimum required local contribution of member municipalities accordingly. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of excess and deficiency, surplus and uncommitted reserves. (f) If the regional school budget has already been adopted by two-thirds of the member municipalities then, upon a majority vote of the member municipalities, the regional school committee shall adjust the assessments of the member municipalities in accordance with the reduction in minimum required local contributions approved by the department of revenue or the department of elementary and secondary education in accordance with this section. (g) Notwithstanding clause (14) of section 3 of chapter 214 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the amounts determined pursuant to this section shall be the minimum required local contribution described in chapter 70 of the General Laws. The department of revenue and the department of elementary and secondary education shall notify the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on education of the amount of any reduction in the minimum required local contribution amount. (h) If a city or town has an approved budget that exceeds the recalculated minimum required local contribution and net school spending amounts for its local school system or its recalculated minimum required local contribution to its regional school districts as provided in this section, the local appropriating authority shall determine the extent to which the community shall avail itself of any relief authorized by this section. (i) The amount of financial assistance due from the commonwealth in fiscal year 2013 pursuant to chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other law shall not be changed on account of any redetermination of the minimum required local contribution pursuant to this section. (j) The department of revenue and the department of elementary and secondary education shall issue guidelines to implement their respective duties pursuant to this section., 1175608=SECTION 54.

(b) An individual who obtains, uses, transfers or disposes of food stamp benefits in the manner specified in clause (1) or (2) shall be guilty of food stamp benefits trafficking. An individual traffics food stamp benefits if, with the intent to defraud, the individual: (1) presents for payment or redemption or transfers food stamp benefits in any form, including transfers to another, who does not, or does not intend to, use the food stamp benefits for the benefit of the household for whom the benefits were intended, as defined in the regulations of the department; or (2) possesses, buys, sells, uses, alters, accepts or transfers food stamp benefits in any manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C.

Said chapter 15A is hereby further amended by adding the following 2 sections:- Section 42. (a) The board of trustees of each state university shall, for each academic year, fix and establish student charges for each such state university, subject to the requirements of this section. In-state student charges shall preserve affordability for residents of the commonwealth. Out-of-state student charges shall appropriately balance the financial needs of the college with the need to be competitive with peer institutions regionally. In setting student charges, each state university shall consider factors including, but not limited to, actual appropriations received, the Consumer Price Index, the Higher Education Price Index, tuition and fee rates at peer institutions, collective bargaining costs, funding from the commonwealth measured with reference to the funding formula established in section 15B and making progress towards ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. To the extent practicable, final student charges shall be established for each academic year not later than March 1 of the calendar year in which the rates shall take effect. For the purposes of this section, Ã¢Â€Âœstudent chargesÃ¢Â€? shall include tuition and fees that are charged to students generally for attendance at a state university, but shall not include any fee or other charge established by such state university that is specific to a particular course, program or activity, and shall not include any rates, rents, charges or fees set by the Massachusetts State College Building Authority. (b) Each state university shall submit a 3-year student charges plan to the board of higher education for the boardÃ¢Â€Â™s approval. The plan shall contain the annual student charges that the state university expects to approve for the state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s state-supported programs under subsection (a) for a period of not fewer than 3 academic years. The plan shall also include, but not be limited to, budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of segmental missions and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups. The board of higher education, in considering whether to approve a plan, shall consider, but not be limited to considering, the same factors the campuses are required to consider in setting student charges under this section. For the first 3 years, the board may also consider, to the extent practicable, any steps taken in the plan to ensure that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. For the second 3 years and for each plan submitted thereafter, the board shall consider the progress made toward ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges.

The requirements of section 42 of chapter 15A of the General Laws shall apply to academic years beginning on or after July 1, 2013; provided, however, that in implementing the requirements of subsection (b) of said section 42 of said chapter 15A, the initial 3-year plan shall be submitted to the board of higher education beginning in the academic year beginning on or after July 1, 2013; and provided further that the board of education shall review the plans of each state university for the academic year beginning on or after July 1, 2013. For subsequent academic years, the board shall develop procedures to provide for the review of state university plans on a staggered basis, so that the board may review a smaller number of plans each year. These procedures may include provisions requiring a state university to submit an updated plan before the approval period of such state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s initial plan has expired in order to accommodate a staggered schedule. Notwithstanding any provision of section 42 of chapter 15A of the General Laws to the contrary, the 3-year student charges proposals for the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy shall include provisions for performance measurement standards and admissions standards specific to the respective missions of Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Massachusetts Maritime Academy that are consistent with the performance measurements systems and admission standards in effect on the effective date of this act., 1229260=SECTION 99. Section 195 of chapter 131 of the acts of 2010 is hereby amended by striking out the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ2012Ã¢Â€?, inserted by section 144 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following figure:- 2013. Allow Medical Security Trust Fund Deficit for Fiscal Year 2013, 26080=The Senate Ways and Means Committee does not rely on tax increases to balance its budget.Ã‚Â  As with the GovernorÃ¢Â€Â™s budget recommendations and the recent House budget, the Committee budget assumes ongoing tax revenues of $21.95 billion Ã¢Â€Â“ an increase of $940 million over the projected FY 2012 amount. Ã‚Â This projected revenue increase of 4.47% is indicative of a steady, albeit slow, economic recovery which enables us to avoid many of the painful spending cuts made in recent years. Ã‚Â  All told, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes $32.275 billion in spending; an increase of 3.7% over FY 2012 projected spending.Ã‚Â  The spending increase is the result of non-discretionary increases in labor, utilities and other costs, as well as new targeted investments.Ã‚Â  Even with these increases in spending, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes a number of year-to-year spending reductions necessary to live within our means.Ã‚Â  Of the line items in this budget, 54% have been reduced or level-funded from their FY 2012 GAA level. The most notable spending increases in the Senate Ways and Means budget are in local aid, education and fixed costs, such as debt service, retiree benefits and health care.Ã‚Â  Combined, these spending areas increase $1.1 billion over the FY 2012 level.Ã‚Â  As a result, all other areas of the budget combined increase by less than $50 million.Ã‚Â  As bleak as those spending numbers seem, they stand in sharp contrast to the previous three budgets that saw year-to-year funding in non-discretionary spending slashed. In many ways, the revenue assumptions and spending choices made in this budget anticipate FY 2013 to be one of transition.Ã‚Â  Stronger revenue growth gives us additional resources to avoid spending cuts, while, at the same time, continuing uncertainty requires us to focus not on program expansion, but on beginning to restore the devastation of recent years., 1298916=SECTION 150. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, no grant applications shall be accepted by the executive office of health and human services under item 4000-0005 of section 2 or by the executive office of education for grants distributed under item 7009-6400 of said section 2 in fiscal year 2013 prior to the competitive selection of an independent program evaluator by each administering agency. The independent evaluator chosen for each program shall provide assistance with the evaluation of grant applications and, to the extent possible, in developing the requirements for grant recipients. The independent evaluator shall be responsible for a multi-year evaluation of each programÃ¢Â€Â™s implementation and outcomes; provided that the evaluator shall be responsible for evaluation design. Each program shall select an evaluator based on a competitive process. The selected evaluator shall demonstrate: (i) prior experience in evaluating the impact of social programs on low-income urban youth and communities using either random assignment of treatment or regression discontinuity methods; (ii) prior experience in field evaluation; and (iii) demonstrated skill in using quantitative analysis relevant for program evaluation. When selecting an independent evaluator, the administering agency shall consider: (1) a sample of previous similar work; (2) the ability to perform requested services; and (3) a proposed evaluation budget; provided, however, that the administering agency shall give preference to non-profit research organizations. Each administering agency shall develop a request for proposal for program evaluators based on the criteria included in this section not later than August 15, 2012 and shall select an evaluator not later than October 1, 2012. Once selected, evaluators shall assist the administering agency with reviewing, and to the extent possible, developing requests for proposal for grant funds that ensure that grant recipients: (A) fully cooperate with the independent evaluator; (B) commit to seeking the informed consent of program clients and their families to share data relevant to evaluation; and (C) provide access to program and administrative data necessary for evaluation. The evaluators shall provide quarterly progress updates to the house and senate committees on ways and means that shall inform the committees on the progress of implementing the evaluation plan and shall identify in those updates any obstacles encountered in implementing the evaluation plan; provided, however, that the first quarterly report shall detail the evaluation plan for each program, data required for analysis and outcomes measured. The evaluators shall provide an annual report not later than March 15 of each year of the evaluation period to report on relevant findings and analysis., 37195=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to those in Need, 1305404=SECTION 152. There shall be a special commission to study access to public assistance and state-sponsored services in rural areas. The commission shall consist of 13 members including: the secretary of health and human services or a designee, who shall serve as the chair; the commissioner of transitional assistance or a designee; the child advocate or a designee; the secretary of elder affairs or a designee; the undersecretary of housing and community development or a designee; the commissioner of early education and care or a designee; a representative from the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers; a representative from ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Trust Fund; a representative from the Massachusetts Association of Community Action Centers; a representative from the Massachusetts Model of Community Coalitions; a representative of Mass Home Care; a representative from a food bank or food pantry located in the commonwealth, appointed by the governor; and a representative of the CitizensÃ¢Â€Â™ Housing and Planning Association. The commission shall examine the barriers faced by low- to moderate-income individuals living in rural areas to obtain public assistance and state-sponsored services including, but not limited to, fuel assistance, child care subsidies, direct cash assistance, emergency housing services and health and human service programs which provide services to children, families, persons with disabilities and elders. The commissionÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of traveling to and from regional offices, the cost of delivering services in rural areas and the success of outreach efforts in rural communities. The commission shall investigate the feasibility of coordinating delivery of services between local and state agencies, expanding the use of technology to increase access to services and eliminating application requirements for in-person visits to state agencies. The commission shall file the results of its study, together with drafts of legislation, if any, necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, with the house and senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities and the joint committee on elder affairs not later than April 1, 2013., 50123=The recession of 2008-2011 has forced us as a state to reevaluate our shared priorities and improve our ability to ensure that when the next fiscal crisis comes, we are best positioned to respond to it.Ã‚Â  The Senate, in conjunction with the House and the Governor, has prioritized changing the way we budget to rebuild our reserves, better control spending and improve our fiscal discipline. Ã‚Â  Over the last 2 years, we have implemented new provisions to ensure that volatile revenue sources, such as capital gains revenues over $1 billion and tax settlements, are not built into operating revenues, but instead are deposited directly into the stabilization fund.Ã‚Â  By the end of FY 2013, these two provisions alone will increase stabilization fund deposits by more than $300 million. Ã‚Â  The ability to build our reserves has been complemented by notable successes in controlling health care and other costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, MassHealth costs are expected to grow just under 2% from FY 2011.Ã‚Â  In contrast, between FY 2010 and FY 2011 those same costs grew by 10.2%.Ã‚Â  In addition, the Committee budget, like House 2 and the House budget, rely on greater than anticipated FY 2011 and FY 2012 savings in the Group Insurance Commission and the Health Connector to offset costs in FY 2013.Ã‚Â  Without these recent successes in limiting health care cost growth, many of the investments included in this budget would be impossible. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s FY 2013 budget recommendations reflect an understanding that the work we have done in managing resources and controlling cost growth is only the beginning and must be sustained to continue our recovery.Ã‚Â  To that end, this budget:, 1279786=SECTION 139. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, on or before October 1, 2012 and without further appropriation, the comptroller shall transfer from the General Fund to the Health Safety Net Trust Fund, established in section 36 of chapter 118G of the General Laws, in this section called the fund, the greater of $45,000,000 or one-twelfth of the total expenditures to hospitals and community health centers required pursuant to this act, for the purposes of making initial gross payments to qualifying acute care hospitals for the hospital fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. These payments shall be made to hospitals before, and in anticipation of, the payment by hospitals of their gross liability to the fund. The comptroller shall transfer from the fund to the General Fund on or before June 30, 2013, the amount of the transfer authorized by this section and any allocation of that amount as certified by the director of the health safety net office., 34808=Finally, the Committee budget includes $4 million for the Community Innovation Grant Program which provides grants to municipalities to cover the startup costs of initiatives that will improve service delivery, promote regionalization and reduce costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, 28 municipal projects Ã¢Â€Â“ ranging from the merger of municipal public safety services to the creation of a smart phone app that will help people access municipal services Ã¢Â€Â“ have been funded.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013 this program will not only evaluate and track existing awards, but will support new areas of municipal innovation., 1237596=SECTION 111. The salary adjustments and other cost items authorized by the 2011 amendments to the following collective bargaining agreements, for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014, inclusive, shall be effective for the purposes of section 7 of chapter 150E of the General Laws: (a) between the commonwealth and the Coalition for Public Safety, Unit 5, at the alcoholic beverages control commission; (b) between the commonwealth and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, Unit 9; and (c) between the commonwealth and Lottery - SEIU Local 888 (Unit LT1)., 1247185=SECTION 118. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation may incur liabilities and make expenditures in fiscal year 2013 in excess of funds available to the department for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that such expenditures shall be approved by the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of administration and finance; provided further, that no expenses shall be made in excess of funds available until $50,000,000 has been expended for snow and ice removal in fiscal year 2013; provided further, that the negative balance of funds available for snow and ice removal shall not exceed $30,000,000 at any time; and provided further, that the state comptroller may certify for payment invoices in excess of funds available to the department. (b) The department shall, on or before May 1, 2013, report to the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means the total amounts budgeted and expended for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that the department shall seek appropriations, as required, to cure deficiencies resulting from the removal of snow and ice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013., 1261113=SECTION 125. Notwithstanding section 22N of chapter 7 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the bureau of purchased services within the operational services division shall set prices in fiscal year 2013 for programs under chapter 71B of the General Laws at the same level calculated for fiscal year 2012, except the prices for those programs for extraordinary relief, as defined by the divisionÃ¢Â€Â™s regulations; provided, however, that upon the request of a program, the bureau shall determine the minimum price for out-of-state purchasers by identifying the most recent price calculated for the program and applying the estimated rate of inflation, established by October 1 of each year under said section 22N of said chapter 7, in a compounded manner for each fiscal year following the most recent calculated price. The bureau shall accept and process applications for program reconstruction for fiscal year 2013 to be considered for rate adjustment in fiscal year 2014. Programs for which prices in fiscal year 2012 were lower than the full amount permitted by the operational services division may, in fiscal year 2013, change the full prices calculated for fiscal year 2012., 53286=Twelve months ago, this Committee grappled with closing a $1.9 billion budget gap in the midst of the loss of $1.5 billion in federal stimulus funds and a stabilization fund balance approaching its lowest level in nine years.Ã‚Â  Working with our partners in the House and in the Administration, we closed that gap and more than doubled the stabilization fund balance.Ã‚Â  That work, which resulted in historic highs for the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s bond rating, serves as a template for how this Committee will approach our budget challenges in FY 2013 and beyond., 1009122=SECTION 2E. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The sums set forth in this section are hereby appropriated for transfer from the General Fund to the trust funds named within each item unless specifically designated otherwise in this section, for the purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this section and subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public funds for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Items in this section shall not be subject to allotment under section 9B of chapter 29 of the General Laws or reduction under section 9C of said chapter 29, without express authorization from the general court. Notwithstanding section 19A of said chapter 29, any transfer under this section shall be made by the comptroller in accordance with a transfer schedule to be developed for each item by the comptroller, after consulting with the appropriate agency secretary, the secretary of administration and finance and the state treasurer. The schedule for each appropriation shall provide for transfers in increments considered appropriate to meet the cash flow needs of each fund and all transfers under the schedule shall be completed not later than June 30, 2013. Not later than 7 days after the schedules receive final approval by the comptroller, they shall be reported to the house and senate committees on ways and means, 1282191=SECTION 141. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, there shall be an independent commission to study the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s inpatient and community mental health services. The commission shall consist of 7 members, 1 of whom shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives, who shall serve as co-chair; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the president of the senate, who shall serve as co-chair; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the minority leader of the senate; 1 of whom shall be appointed by the governor; and 2 of whom shall be selected by the co-chairs, of whom 1 shall be selected from a list of 3 nominees provided by the Massachusetts Chapter of the National Alliance of Mental Illness who have demonstrated experience with the commonwealth-funded mental health service delivery system and 1 shall be selected from a list of 3 nominees provided by the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society who have demonstrated experience in evaluation and research of the commonwealth-funded mental health delivery system. The report shall include, but not be limited to: (i) a comprehensive assessment of the inpatient and community-based needs of mental health services funded through the department of mental health, including an estimate of the appropriate number of inpatient beds given the current number of community placements; (ii) the anticipated impact of the closure Taunton State Hospital on the mental health needs of the southeastern region of the commonwealth; and (iii) legislative or other recommendations to maintain and improve the quality of mental health services funded through the department. The department shall provide any information requested by the commission in order to further the purposes of the commission; provided, however, that such information shall not be provided to the commission if the information would violate the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The commission shall submit the results of its study, together with drafts of legislation, if any, necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, by filing the same with the secretary of health and human services, the secretary of administration and finance, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the chairs of the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse not later than December 28, 2012., 1245826=SECTION 115. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, not later than June 30, 2013, the treasurer shall transfer $10,000,000 from the eminent domain trust fund established under section 7D of chapter 79 of the General Laws to the Unclaimed Property Fund established in section 9 of chapter 200A of the General Laws.

Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department of revenue may retain and expend an amount equal to the expenses including, but not limited to, expert witness fees, incurred by the department in pursuing litigation or negotiation of potential 1-time tax settlements or judgments for the commonwealth from the amount received from such 1-time tax settlements or judgments with a net value over $1,000,000; provided, however, that the amount retained in each fiscal year shall not exceed $2,000,000. Beginning in calendar year 2013, the amount retained and expended by the department in the previous fiscal year shall be certified by the secretary of administration and finance and submitted to the house and senate committees on ways and means annually not later than July 15., 1168500=Section 5M. (a) As used in this section, Ã¢Â€ÂœorganizationÃ¢Â€? shall mean a corporation for profit or not-for-profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity; provided, however, that Ã¢Â€ÂœorganizationÃ¢Â€? shall not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (b) An organization that obtains, uses, transfers or disposes of food stamp benefits in the manner specified in subsection (c) shall be guilty of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking.

Ã‚Â§ 2011, as amended, or the regulations of the department, or who presents for payment or redemption food stamp benefits that have been received, transferred, altered or used in violation of this section shall be guilty of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking. (d) If an organization is alleged to have committed the offense of organizational food stamp benefits trafficking 2 or more times within a 6-month period, any of those offenses may be aggregated and charged in a single count and the offenses so aggregated and charged shall constitute a single offense.

Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, the Senate budget made clear that balancing the budget could not come at the expense of maintaining mental health services in the Commonwealth.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013, the Committee budget includes strong provisions to ensure that all regions of the state have adequate access to community and inpatient mental health services by ensuring that 45 state-operated inpatient beds remain in Southeastern Massachusetts as an independent commission examines the appropriate level of state mental health services.Ã‚Â  Maintaining regional coverage, combined with the opening of the new state of the art Worcester State Hospital, will substantially improve both the depth and scope of mental health services in the Commonwealth. In addition to mental health, the Committee budget continues to prioritize ensuring that those with physical disabilities have access to the services they need.Ã‚Â  This budget provides additional funding for Independent Living Centers as well as Turning 22 programs for both blind and developmentally delayed clients.Ã‚Â  While each of these programs serves a distinct population, they share the common theme of providing care and assistance to those of us who face the steepest challenges. The Senate has also been a leader in expanding services for those with substance abuse issues and their families.Ã‚Â  The research is clear: proactively using resources to help people overcome substance abuse problems saves lives and families, and is far less costly than waiting for those same substance abusers to develop other chronic medical conditions or enter the criminal justice system.Ã‚Â  Over the past year, the Senate has provided new resources to the Department of Public Health to develop new treatment programs, changed the process by which substance abusers can be civilly committed to treatment facilities and made it more difficult to illegally obtain prescription narcotics.Ã‚Â  This budget builds on those efforts by providing:, 1219126=SECTION 90. Section 150 of said chapter 149, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ33EÃ¢Â€?, in line 20, the following figure:- , 33F. Criminal Defendant Indigency Verification, 1230682=SECTION 103.

Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the agencies listed in this section may expend the amounts listed in this section for the provision of services to agencies listed in section 2. All expenditures made under this section shall be accompanied by a corresponding transfer of funds from an account listed in section 2 to the Intragovernmental Service Fund, established by section 2Q of chapter 29 of the General Laws. All revenues and other inflows shall be based on rates published by the seller agency that are developed in accordance with cost principles established by the United States Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments. All rates shall be published within 30 days of the enactment of this section. No expenditures shall be made from the Intragovernmental Service Fund which would cause that fund to be in deficit at the close of fiscal year 2013. All authorizations in this section shall be charged to the Intragovernmental Service Fund and shall not be subject to section 5D of chapter 29 of the General Laws. Any balance remaining in that fund at the close of fiscal year 2013 shall be transferred to the General Fund., 1238328=SECTION 112. The salary adjustments and other cost items authorized by the 2011 amendments to the following collective bargaining agreements, for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014, inclusive, shall be effective for the purposes of section 7 of chapter 150E of the General Laws: (a) between the Essex sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers, for Local R1-27 (Unit SE3); (b) between the Barnstable sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, for Local 220 (Unit S5B); (c) between the Barnstable sheriff and the AFL-CIO Council 93, for Local 1462C (Unit S2B); (d) between the Barnstable sheriff and the Barnstable Correctional Officers Union (Unit S1B); (e) between the Barnstable sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers, for Local 217 (Unit S3B); (f) between the Barnstable sheriff and the National Association for Government Employees, for Local 58 (Unit S4B); (g) between the Dukes sheriff and Massachusetts Correctional Officers Federated Union (Unit SD1); (h) between the Suffolk sheriff and the and American Federation of State Council and Municipal Employees, for Council 3967 and 3642, Suffolk Captains (Unit SS6 and SS5); (i) between the Essex sheriff and the Essex correction officers (Unit SE2); (j) between the board of higher education and the Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 93, Local 1067 (Unit 106); (k) between the Berkshire sheriff and the International Brotherhood of Correction Officers/AFL-CIO, Local RI-297 (Unit SB1); (l) between the Berkshire sheriff and the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers - Communications Workers of America (Unit SB2); (m) between the Berkshire sheriffÃ¢Â€Â™s department and the Berkshire County Sheriff's Office Employees Association (Unit SB3); (n) between the Suffolk sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, Local 298 (Unit SS2); (o) between the Middlesex sheriff and the New England Police Benevolent Association/AFL-CIO, Local 500 (Unit SM5); (p) between the Norfolk sheriff and the National Association of Government Employees, RI-202 (Unit SN1); (q) between the Suffolk sheriff and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees/AFL-CIO, Council 93, Local RN (Unit SS3); (r) between the Plymouth county sheriff and the Massachusetts Correctional Officers Federated Union, Emergency Communications Center Unit (Unit SP5); (s) between the University of Massachusetts and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers (Unit D84), for the Dartmouth campus; (t) between the University of Massachusetts and the American Federation of Teachers, Local 1895, AFL-CIO, Educational Services Unit (Unit D85), for the Dartmouth campus; (u) between the University of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Society of Professors/Faculty Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units A50 and B40); (v) between the University of Massachusetts and the University Staff Association/MTA/NEA (Unit A08), for the Amherst campus; (w) between the University of Massachusetts and the Non-Exempt Supervisors Unit, Unit B/MTA/NEA (Unit A15), for the Amherst campus; (x) between the University of Massachusetts and the Professional Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units A52 and B42), for the Amherst and Boston campuses; (y) between the University of Massachusetts and the Classified Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Units B31 and B32), for the Boston campus; (z) between the University of Massachusetts and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 507, AFL-CIO (Unit D82), for the Dartmouth campus; (aa) between the University of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Society of Professors/Lowell/MTA/NEA (Unit L90); (bb) between the University of Massachusetts and the MTA/NEA Clerical/Technical Unit (Unit L92), for the Lowell campus; (cc) between the University of Massachusetts and the MTA/NEA Maintenance/Trades Unit (Unit L93), for the Lowell campus; (dd) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association Associated Professional Administrators (Unit APA); (ee) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association State College Faculty (Unit MSC); (ff) between the board of higher education and the Massachusetts Teachers Association/National Education Association Associated Massachusetts Community Colleges Council (Unit MCC); (gg) between the commonwealth and the registry of deeds (Unit SC1-6); (hh) between the University of Massachusetts and the Amherst Council 93, Local 1776, AFL-CIOs (Unit A01), for the Amherst campus; (ii) between the University of Massachusetts and the Service Employees International Union, Local 888 (Unit L95), for the Lowell campus; and (jj) between the Suffolk sheriff and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for Council 93, Local 419 (Unit SS0). DOR Tax Judgment and Settlement Expenses, 1275196=SECTION 137. (a) Notwithstanding section 53 of chapter 118E of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013, the executive office of health and human services may determine the extent to which to include within its covered services for adults the federally-optional dental services that were included in its state plan or demonstration program in effect on January 1, 2002 and the dental services that were covered for adults in the MassHealth basic program as of January 1, 2002; provided, however, that notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, at least 90 days before restructuring any MassHealth dental benefits, the executive office shall file a report with the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means detailing the proposed changes and the anticipated fiscal impact of such changes. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of section 6 of chapter 118H of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013, medically necessary dental services covered through health insurance plans procured by the board of the commonwealth health insurance connector authority for any resident with a household income that does not exceed 100 per cent of the federal poverty level shall include preventative procedures but shall exclude those categories of services that are not provided through MassHealth., 1220817=Section 40. The fees of the registers of the probate and family court shall be as follows: for the filing of an amended or substituted account, for a petition for the allowance of an account, $75; for the filing of an account, including a common trust fund account, if the gross value accounted for in Schedule A of the account is $1,000 or less, no fee;

Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 the distribution to cities and towns of the balance of the State Lottery Fund, as paid from the General Fund in accordance with clause (c) of the second paragraph of section 35 of chapter 10 of the General Laws, and additional funds from the General Fund shall be $900,000,000 and shall be apportioned to the cities and towns in accordance with this section. Notwithstanding section 2 of chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, except for section 12B of chapter 76 and section 89 of chapter 71 of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city and town from item 7061-0008 of section 2 shall be as set forth in the following lists. The specified amounts to be distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said section 2 shall be in full satisfaction of the amounts due under chapter 70 of the General Laws. For fiscal year 2013, the foundation budget categories for each district shall be calculated in the same manner as in fiscal year 2012. The target local share shall be calculated using the same methodology used in fiscal year 2012. Preliminary local contribution shall be the municipality's fiscal year 2012 minimum required local contribution, increased or decreased by the municipal revenue growth factor; provided, that if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 5 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 1 percentage point; and if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 10 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 2 percentage points. Minimum required local contribution for fiscal year 2013 shall be, for any municipality with a fiscal year 2013 preliminary contribution greater than its fiscal year 2013 target contribution, the preliminary local contribution reduced by 15 per cent of the gap between the preliminary local contribution and the target local contribution. Required local contribution shall be allocated among the districts to which a municipality belongs in direct proportion to the foundation budgets for the municipality's pupils at each of those districts. For fiscal year 2013, ""prior year aid"" shall be fiscal year 2012 state-appropriated chapter 70 aid. Ã‚Â For fiscal year 2013, the ""foundation aid increment"" shall be the difference between: (1) the positive difference between a district's foundation budget and its required district contribution; and (2) prior year aid. For fiscal year 2013, chapter 70 aid shall be: (a) for any district that: (i) has a target aid percentage greater than the sum of a districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid and foundation aid increment as a percentage of foundation budget; and (ii) has a combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation budget of not more than 107.5 per cent; Ã‚Â the sum of prior year aid and 25 per cent of the difference between the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s target aid amount and the sum of prior year aid and the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; (b) for any district with a positive foundation aid increment not included in (a), the sum of the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid plus the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; and (c) for all other districts: the sum of foundation enrollment multiplied by 40 plus prior year aid. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for districts shall be determined by dividing the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield by the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s total foundation budget. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for regional school districts shall be determined by allocating a member municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield among the districts to which said municipality belongs in direct proportion to the foundation budgets for the municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s pupils at each of those districts. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the district's foundation budget. If there is a conflict between the language of this section and the distribution listed below, the distribution below shall control., 1172309=SECTION 52. Chapter 22C of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out section 39, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following 3 sections:-, 21571=In fiscal year 2012, the legislature established an expedited process for cities and towns to realize tens of millions of dollars of savings through municipal health care reform.Ã‚Â  This yearÃ¢Â€Â™s spending plan continues our unfaltering commitment to cities, towns, and school districts by proposing a $275 million increase in local aid over fiscal year 2012.Ã‚Â  An investment in our communities is an investment in programs that improve infrastructure, put people to work, and strengthen our economy. In the face of persistent unemployment and slow job growth, this budget makes an investment in the future of our economy.Ã‚Â  By investing in ways to better connect our public higher education system to our workforce needs, we aim to meet the demands of the growing job sectors., 1260594=SECTION 124. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department of elementary and secondary education shall adopt regulations to certify district costs related to transportation of homeless students under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 11431 et seq. The department shall adopt the regulations required by this section not later than December 1, 2012. Private SPED Tuition Rate Freeze, 1200910=Section 8A. (a) The board of trustees shall fix and establish student charges for the university. In-state tuition and mandatory student charges shall preserve affordability for residents of the commonwealth. Out-of-state student charges shall appropriately balance the financial needs of the university with the need to be competitive with peer institutions regionally. In establishing student charges the board shall consider factors including, but not limited to, actual appropriations received, the Consumer Price Index, the Higher Education Price Index, tuition and fee rates at peer institutions, collective bargaining costs, funding from the commonwealth measured with reference to the funding formula established in section 15B of chapter 15A and making progress toward ensuring that fees constitute no more than 25 per cent of student charges. To the extent practicable, final student charges shall be established for each academic year not later than March 1 of the calendar year in which the rates shall take effect. For the purposes of this section, Ã¢Â€Âœstudent chargesÃ¢Â€? shall mean tuition and fees that are charged to students generally for attendance at the university, but shall not include any fee or other charge established by the university that is specific to a particular course, program or activity, and shall not include any charges for room or board. (b) The university shall submit a 3-year student charges plan to the board of higher education for the boardÃ¢Â€Â™s information consistent with this section. The plan shall contain the annual student charges that the university expects to approve for the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s state-supported programs under the process in subsection (a) for a period of not less than 3 academic years, which shall be the period of the plan. The plan shall also include, but not be limited to, budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of the mission of each university campus and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups. A copy of the plan shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education at the time the plan is submitted to the board of higher education. Notwithstanding the universityÃ¢Â€Â™s obligation to update the plan every 3 years, the university may, from time-to-time, provide a modified plan, under the process provided in subsection (a). If the board of trustees determines that a modification of the 3-year plan is necessary, the trustees shall submit the modified plan to the board of higher education, the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education, with an explanation for the rationale behind any modifications. (c) All student charges received by the board of trustees under this section shall be retained by the university in a revolving trust fund and shall be expended as the board of trustees may direct for the operation and support of the institution. Any balance in a trust fund at the end of a fiscal year shall continue to be held in the trust fund, shall remain available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years and shall not revert to the General Fund. All such trust funds shall be subject to audit by the state auditor., 1251391=SECTION 121. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the amounts transferred pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 22C of chapter 32 of the General Laws shall be made available for the commonwealth's Pension Liability Fund established in section 22 of said chapter 32. The amounts transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section 22C of said chapter 32 shall meet the commonwealth's obligations pursuant to said section 22C of said chapter 32, including retirement benefits payable by the state employees' and the state teachers' retirement systems, for the costs associated with a 3 per cent cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to section 102 of said chapter 32, for the reimbursement of local retirement systems for previously authorized cost-of-living adjustments pursuant to said section 102 of said chapter 32 and for the costs of increased survivor benefits pursuant to chapter 389 of the acts of 1984. The state board of retirement and each city, town, county and district shall verify these costs, subject to the rules adopted by the state treasurer. The state treasurer may make payments upon a transfer of funds to reimburse certain municipalities for pensions to retired teachers, including any other obligations which the commonwealth has assumed on behalf of any retirement system other than the state employees' or state teachers' retirement systems and the commonwealth's share of the amounts to be transferred pursuant to section 22B of said chapter 32 and the amounts to be transferred pursuant to clause (a) of the last paragraph of section 21 of chapter 138 of the General Laws. All payments for the purposes described in this section shall be made only pursuant to distribution of monies from the fund, and any distribution and the payments for which distributions are required shall be detailed in a written report filed quarterly by the secretary of administration and finance with the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on public service in advance of this distribution. Distributions shall not be made in advance of the date on which a payment is actually to be made. The state board of retirement may expend an amount for the purposes of the board of higher education's optional retirement program pursuant to section 40 of chapter 15A of the General Laws. To the extent that the amount transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section 22C of said chapter 32 exceeds the amount necessary to adequately fund the annual pension obligations, the excess amount shall be credited to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund, established by subdivision (8) of section 22 of said chapter 32, for the purpose of reducing the unfunded pension liability of the commonwealth., 24018=The Senate Ways and Means fiscal year 2013 budget reflects the changing landscape of how state government functions within the context of our recent economic past.Ã‚Â  Our budget clearly illustrates two vital lessons that we have learned over the past four difficult years.Ã‚Â  First, this budget emphasizes fiscal sustainability, understanding that the investments we make today are ineffective if we are unable to protect them in the crisis of tomorrow.Ã‚Â  Second, this budget prioritizes investments to help understand how we can use available resources in a way that maximizes programmatic efficiency and positive outcomes. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s budget applies these lessons in the midst of another challenging fiscal environment.Ã‚Â  In spite of these difficult times, the Committee budget attempts to minimize painful program cuts and make a number of new investments in education, housing and workforce development.Ã‚Â  Investments in these three areas have been instrumental in an economic recovery that has outpaced that of other states.Ã‚Â  More importantly, investments in these areas will largely define our ability to prosper in the future. The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget closes a $1.4 billion budget gap with a combination of ongoing revenue initiatives, one-time resources and spending reductions.Ã‚Â  For a second consecutive year, the Committee has been able to close the gap without an overreliance on one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  In fiscal year 2011, the state required $1.8 billion in these one-time solutions to close the budget.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012 and FY 2013 combined, the state will use less than $1 billion in one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  Over that same time period, the state has begun to rebuild its reserves, increasing the balance of the Stabilization Fund from $670 million at the end of FY 2010, to a projected balance of $1.19 billion at the end of FY 2013., 1122559=Section 5B. (a) Any person who: (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; (2) knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; (3) conspires to commit a violation of this subsection; (4) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of section 1128B of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b, or section 41 of chapter 118E; (5) has possession, custody or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof less than all of that property or money; (6) is authorized to make or deliver a document certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, by the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof and, with the intent of defrauding the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, makes or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true; (7) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, who may not lawfully sell or pledge such property; (8) enters into an agreement, contract or understanding with an official of the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof knowing the information contained therein is false; (9) knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or to transmit money or property to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof; or (10) is a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, or is a beneficiary of an overpayment from the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, and who subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim or the receipt of overpayment and fails to disclose the false claim or receipt of overpayment to the commonwealth or a political subdivision by the later of: (i) the date which is 60 days after the date on which the false claim or receipt of overpayment was identified; or (ii) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable, shall be liable to the commonwealth or political subdivision for a civil penalty of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 per violation, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-410 section 5, 104 Stat. 891, note following 28 U.S.C. section 2461, plus 3 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustains because of such violation. A person violating sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also be liable to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof for the expenses of the civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â€Â™ fees, reasonable expert fees and the costs of investigation, as set forth below. Costs recoverable under said sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also include the costs of any review or investigation undertaken by the attorney general, or by the state auditor or the inspector general in cooperation with the attorney general. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if the court finds that: (1) the person committing the violation of subsection (a) furnished an official of the office of the attorney general investigating a false claims law violation with all the information known to such person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the person first obtained the information; (2) such person fully cooperated with any commonwealth investigation of such violation; and (3) at the time such person furnished the commonwealth with the information about the violation, no civil action or administrative action had commenced under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, or no criminal prosecution had commenced with respect to such violation, and such person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation, the court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustained because of the act of that person. (c) A corporation, partnership or other person shall be liable to the commonwealth under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, for the acts of its agent where the agent acted with apparent authority, regardless of whether the agent acted, in whole or in part, to benefit the principal and regardless of whether the principal adopted or ratified the agent's claims, representation, statement or other action or conduct. (d) Sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall not apply to claims, records or statements made or presented to establish, limit, reduce or evade liability for the payment of tax to the commonwealth or other governmental authority. (e) A person who has engaged in conduct described in subsection (a) prior to payment shall only be entitled to payment from the commonwealth of the actual amount due less the excess amount falsely or fraudulently claimed., 1228550=SECTION 97. Section 23 of chapter 5 of the acts of 2009 is hereby amended by striking out the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ2012Ã¢Â€?, inserted by section 137 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following figure:- 2013., 1228306=SECTION 96. Subsection (b) of section 75 of chapter 303 of the acts of 2008 shall not apply in fiscal year 2013., 20737=Fiscal year 2013 will mark the fifth year of unprecedented fiscal challenges. Although our economy has seen modest growth, it is as important now as ever before to continue our fiscal prudence.Ã‚Â  We will once again rise to this challenge with a balanced approach of creative solutions lowering our dependence on one time revenues and combining ongoing revenue initiatives and spending reductions to close a $1.4 billion budget gap.Ã‚Â , 1162517=SECTION 47. Paragraph (B) of section 2 of chapter 18 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by striking out clause (i) and inserting in place thereof the following 2 clauses:- (i) charge a fee up to the maximum amount permissible under federal law for any identification card it issues as a replacement for an identification card that has been lost, mutilated, stolen or destroyed, except if such loss or destruction occurs during the mailing of an original identification card to a recipient, if the card ceases to work through no fault of the recipient or if the department issues replacement cards on its own initiative to classes of recipients; provided that all fees for replacement cards shall be deducted directly from the recipientÃ¢Â€Â™s cash assistance benefits. (j) send a notice to any benefit recipient who requests more than 3 replacement electronic benefit transfer cards in a calendar year and monitor future requests for replacement cards; provided that the notice shall state that the department has noted an unusual number of requests for replacement electronic benefits cards and will be monitoring all future requests for replacement cards., 1229618=SECTION 100. Section 124 of chapter 359 of the acts of 2010 is hereby amended by striking out the words ""and June 30, 2012"", inserted by section 145 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following words:- , June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2013. Extend Leasing Authority for Committee for Public Counsel Services, 1234299=SECTION 107. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, after complying with clause (a) of section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws, the comptroller shall dispose of the consolidated net surplus in the budgetary funds for fiscal year 2012 as follows: (i) transfer $15,000,000 from the General Fund to the Massachusetts Life Sciences Investment Fund established by section 6 of chapter 23I of the General Laws; and (ii) transfer the remaining balance from the General Fund to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund. (b) All transfers pursuant to this section shall be made from the undesignated fund balances in the budgetary funds proportionally from the undesignated fund balances; provided, however, that no such transfer shall cause a deficit in any of the funds., 1207994=SECTION 84. Section 53 of chapter 118E of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following sentence:- To the extent permitted by the demonstration program approved under 42 U.S.C. 1315(a), covered services in the MassHealth Basic and MassHealth Essential programs shall include hospice services to the extent such services are covered in the MassHealth Standard program. Childhood Vaccine Program, 28090=Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Our Communities, 1269855=SECTION 132. If, as a result of the implementation of sections 35, 43, 46 and 75, the appropriation for a state university or the University of Massachusetts is reduced in a fiscal year, after fiscal year 2013, such institution shall have the authority, notwithstanding any limitations in this act, to increase student charges for that fiscal year in order to recover the full amount of the reduction in its appropriation, subject to the approval of the board of higher education. Any such increase shall be in addition to any annual increase in charges authorized under the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s 3-year student charges plan under section 42 of chapter 15A or section 8A of chapter 75 of the General Laws, as applicable., 28709=Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA), Chapter 70 and Special Education Circuit Breaker are the three largest sources of direct state aid to cities, towns and school districts.Ã‚Â  In these three program areas alone, the Senate Ways and Means budget proposes $275.4 million in aid over the amount appropriated in the FY 2012 budget. This budget fully funds anticipated costs of the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s Special Education Circuit Breaker, estimated at $242.2 million.Ã‚Â  This reimbursement program is second to none in its importance to our schools and our communities.Ã‚Â  Each year, our schools ensure that students with special needs are able to receive the education and services they deserve in the setting that best serves them.Ã‚Â  However, in order to meet the growing cost of this obligation to our children, school districts look to the state to provide reimbursements for those special needs students with the highest cost.Ã‚Â  The Senate Ways and Means FY 2013 budget meets this shared obligation Ã¢Â€Â“ an obligation that has not been fully funded since FY 2008. In Chapter 70, too, this budget meets the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s obligations to our schools while also taking steps to address structural inequities in the aid distribution formula.Ã‚Â  The Committee budget provides $145 million in new aid to ensure that each school district receives sufficient aid to meet its Foundation Budget.Ã‚Â  In addition, this budget targets $21 million to communities that receive a smaller share of their foundation budget from the state than should be the case given their property and income wealth.Ã‚Â  This budget marks the first time since FY 2008 that funds have been specifically directed to these Ã¢Â€Âœbelow target aidÃ¢Â€? communities.Ã‚Â  Finally, this budget proposes an additional $13 million in Chapter 70 aid to ensure that all school districts receive at least an additional $40 per pupil in aid over and above FY 2012. Finally, the Committee budget provides $900 million in UGGA to municipalities.Ã‚Â  This funding level builds in both the $834 million appropriated in the FY 2012 GAA as well as the $65 million supplemental local aid payment made through FY 2011 reserves.Ã‚Â  Building this $65 million into the direct appropriation, and not making it contingent on future revenues, provides municipalities with more certainty for their budgeting processes., 1248557=SECTION 119. Notwithstanding clause (xiii) of the third paragraph of section 9A of chapter 211B of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the court administrator may, from the effective date of this act through April 30, 2013, transfer funds from any item of appropriation within the trial court to any other item of appropriation within the trial court; provided, however, that a transfer under said clause (xiii) of said section 9A of said chapter 211B shall not occur until 10 days after the revised funding schedules have been submitted in writing to the house and senate committees on ways and means; and provided further that the revised funding schedules shall include: (1) the amount of money transferred from any item of appropriation to any other item of appropriation; (2) the reason for the necessity of the transfer; and (3) the date on which the transfer shall be completed. Video Teleconferencing, 1301897=SECTION 151. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive office of health and human services shall convene a task force on confidentiality and data sharing, to improve services provided by the commonwealth to children, youth and families and the delivery of those services.

(a) The commissioner of revenue shall annually on or before November 15 disburse monies from the fund established in section 9 to a city or town that has accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and notified the commissioner of its acceptance. The community shall notify the commissioner of the date and terms on which the voters accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner the amount the city or town has raised through June 30 by imposing a surcharge on its real property levy and shall certify the percentage of the surcharge applied. In the event a city or town accepts said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3 the municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner by October 30, the maximum additional funds the city or town intends to transfer to the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund from allowable municipal sources for the following fiscal year. Once certified, the city or town may choose to transfer less than the certified amount during the following fiscal year. (b) The commissioner shall multiply the amount remaining in the fund after any disbursements for operating and administrative expenses pursuant to subsection (c) of section 9 by 80 per cent. This amount distributed in the first round distribution shall be known as the match distribution. The first round total shall be distributed to each city or town accepting said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, in an amount not less than 5 per cent but not greater than 100 per cent of the total amount raised by the additional surcharge on real property by each city or town and, if applicable, the additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3. The percentage shall be the same for each city and town and shall be determined by the commissioner annually in a manner that distributes the maximum amount available to each participating city or town. (c) The commissioner shall further divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund in a second round distribution, known as the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine the equity distribution in several steps. The first step shall be to divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund by the number of cities and towns that have accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. This dividend shall be known as the base figure for equity distribution. This base figure shall be determined solely for purposes of performing the calculation for equity distribution and shall not be added to the amount received by a participant. (d) Each city and town in the commonwealth shall be assigned a community preservation rank for purposes of the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine each community's rank by first determining the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s equalized property valuation per capita ranking, ranking cities and towns from highest to lowest valuation. The commissioner shall also determine the population of each city or town and rank each from largest to smallest in population. The commissioner shall add each equalized property valuation rank and population rank, and divide the sum by 2. The dividend shall be the community preservation raw score for that city or town. (e) The commissioner shall then order each city or town by community preservation raw score, from the lowest raw score to the highest raw score. This order shall be the community preservation rank for each city or town. If more than 1 city or town has the same community preservation raw score, the city or town with the higher equalized valuation rank shall receive the higher community preservation rank. (f) After determining the community preservation rank for each city and town, the commissioner shall divide all cities or towns into deciles according to their community preservation ranking, with approximately the same number of cities and towns in each decile, and the cities or towns with the highest community preservation rank shall be placed in the lowest decile category, starting with decile 10. Percentages shall be assigned to each decile as follows: decile 1 140 per cent of the base figure decile 2 130 per cent of the base figure decile 3 120 per cent of the base figure decile 4 110 per cent of the base figure decile 5 100 per cent of the base figure decile 6 90 per cent of the base figure decile 7 80 per cent of the base figure decile 8 70 per cent of the base figure decile 9 60 per cent of the base figure decile 10 50 per cent of the base figure After assigning each city and town to a decile according to their community preservation rank, the commissioner shall multiply the percentage assigned to that decile by the base figure to determine the second round equity distribution for each participant. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the total state contribution for each city and town shall not exceed the actual amount raised by the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s surcharge on its real property levy and, if applicable, additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (b1/2) of section 3. (h) When there are monies remaining in the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund after the first and second round distributions and any necessary administrative expenses have been paid in accordance with section 9, the commissioner may conduct a third round surplus distribution. Any remaining surplus in the fund may be distributed by dividing the amount of the surplus by the number of cities and towns that have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The resulting dividend shall be the surplus base figure. The commissioner shall then use the decile categories and percentages as defined in this section to determine a surplus equity distribution for each participant. (i) The commissioner shall determine each participant's total state grant by adding the amount received in the first round distribution with the amounts received in any later round of distributions, with the exception of a city or town that has already received a grant equal to 100 per cent of the amount the community raised by its surcharge on its real property levy. (1) Only those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge pursuant to subsection (b) of section 3 and those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge and additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources such that the total funds are the equivalent of 3 per cent of the real estate tax levy against real property pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of said section 3 shall be eligible to receive additional state monies through the equity and surplus distributions. (2) If less than 10 per cent of the cities and towns have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and imposed and collected a surcharge on their real property levy, the commissioner may calculate the state grant with only 1 round of distributions or in any other equitable manner. (j) After distributing the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund in accordance with this section, the commissioner shall keep any remaining funds in the trust for distribution in the following year., 1285121=SECTION 143. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the nursing home assessment established in subsection (b) of section 25 of chapter 118G of the General Laws shall be sufficient in the aggregate to generate $220,000,000 in fiscal year 2013., 50029=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Fiscal Discipline, 1105932=Section 74.

(c) If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue may reduce proportionately the minimum required local contribution amount based on the amount of shortfall in revenue or based on the amount of increase in extraordinary expenditures in the current fiscal year, but no adjustment to the minimum required local contribution on account of an extraordinary expense in the budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, shall affect the calculation of the minimum required local contribution in subsequent fiscal years. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of free cash, overlay surplus and other available funds. (d) If upon submission of adequate documentation, the department of revenue determines that a municipality's appeal regarding an excessive municipal revenue growth factor is valid, the department shall recalculate the municipal revenue growth factor and the department of elementary and secondary education shall use the revised growth factor to calculate the preliminary local contribution, the minimum required local contribution and any other factor that directly or indirectly uses the municipal revenue growth factor. Any relief granted as a result of an excessive municipal revenue growth factor shall constitute a permanent reduction in the minimum required local contribution. (e) The board of selectmen in a town, the city council in a city with a plan E form of government, the mayor in any other city or a majority of the member municipalities of a regional school district which used qualifying revenue amounts in a fiscal year that are not available for use in the next fiscal year may appeal to the department of revenue not later than October 1, 2012, for an adjustment to its net school spending requirement. If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue shall reduce the net school spending requirement based on the amount of the shortfall in revenue and reduce the minimum required local contribution of member municipalities accordingly. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of excess and deficiency, surplus and uncommitted reserves. (f) If the regional school budget has already been adopted by two-thirds of the member municipalities then, upon a majority vote of the member municipalities, the regional school committee shall adjust the assessments of the member municipalities in accordance with the reduction in minimum required local contributions approved by the department of revenue or the department of elementary and secondary education in accordance with this section. (g) Notwithstanding clause (14) of section 3 of chapter 214 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the amounts determined pursuant to this section shall be the minimum required local contribution described in chapter 70 of the General Laws. The department of revenue and the department of elementary and secondary education shall notify the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on education of the amount of any reduction in the minimum required local contribution amount. (h) If a city or town has an approved budget that exceeds the recalculated minimum required local contribution and net school spending amounts for its local school system or its recalculated minimum required local contribution to its regional school districts as provided in this section, the local appropriating authority shall determine the extent to which the community shall avail itself of any relief authorized by this section. (i) The amount of financial assistance due from the commonwealth in fiscal year 2013 pursuant to chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other law shall not be changed on account of any redetermination of the minimum required local contribution pursuant to this section.

(b) An individual who obtains, uses, transfers or disposes of food stamp benefits in the manner specified in clause (1) or (2) shall be guilty of food stamp benefits trafficking. An individual traffics food stamp benefits if, with the intent to defraud, the individual: (1) presents for payment or redemption or transfers food stamp benefits in any form, including transfers to another, who does not, or does not intend to, use the food stamp benefits for the benefit of the household for whom the benefits were intended, as defined in the regulations of the department; or (2) possesses, buys, sells, uses, alters, accepts or transfers food stamp benefits in any manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C.

(c) An individual who traffics food stamp benefits, as described in subsection (b), shall: (1) if the food stamp benefits are of a value of less than $250 or if the item used, transferred, acquired, altered or possessed has a value of less than $250, be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than 1 year or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both such fine and imprisonment; or (2) if the food stamp benefits are of a value of $250 or more or the item used, transferred, acquired, altered or possessed has a value of $250 or more, be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than 2 years or by imprisonment in a state prison for not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or both fine and imprisonment. (d) If a person is alleged to have committed the offense of trafficking in food stamp benefits 2 or more times within a 6-month period, those offenses may be aggregated and charged in a single count and the offenses so aggregated and charged shall constitute a single offense; provided, however, that, if the aggregate value of the food stamp benefits alleged to be trafficked is $250 or more, the person shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in clause (2) of subsection (c)., 1231972=SECTION 105. The transfer of funds into the State Retiree Benefits Trust Fund required by section 152 of chapter 68 of the acts of 2011 shall not occur in fiscal year 2013., 1153932=SECTION 46. Said chapter 15A is hereby further amended by adding the following 2 sections:- Section 42. (a) The board of trustees of each state university shall, for each academic year, fix and establish student charges for each such state university, subject to the requirements of this section. In-state student charges shall preserve affordability for residents of the commonwealth. Out-of-state student charges shall appropriately balance the financial needs of the college with the need to be competitive with peer institutions regionally. In setting student charges, each state university shall consider factors including, but not limited to, actual appropriations received, the Consumer Price Index, the Higher Education Price Index, tuition and fee rates at peer institutions, collective bargaining costs, funding from the commonwealth measured with reference to the funding formula established in section 15B and making progress towards ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. To the extent practicable, final student charges shall be established for each academic year not later than March 1 of the calendar year in which the rates shall take effect. For the purposes of this section, Ã¢Â€Âœstudent chargesÃ¢Â€? shall include tuition and fees that are charged to students generally for attendance at a state university, but shall not include any fee or other charge established by such state university that is specific to a particular course, program or activity, and shall not include any rates, rents, charges or fees set by the Massachusetts State College Building Authority. (b) Each state university shall submit a 3-year student charges plan to the board of higher education for the boardÃ¢Â€Â™s approval. The plan shall contain the annual student charges that the state university expects to approve for the state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s state-supported programs under subsection (a) for a period of not fewer than 3 academic years. The plan shall also include, but not be limited to, budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of segmental missions and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups. The board of higher education, in considering whether to approve a plan, shall consider, but not be limited to considering, the same factors the campuses are required to consider in setting student charges under this section. For the first 3 years, the board may also consider, to the extent practicable, any steps taken in the plan to ensure that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. For the second 3 years and for each plan submitted thereafter, the board shall consider the progress made toward ensuring that fees constitute not more than 25 per cent of student charges. Within 120 days after submission of a plan, the board of higher education shall either approve the plan or return it to the state university with suggested changes. The approval shall require a 2/3 vote of the board of higher education. If the board of higher education does not vote on a plan within 120 days after its submission, the plan shall be considered approved. A copy of the plan shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education at the time the plan is submitted to the board of higher education. (c) If following the approval of a state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s plan under subsection (b) the board of trustees of such state university approves, for any academic year, student charges that are greater than 105 per cent of the student charges approved in such universityÃ¢Â€Â™s plan, the state university shall submit such greater rate to the board of higher education for its approval as part of an amended student charges plan. The amended plan shall describe in detail the reasons why the state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s student charges are greater than the expected student charges and shall provide revised or updated information on budget and enrollment projections for each year, projections for in-state and out-of-state enrollments for each year, consideration of segmental missions and plans to ensure continuing access to the institution by residents of the commonwealth and to maintain and increase access for underrepresented student groups, as necessary. Within 60 days after the submission of a revised plan, the board of higher education shall either approve the plan or return it to the state university with suggested changes. The approval shall require a 2/3 vote of the board of higher education. If the board of higher education does not vote on a plan within 60 days after its submission, the plan shall be considered approved. A copy of the revised plan shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education at the time the plan is submitted to the board of higher education. (d) A state university or the board of higher education may, at its discretion, request that a plan approved under subsection (b) or (c) be re-examined and modified in accordance with procedures established by the board of higher education. Any resulting modification shall be concurred with by the board of trustees of the affected state university and by a 2/3 vote of the board of higher education. (e) All student charges received by the board of trustees of a state university under this section shall be retained by the board of trustees of that institution in a revolving trust fund and shall be expended as the board of trustees may direct for the operation and support of the institution. Any balance in a trust fund at the end of a fiscal year shall continue to be held in the trust fund, shall remain available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years and shall not revert to the General Fund. All such trust funds shall be subject to audit by the state auditor. Section 43. The commissioner shall establish in the department of higher education, an office of coordination. The commissioner shall appoint a director to operate and administer the office who shall have experience with workforce development in the public or private sector. The director shall work to establish a clearinghouse for all training opportunities provided by public higher educational institutions. The University of Massachusetts, state universities and community colleges shall report to this office every workforce training opportunity they provide and all workforce training requests they received but were not able to meet. The director shall maintain a public website listing all such training opportunities offered and shall provide support for employers with workforce training needs. The director shall provide information to public institutions of higher education to help the institutions provide workforce development services in the most efficient manner possible and eliminate redundancies in the commonwealthÃ¢Â€Â™s workforce development offerings. The director shall establish a program for employers newly opened in or relocated to the commonwealth to apprise these employers of workforce training programs and provide assistance in securing workforce development grants. The director shall prepare an annual report for publication on progress to improve the effectiveness of the commonwealthÃ¢Â€Â™s workforce development efforts and shall report regularly to the public on the progress the office is making towards achieving the stated goals. The annual report, which shall be in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, shall include, but not be limited to: (i) a commissioner-approved plan for the year, including the goals set for the year and the performance measurements by which to evaluate those goals and programs or initiatives to meet those goals; (ii) the number, nature and amount of trainings facilitated and grants awarded to employers assisted by the office; and (iii) a description of technical assistance that the office provided. The annual report of the office shall be made available to the public on the commonwealthÃ¢Â€Â™s website not later than December 31 and shall be filed with the clerks of the senate and house of representatives and the chairs of the house and senate committees on ways and means., 1232251=SECTION 106. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the comptroller shall, on or before June 30, 2013, transfer $290,000,000 to the General Fund from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund; provided, however, the comptroller shall instead transfer a lesser amount if the secretary of administration and finance so requests in writing. The comptroller, in consultation with the secretary of administration and finance, may take the overall cash flow needs of the commonwealth into consideration in determining the timing of any transfer of funds. The comptroller shall provide a schedule of transfers to the secretary of administration and finance and to the house and senate committees on ways and means. (b) Notwithstanding clause (a) of section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, during fiscal year 2013 the comptroller shall not transfer 0.5 per cent of the total revenue from taxes in the preceding fiscal year to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund, as required by said clause (a). However, upon written certification by the secretary of administration and finance that there are sufficient funds to make some or all of the transfer required under said clause (a), the comptroller shall so transfer the amount certified. The comptroller, in consultation with the secretary of administration and finance, may take the overall cash flow needs of the commonwealth into consideration in determining the timing of any transfer of funds under this subsection. The comptroller shall provide a schedule of transfers to the secretary of administration and finance and to the house and senate committees on ways and means. (c) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the comptroller shall, on or before June 30, 2013, transfer the interest earned from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund during fiscal year 2013 to the General Fund., 1235216=SECTION 108. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon receiving a written request from the secretary of administration and finance, the comptroller shall transfer to the General Fund the unexpended balance of a fund, trust fund or other separate account, in existence on April 1, 2012, whether established administratively or by law, including a separate account established under section 6 of chapter 6A of the General Laws or section 4F of chapter 7 of the General Laws. The request shall certify that the secretary, in consultation with the comptroller, has determined this balance not to be necessary for the purposes for which it was made available. The secretary and comptroller shall report to the house and senate committees on ways and means 45 days prior to any such transfer; provided, however, that the comptroller may submit to the house and senate committees on ways and means not later than October 1, 2012 an alternative plan to further maximize revenue generation from additional trust fund balance transfers to the General Fund., 1262472=SECTION 126. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, for any state university or the University of Massachusetts the dollar value of tuition and fee waivers authorized by statute by the board of higher education, by the board of trustees of the University of Massachusetts, by the boards of trustees of individual state universities and by the campuses of the University of Massachusetts shall remain at the level set in academic year 2012-2013; provided, however, that if sufficient funds are appropriated to allow for the dollar value of a particular waiver to be increased, the dollar value of such waiver shall be increased commensurately. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the alteration, amendment or abrogation of any tuition remission policy or tuition or fee waiver program negotiated under chapter 150E of the General Laws and contained in any collective bargaining agreement or approved for non-unit personnel by the board of higher education or the institutional boards of trustees or their designees. This section shall not apply to students who are currently or were formerly in the custody of the department of children and families and are eligible to receive a tuition and fee waiver under section 19 of chapter 15A of the General Laws or to students who are eligible to receive a Massachusetts National Guard tuition and fee waiver under said section 19 of said chapter 15A., 69071=SECTION 1A. In accordance with Articles LXIII and CVII of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the Commonwealth and section 6D of chapter 29 of the General Laws, it is hereby declared that the amounts of revenue set forth in this section by source for the respective funds of the commonwealth for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 are necessary and sufficient to provide the means to defray the appropriations and expenditures from such funds for said fiscal year as set forth and authorized in sections 2, 2B and 2E. The comptroller shall keep a distinct account of actual receipts from each such source by each such fund to furnish the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means with quarterly statements comparing such receipts with the projected receipts set forth herein and to include a full statement comparing such actual and projected receipts in the annual report for said fiscal year pursuant to section 12 of chapter 7A of the General Laws. The quarterly and annual reports shall also include detailed statements of any other sources of revenue for the budgeted funds in addition to those specified in this section., 1308336=SECTION 154. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, subject to appropriation, the Cape Cod Commission, or its designee, shall link existing land use data with newly developed scientific and financial planning data to create a comprehensive, linked model for the purpose of identifying environmentally appropriate and affordable wastewater infrastructure solutions. The model shall identify the appropriate economy of scale for wastewater infrastructure solutions and shall provide estimates of the costs associated with implementing various solutions. The model may be used by communities in the commonwealth to pursue regional wastewater options that satisfy environmental regulatory requirements in the most efficient and cost effective manner and have the potential to preempt future water quality litigation. The comprehensive model shall be accessible to the public through a web mapping application. The components of the model and the web mapping application shall include, but not be limited to: (i) Cape-wide build-out scenarios and water usage data; (ii) recommendations regarding the appropriate use and costs of a range of technologies in specific circumstances for achieving water quality goals, including natural systems restoration, alternative on-site technologies and more traditional technologies such as satellite, cluster and centralized treatment technologies; (iii) scientific data that supports the calculation of nitrogen loads and estimates the impact of various land use patterns, technologies and other factors on water quality; and (iv) planning level cost estimates of wastewater infrastructure costs to Cape Cod taxpayers and potential rate payers to meet water quality goals. The model shall allow the user to vary land use development patterns, wastewater infrastructure technologies and tax and rate structures to understand the environmental and financial implications of various decisions related to wastewater planning. The comprehensive model shall be completed not later than June 30, 2013., 1100033=SECTION 4.

The commissioner of health care finance and policy shall determine the final amount required to be included in the Vaccine Purchase Trust Fund for the next fiscal year to cover the estimated vaccine cost pursuant to this chapter and shall annually provide surcharge payors notice of the assessment amount for the trust fund year not later than January 1. Under regulations adopted by the commissioner of health care finance and policy, each surcharge payor in the commonwealth shall pay to the commissioner of health care finance and policy, for deposit in the Vaccine Purchase Trust Fund, a routine childhood immunizations surcharge assessed by the commissioner; provided, however, that the amount of the routine childhood immunizations surcharge assessed to cover the costs for storing and distributing such vaccines, if such costs are not covered by federal contribution, and for the costs of administering the Massachusetts immunization registry, shall not exceed 10 per cent of the amount of the routine childhood immunizations surcharge assessed to cover the purchase of vaccines needed for routine childhood immunizations for all children in the commonwealth. The regulations shall establish dates for assessing and payment of such surcharge and shall permit and enable expenditure of funds by the department of public health. The annual contribution into the trust fund shall be deposited annually by July 1. Such surcharge shall be a percentage of the final amount determined by the commissioner of health care finance and policy pursuant to this section., 1265180=SECTION 129.

The report shall examine the extent to which these waivers are being used by the intended beneficiaries, the cost to the state universities, the University of Massachusetts and the commonwealth of these waivers, and the relative benefits of maintaining these waivers as compared to providing additional support to students through the scholarship programs authorized in section 16 of chapter 15A of the General Laws. The report shall include recommendations to the board concerning the extent to which such waiver programs should be continued, modified, discontinued or replaced by providing additional support to the state scholarship program and further recommendations to enable campuses to alter the proportion of student charges that are represented by tuition and fees so that fees represent no more than 25 per cent of total student charges. The report shall also include any recommendations for pertinent regulatory or statutory changes. A copy of the report shall be provided to the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means, the board of trustees of the University of Massachusetts and the secretary of education at the time the report is submitted to the board of higher education., 1267090=SECTION 130.

Section 8A of chapter 75 of the General laws shall apply to academic years beginning on or after July 1, 2013; provided, however, that in implementing the requirements of subsection (b) of said section 8A of said chapter 75, the initial 3-year plan shall be submitted to the board of higher education beginning in the academic year beginning on or after July 1, 2013., 1246271=SECTION 116. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the formula for application of funds provided in section 35J of chapter 10 of the General Laws shall not apply in fiscal year 2013., 1205757=SECTION 78. Section 20 of chapter 90 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph:- There shall be a surcharge of $5 on a fine assessed against a person convicted of or found responsible for a motor vehicle violation under this chapter or under a special regulation made under the authority of this chapter. The surcharge shall be transferred by the registrar to the state treasurer for deposit into the Public Safety Training Fund established in section 2FFFF of chapter 29., 1109360=SECTION 13. Said chapter 8 is hereby further amended by striking out section 9, as amended by section 20 of chapter 68 of the acts of 2011, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-, 1237139=SECTION 110. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, when the comptroller disposes of the consolidated net surplus for fiscal year 2013 under subsection (a) of section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws, the comptroller shall not carry forward 0.5 per cent of the total revenue from taxes in fiscal year 2013., 1276680=SECTION 138. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive office of health and human services, acting in its capacity as the single state agency under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and as the principal agency for all of the agencies within the executive office and other federally-assisted programs administered by the executive office, may enter into interdepartmental services agreements with the University of Massachusetts medical school to perform activities that the secretary of health and human services, in consultation with the comptroller, determines appropriate and within the scope of the proper administration of said Title XIX and other federal funding provisions to support the programs and activities of the executive office. The activities may include: (1) providing administrative services including, but not limited to, providing the medical expertise to support or administer utilization management activities, determining eligibility based on disability, supporting case management activities and similar initiatives; (2) providing consulting services related to quality assurance, program evaluation and development, integrity and soundness and project management; and (3) providing activities and services for the purpose of pursuing federal reimbursement or avoiding costs, third-party liability and recouping payments to third parties. Federal reimbursement for any expenditures made by the University of Massachusetts medical school relative to federally-reimbursable services the university provides under these interdepartmental service agreements or other contracts with the executive office shall be distributed to the university and recorded distinctly in the state accounting system. The secretary may negotiate contingency fees for activities and services related to pursuing federal reimbursement or avoiding costs and the comptroller shall certify these fees and pay them upon the receipt of this revenue, reimbursement or demonstration of costs avoided. Contracts for contingency fees shall not exceed 3 years and shall not be renewed without prior review and approval by the executive office for administration and finance. The secretary shall not pay contingency fees in excess of $40,000,000 for state fiscal year 2013; provided, however, that contingency fees paid to the University of Massachusetts medical school under an interagency service agreement for recoveries related to the special disability workload projects shall be excluded from that $40,000,000 limit for fiscal year 2013. The secretary of health and human services shall submit to the secretary of administration and finance and the senate and house committees on ways and means a quarterly report detailing the amounts of the agreements, the ongoing and new projects undertaken by the university, the amounts expended on personnel and the amount of federal reimbursement and recoupment payments that the university collected., 1311257=SECTION 156.

For subsequent academic years, the board shall develop procedures to provide for the review of state university plans on a staggered basis, so that the board may review a smaller number of plans each year. These procedures may include provisions requiring a state university to submit an updated plan before the approval period of such state universityÃ¢Â€Â™s initial plan has expired in order to accommodate a staggered schedule. Notwithstanding any provision of section 42 of chapter 15A of the General Laws to the contrary, the 3-year student charges proposals for the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy shall include provisions for performance measurement standards and admissions standards specific to the respective missions of Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Massachusetts Maritime Academy that are consistent with the performance measurements systems and admission standards in effect on the effective date of this act., 1229260=SECTION 99. Section 195 of chapter 131 of the acts of 2010 is hereby amended by striking out the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ2012Ã¢Â€?, inserted by section 144 of said chapter 68, and inserting in place thereof the following figure:- 2013. Allow Medical Security Trust Fund Deficit for Fiscal Year 2013, 26080=The Senate Ways and Means Committee does not rely on tax increases to balance its budget.Ã‚Â  As with the GovernorÃ¢Â€Â™s budget recommendations and the recent House budget, the Committee budget assumes ongoing tax revenues of $21.95 billion Ã¢Â€Â“ an increase of $940 million over the projected FY 2012 amount. Ã‚Â This projected revenue increase of 4.47% is indicative of a steady, albeit slow, economic recovery which enables us to avoid many of the painful spending cuts made in recent years. Ã‚Â  All told, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes $32.275 billion in spending; an increase of 3.7% over FY 2012 projected spending.Ã‚Â  The spending increase is the result of non-discretionary increases in labor, utilities and other costs, as well as new targeted investments.Ã‚Â  Even with these increases in spending, the Senate Ways and Means budget includes a number of year-to-year spending reductions necessary to live within our means.Ã‚Â  Of the line items in this budget, 54% have been reduced or level-funded from their FY 2012 GAA level. The most notable spending increases in the Senate Ways and Means budget are in local aid, education and fixed costs, such as debt service, retiree benefits and health care.Ã‚Â  Combined, these spending areas increase $1.1 billion over the FY 2012 level.Ã‚Â  As a result, all other areas of the budget combined increase by less than $50 million.Ã‚Â  As bleak as those spending numbers seem, they stand in sharp contrast to the previous three budgets that saw year-to-year funding in non-discretionary spending slashed. In many ways, the revenue assumptions and spending choices made in this budget anticipate FY 2013 to be one of transition.Ã‚Â  Stronger revenue growth gives us additional resources to avoid spending cuts, while, at the same time, continuing uncertainty requires us to focus not on program expansion, but on beginning to restore the devastation of recent years., 1298916=SECTION 150. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, no grant applications shall be accepted by the executive office of health and human services under item 4000-0005 of section 2 or by the executive office of education for grants distributed under item 7009-6400 of said section 2 in fiscal year 2013 prior to the competitive selection of an independent program evaluator by each administering agency. The independent evaluator chosen for each program shall provide assistance with the evaluation of grant applications and, to the extent possible, in developing the requirements for grant recipients. The independent evaluator shall be responsible for a multi-year evaluation of each programÃ¢Â€Â™s implementation and outcomes; provided that the evaluator shall be responsible for evaluation design. Each program shall select an evaluator based on a competitive process. The selected evaluator shall demonstrate: (i) prior experience in evaluating the impact of social programs on low-income urban youth and communities using either random assignment of treatment or regression discontinuity methods; (ii) prior experience in field evaluation; and (iii) demonstrated skill in using quantitative analysis relevant for program evaluation. When selecting an independent evaluator, the administering agency shall consider: (1) a sample of previous similar work; (2) the ability to perform requested services; and (3) a proposed evaluation budget; provided, however, that the administering agency shall give preference to non-profit research organizations. Each administering agency shall develop a request for proposal for program evaluators based on the criteria included in this section not later than August 15, 2012 and shall select an evaluator not later than October 1, 2012. Once selected, evaluators shall assist the administering agency with reviewing, and to the extent possible, developing requests for proposal for grant funds that ensure that grant recipients: (A) fully cooperate with the independent evaluator; (B) commit to seeking the informed consent of program clients and their families to share data relevant to evaluation; and (C) provide access to program and administrative data necessary for evaluation. The evaluators shall provide quarterly progress updates to the house and senate committees on ways and means that shall inform the committees on the progress of implementing the evaluation plan and shall identify in those updates any obstacles encountered in implementing the evaluation plan; provided, however, that the first quarterly report shall detail the evaluation plan for each program, data required for analysis and outcomes measured. The evaluators shall provide an annual report not later than March 15 of each year of the evaluation period to report on relevant findings and analysis., 37195=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to those in Need, 1305404=SECTION 152. There shall be a special commission to study access to public assistance and state-sponsored services in rural areas. The commission shall consist of 13 members including: the secretary of health and human services or a designee, who shall serve as the chair; the commissioner of transitional assistance or a designee; the child advocate or a designee; the secretary of elder affairs or a designee; the undersecretary of housing and community development or a designee; the commissioner of early education and care or a designee; a representative from the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers; a representative from ChildrenÃ¢Â€Â™s Trust Fund; a representative from the Massachusetts Association of Community Action Centers; a representative from the Massachusetts Model of Community Coalitions; a representative of Mass Home Care; a representative from a food bank or food pantry located in the commonwealth, appointed by the governor; and a representative of the CitizensÃ¢Â€Â™ Housing and Planning Association. The commission shall examine the barriers faced by low- to moderate-income individuals living in rural areas to obtain public assistance and state-sponsored services including, but not limited to, fuel assistance, child care subsidies, direct cash assistance, emergency housing services and health and human service programs which provide services to children, families, persons with disabilities and elders. The commissionÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of traveling to and from regional offices, the cost of delivering services in rural areas and the success of outreach efforts in rural communities. The commission shall investigate the feasibility of coordinating delivery of services between local and state agencies, expanding the use of technology to increase access to services and eliminating application requirements for in-person visits to state agencies. The commission shall file the results of its study, together with drafts of legislation, if any, necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, with the house and senate committees on ways and means, the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities and the joint committee on elder affairs not later than April 1, 2013., 50123=The recession of 2008-2011 has forced us as a state to reevaluate our shared priorities and improve our ability to ensure that when the next fiscal crisis comes, we are best positioned to respond to it.Ã‚Â  The Senate, in conjunction with the House and the Governor, has prioritized changing the way we budget to rebuild our reserves, better control spending and improve our fiscal discipline. Ã‚Â  Over the last 2 years, we have implemented new provisions to ensure that volatile revenue sources, such as capital gains revenues over $1 billion and tax settlements, are not built into operating revenues, but instead are deposited directly into the stabilization fund.Ã‚Â  By the end of FY 2013, these two provisions alone will increase stabilization fund deposits by more than $300 million. Ã‚Â  The ability to build our reserves has been complemented by notable successes in controlling health care and other costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, MassHealth costs are expected to grow just under 2% from FY 2011.Ã‚Â  In contrast, between FY 2010 and FY 2011 those same costs grew by 10.2%.Ã‚Â  In addition, the Committee budget, like House 2 and the House budget, rely on greater than anticipated FY 2011 and FY 2012 savings in the Group Insurance Commission and the Health Connector to offset costs in FY 2013.Ã‚Â  Without these recent successes in limiting health care cost growth, many of the investments included in this budget would be impossible. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s FY 2013 budget recommendations reflect an understanding that the work we have done in managing resources and controlling cost growth is only the beginning and must be sustained to continue our recovery.Ã‚Â  To that end, this budget:, 1279786=SECTION 139. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, on or before October 1, 2012 and without further appropriation, the comptroller shall transfer from the General Fund to the Health Safety Net Trust Fund, established in section 36 of chapter 118G of the General Laws, in this section called the fund, the greater of $45,000,000 or one-twelfth of the total expenditures to hospitals and community health centers required pursuant to this act, for the purposes of making initial gross payments to qualifying acute care hospitals for the hospital fiscal year beginning October 1, 2012. These payments shall be made to hospitals before, and in anticipation of, the payment by hospitals of their gross liability to the fund. The comptroller shall transfer from the fund to the General Fund on or before June 30, 2013, the amount of the transfer authorized by this section and any allocation of that amount as certified by the director of the health safety net office., 34808=Finally, the Committee budget includes $4 million for the Community Innovation Grant Program which provides grants to municipalities to cover the startup costs of initiatives that will improve service delivery, promote regionalization and reduce costs.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, 28 municipal projects Ã¢Â€Â“ ranging from the merger of municipal public safety services to the creation of a smart phone app that will help people access municipal services Ã¢Â€Â“ have been funded.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013 this program will not only evaluate and track existing awards, but will support new areas of municipal innovation., 1237596=SECTION 111. The salary adjustments and other cost items authorized by the 2011 amendments to the following collective bargaining agreements, for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014, inclusive, shall be effective for the purposes of section 7 of chapter 150E of the General Laws: (a) between the commonwealth and the Coalition for Public Safety, Unit 5, at the alcoholic beverages control commission; (b) between the commonwealth and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, Unit 9; and (c) between the commonwealth and Lottery - SEIU Local 888 (Unit LT1)., 1247185=SECTION 118. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation may incur liabilities and make expenditures in fiscal year 2013 in excess of funds available to the department for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that such expenditures shall be approved by the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of administration and finance; provided further, that no expenses shall be made in excess of funds available until $50,000,000 has been expended for snow and ice removal in fiscal year 2013; provided further, that the negative balance of funds available for snow and ice removal shall not exceed $30,000,000 at any time; and provided further, that the state comptroller may certify for payment invoices in excess of funds available to the department. (b) The department shall, on or before May 1, 2013, report to the executive office for administration and finance and the house and senate committees on ways and means the total amounts budgeted and expended for snow and ice removal; provided, however, that the department shall seek appropriations, as required, to cure deficiencies resulting from the removal of snow and ice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013., 1261113=SECTION 125. Notwithstanding section 22N of chapter 7 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the bureau of purchased services within the operational services division shall set prices in fiscal year 2013 for programs under chapter 71B of the General Laws at the same level calculated for fiscal year 2012, except the prices for those programs for extraordinary relief, as defined by the divisionÃ¢Â€Â™s regulations; provided, however, that upon the request of a program, the bureau shall determine the minimum price for out-of-state purchasers by identifying the most recent price calculated for the program and applying the estimated rate of inflation, established by October 1 of each year under said section 22N of said chapter 7, in a compounded manner for each fiscal year following the most recent calculated price. The bureau shall accept and process applications for program reconstruction for fiscal year 2013 to be considered for rate adjustment in fiscal year 2014. Programs for which prices in fiscal year 2012 were lower than the full amount permitted by the operational services division may, in fiscal year 2013, change the full prices calculated for fiscal year 2012., 53286=Twelve months ago, this Committee grappled with closing a $1.9 billion budget gap in the midst of the loss of $1.5 billion in federal stimulus funds and a stabilization fund balance approaching its lowest level in nine years.Ã‚Â  Working with our partners in the House and in the Administration, we closed that gap and more than doubled the stabilization fund balance.Ã‚Â  That work, which resulted in historic highs for the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s bond rating, serves as a template for how this Committee will approach our budget challenges in FY 2013 and beyond., 1009122=SECTION 2E. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The sums set forth in this section are hereby appropriated for transfer from the General Fund to the trust funds named within each item unless specifically designated otherwise in this section, for the purposes and subject to the conditions specified in this section and subject to the laws regulating the disbursement of public funds for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Items in this section shall not be subject to allotment under section 9B of chapter 29 of the General Laws or reduction under section 9C of said chapter 29, without express authorization from the general court. Notwithstanding section 19A of said chapter 29, any transfer under this section shall be made by the comptroller in accordance with a transfer schedule to be developed for each item by the comptroller, after consulting with the appropriate agency secretary, the secretary of administration and finance and the state treasurer. The schedule for each appropriation shall provide for transfers in increments considered appropriate to meet the cash flow needs of each fund and all transfers under the schedule shall be completed not later than June 30, 2013.

Ã‚Â  In FY 2012, the Senate budget made clear that balancing the budget could not come at the expense of maintaining mental health services in the Commonwealth.Ã‚Â  In FY 2013, the Committee budget includes strong provisions to ensure that all regions of the state have adequate access to community and inpatient mental health services by ensuring that 45 state-operated inpatient beds remain in Southeastern Massachusetts as an independent commission examines the appropriate level of state mental health services.Ã‚Â  Maintaining regional coverage, combined with the opening of the new state of the art Worcester State Hospital, will substantially improve both the depth and scope of mental health services in the Commonwealth. In addition to mental health, the Committee budget continues to prioritize ensuring that those with physical disabilities have access to the services they need.Ã‚Â  This budget provides additional funding for Independent Living Centers as well as Turning 22 programs for both blind and developmentally delayed clients.Ã‚Â  While each of these programs serves a distinct population, they share the common theme of providing care and assistance to those of us who face the steepest challenges. The Senate has also been a leader in expanding services for those with substance abuse issues and their families.Ã‚Â  The research is clear: proactively using resources to help people overcome substance abuse problems saves lives and families, and is far less costly than waiting for those same substance abusers to develop other chronic medical conditions or enter the criminal justice system.Ã‚Â  Over the past year, the Senate has provided new resources to the Department of Public Health to develop new treatment programs, changed the process by which substance abusers can be civilly committed to treatment facilities and made it more difficult to illegally obtain prescription narcotics.Ã‚Â  This budget builds on those efforts by providing:, 1219126=SECTION 90. Section 150 of said chapter 149, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the figure Ã¢Â€Âœ33EÃ¢Â€?, in line 20, the following figure:- , 33F. Criminal Defendant Indigency Verification, 1230682=SECTION 103.

Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the agencies listed in this section may expend the amounts listed in this section for the provision of services to agencies listed in section 2. All expenditures made under this section shall be accompanied by a corresponding transfer of funds from an account listed in section 2 to the Intragovernmental Service Fund, established by section 2Q of chapter 29 of the General Laws. All revenues and other inflows shall be based on rates published by the seller agency that are developed in accordance with cost principles established by the United States Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments. All rates shall be published within 30 days of the enactment of this section. No expenditures shall be made from the Intragovernmental Service Fund which would cause that fund to be in deficit at the close of fiscal year 2013. All authorizations in this section shall be charged to the Intragovernmental Service Fund and shall not be subject to section 5D of chapter 29 of the General Laws. Any balance remaining in that fund at the close of fiscal year 2013 shall be transferred to the General Fund., 1238328=SECTION 112.

Notwithstanding section 2 of chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, except for section 12B of chapter 76 and section 89 of chapter 71 of the General Laws, for fiscal year 2013 the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city and town from item 7061-0008 of section 2 shall be as set forth in the following lists. The specified amounts to be distributed from said item 7061-0008 of said section 2 shall be in full satisfaction of the amounts due under chapter 70 of the General Laws. For fiscal year 2013, the foundation budget categories for each district shall be calculated in the same manner as in fiscal year 2012. The target local share shall be calculated using the same methodology used in fiscal year 2012. Preliminary local contribution shall be the municipality's fiscal year 2012 minimum required local contribution, increased or decreased by the municipal revenue growth factor; provided, that if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 5 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 1 percentage point; and if a municipality's preliminary contribution as a percentage of its foundation budget is more than 10 percentage points lower than the target local share, the preliminary contribution shall be recalculated using the municipality's revenue growth factor plus 2 percentage points. Minimum required local contribution for fiscal year 2013 shall be, for any municipality with a fiscal year 2013 preliminary contribution greater than its fiscal year 2013 target contribution, the preliminary local contribution reduced by 15 per cent of the gap between the preliminary local contribution and the target local contribution.

For fiscal year 2013, chapter 70 aid shall be: (a) for any district that: (i) has a target aid percentage greater than the sum of a districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid and foundation aid increment as a percentage of foundation budget; and (ii) has a combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation budget of not more than 107.5 per cent; Ã‚Â the sum of prior year aid and 25 per cent of the difference between the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s target aid amount and the sum of prior year aid and the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; (b) for any district with a positive foundation aid increment not included in (a), the sum of the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s prior year aid plus the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s foundation aid increment; and (c) for all other districts: the sum of foundation enrollment multiplied by 40 plus prior year aid. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for districts shall be determined by dividing the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield by the districtÃ¢Â€Â™s total foundation budget. Combined effort yield as a percentage of foundation for regional school districts shall be determined by allocating a member municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s combined effort yield among the districts to which said municipality belongs in direct proportion to the foundation budgets for the municipalityÃ¢Â€Â™s pupils at each of those districts. No non-operating district shall receive chapter 70 aid in an amount greater than the district's foundation budget.

In the face of persistent unemployment and slow job growth, this budget makes an investment in the future of our economy.Ã‚Â  By investing in ways to better connect our public higher education system to our workforce needs, we aim to meet the demands of the growing job sectors., 1260594=SECTION 124.

If the board of trustees determines that a modification of the 3-year plan is necessary, the trustees shall submit the modified plan to the board of higher education, the joint committee on higher education, the house and senate committees on ways and means and the secretary of education, with an explanation for the rationale behind any modifications. (c) All student charges received by the board of trustees under this section shall be retained by the university in a revolving trust fund and shall be expended as the board of trustees may direct for the operation and support of the institution. Any balance in a trust fund at the end of a fiscal year shall continue to be held in the trust fund, shall remain available for expenditure in subsequent fiscal years and shall not revert to the General Fund. All such trust funds shall be subject to audit by the state auditor., 1251391=SECTION 121.

The state board of retirement and each city, town, county and district shall verify these costs, subject to the rules adopted by the state treasurer. The state treasurer may make payments upon a transfer of funds to reimburse certain municipalities for pensions to retired teachers, including any other obligations which the commonwealth has assumed on behalf of any retirement system other than the state employees' or state teachers' retirement systems and the commonwealth's share of the amounts to be transferred pursuant to section 22B of said chapter 32 and the amounts to be transferred pursuant to clause (a) of the last paragraph of section 21 of chapter 138 of the General Laws.

To the extent that the amount transferred pursuant to said subdivision (1) of said section 22C of said chapter 32 exceeds the amount necessary to adequately fund the annual pension obligations, the excess amount shall be credited to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund, established by subdivision (8) of section 22 of said chapter 32, for the purpose of reducing the unfunded pension liability of the commonwealth., 24018=The Senate Ways and Means fiscal year 2013 budget reflects the changing landscape of how state government functions within the context of our recent economic past.Ã‚Â  Our budget clearly illustrates two vital lessons that we have learned over the past four difficult years.Ã‚Â  First, this budget emphasizes fiscal sustainability, understanding that the investments we make today are ineffective if we are unable to protect them in the crisis of tomorrow.Ã‚Â  Second, this budget prioritizes investments to help understand how we can use available resources in a way that maximizes programmatic efficiency and positive outcomes. The CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s budget applies these lessons in the midst of another challenging fiscal environment.Ã‚Â  In spite of these difficult times, the Committee budget attempts to minimize painful program cuts and make a number of new investments in education, housing and workforce development.Ã‚Â  Investments in these three areas have been instrumental in an economic recovery that has outpaced that of other states.Ã‚Â  More importantly, investments in these areas will largely define our ability to prosper in the future. The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget closes a $1.4 billion budget gap with a combination of ongoing revenue initiatives, one-time resources and spending reductions.Ã‚Â  For a second consecutive year, the Committee has been able to close the gap without an overreliance on one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  In fiscal year 2011, the state required $1.8 billion in these one-time solutions to close the budget.Ã‚Â  In FY 2012 and FY 2013 combined, the state will use less than $1 billion in one-time revenues.Ã‚Â  Over that same time period, the state has begun to rebuild its reserves, increasing the balance of the Stabilization Fund from $670 million at the end of FY 2010, to a projected balance of $1.19 billion at the end of FY 2013., 1122559=Section 5B.

L. No. 101-410 section 5, 104 Stat. 891, note following 28 U.S.C. section 2461, plus 3 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustains because of such violation. A person violating sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also be liable to the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof for the expenses of the civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysÃ¢Â€Â™ fees, reasonable expert fees and the costs of investigation, as set forth below. Costs recoverable under said sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall also include the costs of any review or investigation undertaken by the attorney general, or by the state auditor or the inspector general in cooperation with the attorney general. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if the court finds that: (1) the person committing the violation of subsection (a) furnished an official of the office of the attorney general investigating a false claims law violation with all the information known to such person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the person first obtained the information; (2) such person fully cooperated with any commonwealth investigation of such violation; and (3) at the time such person furnished the commonwealth with the information about the violation, no civil action or administrative action had commenced under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, or no criminal prosecution had commenced with respect to such violation, and such person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation, the court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of damages, including consequential damages, that the commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof sustained because of the act of that person. (c) A corporation, partnership or other person shall be liable to the commonwealth under sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, for the acts of its agent where the agent acted with apparent authority, regardless of whether the agent acted, in whole or in part, to benefit the principal and regardless of whether the principal adopted or ratified the agent's claims, representation, statement or other action or conduct. (d) Sections 5B to 5O, inclusive, shall not apply to claims, records or statements made or presented to establish, limit, reduce or evade liability for the payment of tax to the commonwealth or other governmental authority. (e) A person who has engaged in conduct described in subsection (a) prior to payment shall only be entitled to payment from the commonwealth of the actual amount due less the excess amount falsely or fraudulently claimed., 1228550=SECTION 97.

Although our economy has seen modest growth, it is as important now as ever before to continue our fiscal prudence.Ã‚Â  We will once again rise to this challenge with a balanced approach of creative solutions lowering our dependence on one time revenues and combining ongoing revenue initiatives and spending reductions to close a $1.4 billion budget gap.Ã‚Â , 1162517=SECTION 47.

(j) send a notice to any benefit recipient who requests more than 3 replacement electronic benefit transfer cards in a calendar year and monitor future requests for replacement cards; provided that the notice shall state that the department has noted an unusual number of requests for replacement electronic benefits cards and will be monitoring all future requests for replacement cards., 1229618=SECTION 100.

Extend Leasing Authority for Committee for Public Counsel Services, 1234299=SECTION 107. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, after complying with clause (a) of section 5C of chapter 29 of the General Laws, the comptroller shall dispose of the consolidated net surplus in the budgetary funds for fiscal year 2012 as follows: (i) transfer $15,000,000 from the General Fund to the Massachusetts Life Sciences Investment Fund established by section 6 of chapter 23I of the General Laws; and (ii) transfer the remaining balance from the General Fund to the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund. (b) All transfers pursuant to this section shall be made from the undesignated fund balances in the budgetary funds proportionally from the undesignated fund balances; provided, however, that no such transfer shall cause a deficit in any of the funds., 1207994=SECTION 84. Section 53 of chapter 118E of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2010 Official Edition, is hereby amended by adding the following sentence:- To the extent permitted by the demonstration program approved under 42 U.S.C. 1315(a), covered services in the MassHealth Basic and MassHealth Essential programs shall include hospice services to the extent such services are covered in the MassHealth Standard program. Childhood Vaccine Program, 28090=Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Our Communities, 1269855=SECTION 132. If, as a result of the implementation of sections 35, 43, 46 and 75, the appropriation for a state university or the University of Massachusetts is reduced in a fiscal year, after fiscal year 2013, such institution shall have the authority, notwithstanding any limitations in this act, to increase student charges for that fiscal year in order to recover the full amount of the reduction in its appropriation, subject to the approval of the board of higher education. Any such increase shall be in addition to any annual increase in charges authorized under the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s 3-year student charges plan under section 42 of chapter 15A or section 8A of chapter 75 of the General Laws, as applicable., 28709=Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA), Chapter 70 and Special Education Circuit Breaker are the three largest sources of direct state aid to cities, towns and school districts.Ã‚Â  In these three program areas alone, the Senate Ways and Means budget proposes $275.4 million in aid over the amount appropriated in the FY 2012 budget. This budget fully funds anticipated costs of the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s Special Education Circuit Breaker, estimated at $242.2 million.Ã‚Â  This reimbursement program is second to none in its importance to our schools and our communities.Ã‚Â  Each year, our schools ensure that students with special needs are able to receive the education and services they deserve in the setting that best serves them.Ã‚Â  However, in order to meet the growing cost of this obligation to our children, school districts look to the state to provide reimbursements for those special needs students with the highest cost.Ã‚Â  The Senate Ways and Means FY 2013 budget meets this shared obligation Ã¢Â€Â“ an obligation that has not been fully funded since FY 2008. In Chapter 70, too, this budget meets the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s obligations to our schools while also taking steps to address structural inequities in the aid distribution formula.Ã‚Â  The Committee budget provides $145 million in new aid to ensure that each school district receives sufficient aid to meet its Foundation Budget.Ã‚Â  In addition, this budget targets $21 million to communities that receive a smaller share of their foundation budget from the state than should be the case given their property and income wealth.Ã‚Â  This budget marks the first time since FY 2008 that funds have been specifically directed to these Ã¢Â€Âœbelow target aidÃ¢Â€? communities.Ã‚Â  Finally, this budget proposes an additional $13 million in Chapter 70 aid to ensure that all school districts receive at least an additional $40 per pupil in aid over and above FY 2012. Finally, the Committee budget provides $900 million in UGGA to municipalities.Ã‚Â  This funding level builds in both the $834 million appropriated in the FY 2012 GAA as well as the $65 million supplemental local aid payment made through FY 2011 reserves.Ã‚Â  Building this $65 million into the direct appropriation, and not making it contingent on future revenues, provides municipalities with more certainty for their budgeting processes., 1248557=SECTION 119. Notwithstanding clause (xiii) of the third paragraph of section 9A of chapter 211B of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the court administrator may, from the effective date of this act through April 30, 2013, transfer funds from any item of appropriation within the trial court to any other item of appropriation within the trial court; provided, however, that a transfer under said clause (xiii) of said section 9A of said chapter 211B shall not occur until 10 days after the revised funding schedules have been submitted in writing to the house and senate committees on ways and means; and provided further that the revised funding schedules shall include: (1) the amount of money transferred from any item of appropriation to any other item of appropriation; (2) the reason for the necessity of the transfer; and (3) the date on which the transfer shall be completed. Video Teleconferencing, 1301897=SECTION 151. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the executive office of health and human services shall convene a task force on confidentiality and data sharing, to improve services provided by the commonwealth to children, youth and families and the delivery of those services. The task force shall consist of: the secretary of health and human services, who shall serve as chair; the secretary of education or a designee; the director of Medicaid or a designee; the commissioner of developmental services or a designee; the commissioner of transitional assistance or a designee; the commissioner of children and families or a designee; the commissioner of youth services or a designee; the commissioner of early education and care or a designee; the commissioner of elementary and secondary education or a designee; and 6 persons to be appointed by the governor, 1 of whom shall work in the private sector and have specific expertise in state and federal confidentiality laws and policies, 1 of whom shall have expertise in professional licensure requirements, including codes of conduct and ethics, 1 of whom shall be an information technology expert with experience designing and implementing information technology systems, including electronic medical records, which facilitate improved data collection while also protecting client rights, 1 of whom shall be a researcher who uses data relating to state services provided to children, youth and families and 2 of whom shall be advocates for children, youth and families. The task force shall: (1) review existing laws, regulations and policies regarding confidential communications and informed consent for the purposes of making recommendations for improving personally identifiable data sharing and improving sharing of de-identified aggregate data for the purposes of program evaluation, programmatic and resource planning and development without compromising a clientÃ¢Â€Â™s rights to confidentiality; and (2) develop recommendations for a data set for personally identifiable data sharing that protects client confidentiality and does not exceed the minimum amount necessary to achieve the goals of: (i) identifying individuals receiving benefits or services from more than 1 agency or entity within the executive office of health and human services; (ii) coordinating or managing the programs, benefits or services in human services agencies available to or received by those individuals and evaluating these programs, benefits or services to identify their effects; (iii) creating and maintaining a nonduplicative client identifier system across all agencies and entities within the executive office of health and human services; and (iv) improving the educational opportunities for children receiving services from agencies within the executive office of health and human services. The task force shall report the results of its investigation and study, together with drafts of legislation necessary to carry its recommendations into effect, by filing the same with the clerks of the senate and house of representatives, who shall forward the same to the joint committee on children, families and persons with disabilities, the joint committee on mental health and substance abuse, the joint committee on public health and the house and senate committees on ways and means on or before January 1, 2013., 1189936=Section 10. (a) The commissioner of revenue shall annually on or before November 15 disburse monies from the fund established in section 9 to a city or town that has accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and notified the commissioner of its acceptance. The community shall notify the commissioner of the date and terms on which the voters accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner the amount the city or town has raised through June 30 by imposing a surcharge on its real property levy and shall certify the percentage of the surcharge applied. In the event a city or town accepts said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3 the municipal tax collecting authority shall certify to the commissioner by October 30, the maximum additional funds the city or town intends to transfer to the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund from allowable municipal sources for the following fiscal year. Once certified, the city or town may choose to transfer less than the certified amount during the following fiscal year. (b) The commissioner shall multiply the amount remaining in the fund after any disbursements for operating and administrative expenses pursuant to subsection (c) of section 9 by 80 per cent. This amount distributed in the first round distribution shall be known as the match distribution. The first round total shall be distributed to each city or town accepting said sections 3 to 7, inclusive, in an amount not less than 5 per cent but not greater than 100 per cent of the total amount raised by the additional surcharge on real property by each city or town and, if applicable, the additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of section 3. The percentage shall be the same for each city and town and shall be determined by the commissioner annually in a manner that distributes the maximum amount available to each participating city or town. (c) The commissioner shall further divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund in a second round distribution, known as the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine the equity distribution in several steps. The first step shall be to divide the remaining 20 per cent of the fund by the number of cities and towns that have accepted said sections 3 to 7, inclusive. This dividend shall be known as the base figure for equity distribution. This base figure shall be determined solely for purposes of performing the calculation for equity distribution and shall not be added to the amount received by a participant. (d) Each city and town in the commonwealth shall be assigned a community preservation rank for purposes of the equity distribution. The commissioner shall determine each community's rank by first determining the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s equalized property valuation per capita ranking, ranking cities and towns from highest to lowest valuation. The commissioner shall also determine the population of each city or town and rank each from largest to smallest in population. The commissioner shall add each equalized property valuation rank and population rank, and divide the sum by 2. The dividend shall be the community preservation raw score for that city or town. (e) The commissioner shall then order each city or town by community preservation raw score, from the lowest raw score to the highest raw score. This order shall be the community preservation rank for each city or town. If more than 1 city or town has the same community preservation raw score, the city or town with the higher equalized valuation rank shall receive the higher community preservation rank. (f) After determining the community preservation rank for each city and town, the commissioner shall divide all cities or towns into deciles according to their community preservation ranking, with approximately the same number of cities and towns in each decile, and the cities or towns with the highest community preservation rank shall be placed in the lowest decile category, starting with decile 10. Percentages shall be assigned to each decile as follows: decile 1 140 per cent of the base figure decile 2 130 per cent of the base figure decile 3 120 per cent of the base figure decile 4 110 per cent of the base figure decile 5 100 per cent of the base figure decile 6 90 per cent of the base figure decile 7 80 per cent of the base figure decile 8 70 per cent of the base figure decile 9 60 per cent of the base figure decile 10 50 per cent of the base figure After assigning each city and town to a decile according to their community preservation rank, the commissioner shall multiply the percentage assigned to that decile by the base figure to determine the second round equity distribution for each participant. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the total state contribution for each city and town shall not exceed the actual amount raised by the city or townÃ¢Â€Â™s surcharge on its real property levy and, if applicable, additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources pursuant to subsection (b1/2) of section 3. (h) When there are monies remaining in the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund after the first and second round distributions and any necessary administrative expenses have been paid in accordance with section 9, the commissioner may conduct a third round surplus distribution. Any remaining surplus in the fund may be distributed by dividing the amount of the surplus by the number of cities and towns that have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive. The resulting dividend shall be the surplus base figure. The commissioner shall then use the decile categories and percentages as defined in this section to determine a surplus equity distribution for each participant. (i) The commissioner shall determine each participant's total state grant by adding the amount received in the first round distribution with the amounts received in any later round of distributions, with the exception of a city or town that has already received a grant equal to 100 per cent of the amount the community raised by its surcharge on its real property levy. (1) Only those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge pursuant to subsection (b) of section 3 and those cities and towns that adopt the maximum surcharge and additional funds committed from allowable municipal sources such that the total funds are the equivalent of 3 per cent of the real estate tax levy against real property pursuant to subsection (bÃ‚Â½) of said section 3 shall be eligible to receive additional state monies through the equity and surplus distributions. (2) If less than 10 per cent of the cities and towns have accepted sections 3 to 7, inclusive, and imposed and collected a surcharge on their real property levy, the commissioner may calculate the state grant with only 1 round of distributions or in any other equitable manner. (j) After distributing the Massachusetts Community Preservation Trust Fund in accordance with this section, the commissioner shall keep any remaining funds in the trust for distribution in the following year., 1285121=SECTION 143. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the nursing home assessment established in subsection (b) of section 25 of chapter 118G of the General Laws shall be sufficient in the aggregate to generate $220,000,000 in fiscal year 2013., 50029=FY 2013 Budget Ã¢Â€Â“ Commitment to Fiscal Discipline, 1105932=Section 74.

(a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon the request of the board of selectmen in a town, the city council in a city with a plan E form of government or the mayor in any other city, the department of revenue may recalculate the minimum required local contribution, as defined in section 2 of chapter 70 of the General Laws, in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Based on the criteria established in this section, the department shall recalculate the minimum required local contribution for a municipality's local and regional schools and shall certify the amounts calculated to the department of elementary and secondary education. (b) A city or town that used qualifying revenue amounts in a fiscal year which are not available for use in the next fiscal year or that shall be required to use revenues for extraordinary non school-related expenses for which it did not have to use revenues in the preceding fiscal year or that has an excessive certified municipal revenue growth factor which is also greater than or equal to 1.5 times the state average municipal revenue growth factor may appeal to the department of revenue not later than October 1, 2012, for an adjustment of its minimum required local contribution and net school spending. (c) If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue may reduce proportionately the minimum required local contribution amount based on the amount of shortfall in revenue or based on the amount of increase in extraordinary expenditures in the current fiscal year, but no adjustment to the minimum required local contribution on account of an extraordinary expense in the budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, shall affect the calculation of the minimum required local contribution in subsequent fiscal years. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of free cash, overlay surplus and other available funds. (d) If upon submission of adequate documentation, the department of revenue determines that a municipality's appeal regarding an excessive municipal revenue growth factor is valid, the department shall recalculate the municipal revenue growth factor and the department of elementary and secondary education shall use the revised growth factor to calculate the preliminary local contribution, the minimum required local contribution and any other factor that directly or indirectly uses the municipal revenue growth factor. Any relief granted as a result of an excessive municipal revenue growth factor shall constitute a permanent reduction in the minimum required local contribution. (e) The board of selectmen in a town, the city council in a city with a plan E form of government, the mayor in any other city or a majority of the member municipalities of a regional school district which used qualifying revenue amounts in a fiscal year that are not available for use in the next fiscal year may appeal to the department of revenue not later than October 1, 2012, for an adjustment to its net school spending requirement. If an appeal is determined to be valid, the department of revenue shall reduce the net school spending requirement based on the amount of the shortfall in revenue and reduce the minimum required local contribution of member municipalities accordingly. Qualifying revenue amounts shall include, but not be limited to, extraordinary amounts of excess and deficiency, surplus and uncommitted reserves. (f) If the regional school budget has already been adopted by two-thirds of the member municipalities then, upon a majority vote of the member municipalities, the regional school committee shall adjust the assessments of the member municipalities in accordance with the reduction in minimum required local contributions approved by the department of revenue or the department of elementary and secondary education in accordance with this section. (g) Notwithstanding clause (14) of section 3 of chapter 214 of the General Laws or any other general or special law to the contrary, the amounts determined pursuant to this section shall be the minimum required local contribution described in chapter 70 of the General Laws. The department of revenue and the department of elementary and secondary education shall notify the house and senate committees on ways and means and the joint committee on education of the amount of any reduction in the minimum required local contribution amount. (h) If a city or town has an approved budget that exceeds the recalculated minimum required local contribution and net school spending amounts for its local school system or its recalculated minimum required local contribution to its regional school districts as provided in this section, the local appropriating authority shall determine the extent to which the community shall avail itself of any relief authorized by this section. (i) The amount of financial assistance due from the commonwealth in fiscal year 2013 pursuant to chapter 70 of the General Laws or any other law shall not be changed on account of any redetermination of the minimum required local contribution pursuant to this section. (j) The department of revenue and the department of elementary and secondary education shall issue guidelines to implement their respective duties pursuant to this section., 1175608=SECTION 54.

You can use the XML to hide existing tabs and to add new tabs, command groups, and commands. The procedures in this article show you how to add commands that are built-in to Access (such as Find, Sort, and Save) and how to add commands that run Access macros that you wrote yourself., 6128=As you begin to build more advanced applications with Office Access 2007, you might decide that you want to customize the Office Fluent Ribbon in order to make an application easier to use. For example, you can hide some or all of the default tabs so that users cannot use certain commands, and you can create new, custom tabs that contain only the commands that you want to be available., 5721=In all 2007 Microsoft Office system programs that use the Office Fluent user interface, you use Extensible Markup Language (XML) to customize the Ribbon. Therefore, some basic knowledge of XML is helpful. This article does not cover XML concepts, but it does provide you with a basic Ribbon customization procedure and some example XML that you can modify to suit your needs., 15431=Tip Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  In Access 2010, you can create custom ribbon groups and put commands in them for easy use.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â , 6507=The RibbonÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â” the strip across the top of the program window that contains groups of commandsÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â” is a component of the new Microsoft Office Fluent user interface.

Several times a month, an open mic contest is held in the Vicaro Lounge, a place for students to get together and hang out. A few times a semester, concerts have been preformed in the grassy area between buildings, affectionately nicknamed the green. Various other fun events are held around campus, like sports competitions. Basketball and dodge ball competitions have been held on camps before for teams of students that signed up to participate.', ""There are several different places to eat around campus, weather you're looking for a quick snack, or a meal between classes. The easiest places to get two are the main cafeteria, which offers access to a full all-you-can-eat bar ranging anywhere from $5 to $12 dollars a person depending on what meal is being served. Right next to the cafeteria is the Top of the Stairs snack-bar. Its not just for snacking however, they have a full grill in the back where you can purchase burgers, pizza, or even chicken strips or veggie burgers. There is also a salad bar, and every morning they have an assortment of pastries for sale. In the mood for just a snack? Try the brownies, they're definitely worth the dollar you'll spend on them. Located on the opposite end of campus is another snack-bar, though this one is just for that purpose, snacks. Here you can purchase chips, soda, water, pastries, and a few other snack foods to help keep your stomach from rumbling during classes."", ""The dorms at CAC are really great. The main campus offers three different types of student housing; towers, quads, and suites. All of the dorms have internet access, though only in the tower dorms will you not be able to access the school's wifi. The quads ans suites are similar in the fact that they are composed of four rooms, two bathrooms, and a living room. Two people share each room, and four people share the bathroom. The only difference between the suites and quads is that the quads are one story, the suites are two story. The towers are a three story building with the top two floors made up of the dorm rooms, very similar to how apartment spaces are laid out. Two side by side rooms are connected by a shared bathroom, and again its two people to each room. For the towers, an Ethernet cable is required. Living in the dorms gives students another benefit, a nineteen-meal-per-week plan that gives you access to, well, nineteen meals a week in the school's cafeteria. Students also have access to washers and dryers in several laundry rooms located around the dorm areas, however, they don't come free, you'll need a prepaid laundry card in order to use them. You can get this card easily though, and reload it whenever the need arises."", ""The classes offered at CAC will definitely put you to the test, but they aren't as scary as one might come to believe. Your professors will push you to do your best, but unlike in high school, they won't take any late assignments or accept any make up work if you're failing the class because of your own mistakes. All of the classes offer their own challenges, but if you just do the work correctly and study for tests, then I can assure you that you'll be fine. Every class has a different challenge to it, for example, if you're taking a biology class, its much more then just learning about evolution and what we're made up of. The challenge to the class is doing all of the labs correctly, and doing well on the tests, as well as learning about the building blocks of life, and how to apply what you learned in the class to other aspects of your life."", ""A few tips for prospective students would be to take full advantage of any tours offered around campus. Its easy to get lost if you don't know where you're headed, so taking a tour could save you a lot of time getting to class. Another good tip is to apply for on campus housing if you're able to; the dorms there are great because they allow you to be living right there on campus so you don't have to worry about driving to school every day in order to attend classes. My final tip would be to talk with the advisers there to find out if the degree you want to go in for is offered there at the school. Finding out later that the degree you want isn't offered there is never a good thing."", 'Central Arizona College is a wonderful place to go for students starting a college career right out of high school, or adults returning to school to get their degrees. Everyone on campus, from students to teachers, is very open and friendly, and more then willing to show new students around. The main campus itself is rather large, but being nestled at the base of a mountain, displays beautiful scenery and provides an excellent place to star gaze at night for any astronomy students.']]",Central Arizona College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Central-Arizona-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/95956,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00206-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,890230323,890185981,HORIZONTAL,,"08/23/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 5 out of 6 people found this review useful. 1 of 45 ROSEMARY from Queen Creek, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The only difference between the suites and quads is that the quads are one story, the suites are two story. The towers are a three story building with the top two floors made up of the dorm rooms, very similar to how apartment spaces are laid out. Two side by side rooms are connected by a shared bathroom, and again its two people to each room. For the towers, an Ethernet cable is required. Living in the dorms gives students another benefit, a nineteen-meal-per-week plan that gives you access to, well, nineteen meals a week in the school's cafeteria.

As we slide down the left of the curve where things are flatter, the improvement in performance lowers. This is a Ponder curve, mapping millisecond response (MSR) times for different levels of I/O per second, named after the IBM scientist John Ponder that created them. Most disk array vendors will publish similar curves for each of their products. In this case, we see that 100,000 IOPS would cause a 25 millisecond response (MSR) time, but when the load is reduced to 55,000 IOPS, the average response time drops to only 7 msec. To be fair, the SVC does introduce 0.06 msec of additional latency on read-misses, so let's call this 7.06 msec. This tiny amount of latency could be what Hu Yoshida was referring to when he said there was ""some performance degradation"". There are other storage virtualization products in the market that do not provide caching to boost performance, but rather just map incoming requests to outgoing requests, and these can indeed slow down every I/O they process. Perhaps Hu was thinking of those instead of IBM's SVC when he made his comments. In this example, the SVC reduced the burden of the managed disk","Hitachi's offerings, including the HDS USP-V, USP-VM and their recently announced Virtual Storage Platform (VSP) sold also by HP under the name P9500, have similar architecture to the SVC and can offer similar benefits, but oddly the Hitachi engineers have decided to treat externally attached storage as second-class citizens instead. Hu mentions data that ""ages out or becomes less active we can move it to the external storage.""Ã‚Â  IBM has chosen not to impose this ""caste"" system onto its design of the SAN Volume Controller. The SVC has been around since 2003, before the USP-V came to market, and has sold over 20,000 SVC nodes over the past seven years. The SVC can indeed improve performance of managed disk systems, in some cases by a substantial amount.Ã‚Â  The 0.06 msec latency on read-miss requests represents less than 1 percent of total performance in production workloads.Ã‚Â  SVC nearly always improves performance, and in the worst case, provides same performance but with added functionality and flexibility. For the most part, the performance boost comes as a delightful surprise to most people who start using the SVC.

Storage virtualization can be employed to help solve this problem. I define virtualization as ""technology that makes one set of resources look and feel like a different set of resources, preferably with more desirable characteristics."". By making different storage resources, old and new, look and feel like a single type of resource, migration can be performed without disrupting applications. Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions.

I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array. Problem: migration from old gear to new gear, old technology to new technology, from one vendor to another vendor, is disruptive, time-consuming and painful. Let's start with the problem we are trying to solve.","For IBM, the motivation was clear: Protect customers existing investment in older storage arrays and introduce new IBM storage with a solution that allows both to be managed with a single set of interfaces and provide a common set of functionality, improving capacity utilization and availability. IBM SAN Volume Controller eliminated vendor lock-in, providing clients choice in multi-pathing driver, and allowing any-to-any migration and copy services. For example, IBM SVC can be used to help migrate data from an old HDS USP-V to a new HDS USP-V.

Storage virtualization can be employed to help solve this problem. I define virtualization as ""technology that makes one set of resources look and feel like a different set of resources, preferably with more desirable characteristics."". By making different storage resources, old and new, look and feel like a single type of resource, migration can be performed without disrupting applications. Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions. IT storage can be expensive, so companies would like their new purchases to be fully utilized on day 1, and be completely empty on day 1500 when the lease expires. I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array. Problem: migration from old gear to new gear, old technology to new technology, from one vendor to another vendor, is disruptive, time-consuming and painful. Let's start with the problem we are trying to solve.","Campus-wide access SVC Split-Cluster allows concurrent read/write access of data to be accessed from hosts at two different locations several miles apart I don't think so PLEX-Metro, similar in concept but implemented differently Non-disruptive tech refresh Can upgrade or replace storage arrays, SAN switches, and even the SVC nodes software AND hardware themselves, non-disruptively Tech refresh for storage arrays, but not for Invista CPCs Tech refresh of back end devices, and upgrade of VPLEX software, non-disruptively. Not clear if VPLEX engines themselves can be upgraded non-disruptively like the SVC. Heterogeneous Storage Support Broad support of over 140 different storage models from all major vendors, including all CLARiiON, Symmetrix and VMAX from EMC, and storage from many smaller startups you may not have heard of Limited support Invista-like. VPLEX claims to support a variety of arrays from a variety of vendors, but as far as I can find, only DS8000 supported from the list of IBM devices. Fellow blogger Barry Burke (EMC) suggests [putting SVC between VPLEX and third party storage devices] to get the heterogeneous coverage most companies demand. Back-end storage requirement Must define quorum disks on any IBM or non-IBM back end storage array. SVC can run entirely on non-IBM storage arrays None HP SVSP-like, requires at least one EMC storage array to hold metadata Internal storage SVC 2145-CF8 model supports up to four solid-state drives (SSD) per node that can treated as managed",True,0,-1,"{146108=Back in 2006, fellow blogger Chuck Hollis (EMC) suggested that SVC was just a [bump in the wire] which could not possibly improve performance of existing disk arrays. IBM showed clients that putting cache(SVC) in front of other cache(back end devices) does indeed improve performance, in the same way that multi-core processors successfully use L1/L2/L3 cache. Now, EMC is claiming their cache-based VPLEX improves performance of back-end disk. My how EMC's story has changed!, 81060=You might be scratching your head on this one. Wasn't the LTFS v2.1 announced May 9? Actually, it was for the TS3500, TS3200 and TS3100. On this announcement, the [ IBM System Storage Linear Tape File System Library Edition Version 2.1] was extended to support the rest of our tape library portfolio, specifically the TS3310 and TS2900., 145729=With EMC, however, the motivation appeared to protect software revenues from their PowerPath multi-pathing driver, TimeFinder and SRDF copy services. Back in 2005, when EMC Invista was first announced, these three software represented 60 percent of EMC's bottom-line profit. (Ok, I made that last part up, but you get my point! EMC charges a lot for these.), 153565=technorati tags: IBM, SVC, 2145-CF8, SSD, FlashCopy, Metro+Mirror, Global+Mirror, EMC, VPLEX, CLARiiON, Symmetrix, VMAX, storage, virtualization, non-disruptive, HDS, USP-V, USP-VM, HP, SVSP,, 125916=Since day 1, SAN Volume Controllers has focused primarily on external storage. Initially, the early models had just battery-protected DRAM cache memory, but the most recent model of the SVC, the 2145-CF8, adds support for internal SLC NAND flash solid state drives. To fully appreciate how SVC can help improve the performance of the disks that are managed, I need to use some visual aids., 142492=Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions. IT storage can be expensive, so companies would like their new purchases to be fully utilized on day 1, and be completely empty on day 1500 when the lease expires. I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array., 78750=The new [IBM System Storage Tape Controller 3592 Model C07] is an upgrade to the previous C06 controller. Like the C06, the new 3592-C07 can have up to four FICON (4Gbps) ports, four FC ports, and connect up to 16 drives. The difference is that the C07 supports 8Gbps speed FC ports, and can support the [new TS1140 tape drives that were announced on May 9]. A cool feature of the C07 is that it has a built-in library manager function for the mainframe. On the previous models, you had to have a separate library manager server., 131468=The SVC has been around since 2003, before the USP-V came to market, and has sold over 20,000 SVC nodes over the past seven years. The SVC can indeed improve performance of managed disk systems, in some cases by a substantial amount.Ã‚Â  The 0.06 msec latency on read-miss requests represents less than 1 percent of total performance in production workloads.Ã‚Â  SVC nearly always improves performance, and in the worst case, provides same performance but with added functionality and flexibility. For the most part, the performance boost comes as a delightful surprise to most people who start using the SVC., 101805=The analyst mentioned EMC's failed product Invista, which sold less than 500 units over the past five years. The low penetration for external virtualization, estimated between 2-5 percent, could be explained from the bad taste that left in everyone considering their options. However, the analyst predicts that by 2015, external virtualization will reach double digit marketshare., 112928=There are lots of analysts that track market share for the IT storage industry, but since Chuck mentions [IDC] specifically, I reviewed the most recent IDC data, published a few weeks ago in their ""IDC Worldwide Quarter Disk Storage Tracker"" for 2Q 2010, representing April 1 to June 30, 2010 sales. Just in case any of the rankings have changed over time, I also looked at the previous four quarters: 2Q 2009, 3Q 2009, 4Q 2009 and 1Q 2010., 70278=technorati tags: IBM, XIV, DDF, RAID-5, RAID-10, RAID-X, RAID-6, RAID-DP, HP, EVA, HDS, USP-V, EMC, CLARiiON, V-Max, Disaster Recovery, HGST, UltraStar, A7K1000, 86726=technorati tags: xiv, rv1, Information Archive, Tape Sticks, 3592, emc, symmetrix, hds, c07, usp-v, crossroads, readverify, hewlett-packard, ltfs, sonas, p9500, vmax, ts3310, ts2900, vsp, archiveverify, ibm, ts3500, 93509=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Thursday morning had some interesting sessions for those that did not leave town last night., 81734=Saving the biggest announcement for last, IBM announces new [XIV Generation 3 hardware] and corresponding [XIV Software Version 11.0.0]. The new hardware is officially the model 114, but since today's new zEnterprise announced today is also ""model 114"", I will refer unofficially to the current XIV hardware that [IBM launched initially in September 2008] as ""Gen2"", and the new XIV Gen3 hardware as ""Gen3"" to avoid confusion., 50202=If these three methods of protection sound familiar, I mentioned them in my post about [Pulse conference, Data Protection Strategies] back in May 2008.}",

The 0th index of the array passed to glDrawBuffersÃ¢Â€Â‹ contains GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT4. Therefore, the value written to diffuseColorÃ¢Â€Â‹ will go to the buffer bound to the GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT4 slot. Here's a table of the outputs and the associated buffers: layout(location = 2) out vec4 specularColor; layout(location = 3) out vec3 position; layout(location = 0) out vec4 diffuseColor; layout(location = 4) out vec3 normal; layout(location = 1) out int materialID;  And we set up our output variables like this:   glDrawBuffers(4, buffers); const GLenum buffers[] = {GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT4, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT2, GL_NONE, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0};  The mapping between fragment colors and actual buffers within a Framebuffer is defined by glDrawBuffersÃ¢Â€Â‹, which is part of the framebuffer's state. For example, if we set our draw buffers up like this: The limit on the number of fragment colors is defined by GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERSÃ¢Â€Â‹, or GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS when using dual-source blending as below. Fragment shader output variables can be aggregated into arrays (though you are strongly advised to avoid this).","normalÃ¢Â€Â‹ is assigned GL_NONE (and therefore the written value is discard) because it attempts to access an index that was beyond the size of the array passed to glDrawBuffersÃ¢Â€Â‹. All of those indices implicitly use GL_NONE. specularColorÃ¢Â€Â‹ is assigned GL_NONE because that is what was given for the 2nd index (zero-based) of the array. Dual-source blending Main article: Blending#Dual_Source_Blending Dual-source blending is a technique whereby two (or theoretically more) output values can be used on the same buffer via blending. It is a way to get more values into the blend equation. This is achieved by assigning another parameter to fragment output variables: an index. All outputs have an index in addition to a fragment color number. If any of the outputs is assigned a non-zero index, then the fragment shader uses dual-source blending. When a fragment shader provides dual-source output, it reduces the number of buffers it can write to. The new maximum fragment color output is GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS, which is 1 on every piece of hardware that supports this feature. In short: if you want dual-source blending, you can only write to one buffer from the fragment shader. The index of a fragment shader output can be assigned similarly to the fragment color. There is an in-shader specification: layout(location =",True,0,0,,

The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011.
