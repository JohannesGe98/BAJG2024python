This is a different atmosphere from a typical college life. Younger students might be uncomfortable here at first, but older students will feel right at home.', ""Online classes are DEFINITELY worth it. However, I would not recommend traditional classes unless a student is only interested in passing. If you don't care about grades and learning, then yes, traditional classes are probably a good choice. If you show up, you are almost guaranteed to pass. Honestly, the teachers know how bad they are and they pass everyone who comes to class. Personally, I am concerned about my GPA and what I am learning. My GPA has been brought down by teachers who didn't enter my grades into the system, and I have learned nothing other than what I have taught myself."", ""At the Virginia Beach campus: They do have a small cafeteria which is open weekdays for lunch. However, most students leave for lunch. There are several restaurants right outside of campus. They have two Starbucks on campus, but they are TERRIBLE. I've gone there 5 times, and each time my coffee was not drinkable. They only hire TCC students, which I guess are really bad at making coffee."", 'There are no dorms since it is a community college. However there are several nice apartment communities next to the Virginia Beach campus that are within walking distance.', ""They do have some good teachers, but this is not at all the norm. The majority of teachers are pretty bad. They waste all of class time talking about things that are unimportant, and then the tests are off of things were not talked about. It's nearly impossible to do well on tests. Often teachers give tests with obscure questions that even if you had the textbook book in front you, you couldn't figure it out. Some teachers give online assignments on your days off, and unless you faithfully check the site every 24 hours, you miss the assignment. Really, the only way to learn anything is through reading and studying the text book. Some teachers never teach a thing."", 'I suggest taking online classes from TCC. I have had a good experience with this. Traditional class is really a waste of time since many of the teachers are so bad. Most of the teachers struggle to communicate what they want you to understand, and they end up not covering the material. DO NOT buy your textbooks from them TCC bookstore! They will charge you $200 for a textbook you can get online for $25. The bookstore is supposed to be responsible for which books you need for specific classes, but often they are wrong, so you need to email your teachers directly to ask which books they want you to get.', ""In short: you get what you pay for.
