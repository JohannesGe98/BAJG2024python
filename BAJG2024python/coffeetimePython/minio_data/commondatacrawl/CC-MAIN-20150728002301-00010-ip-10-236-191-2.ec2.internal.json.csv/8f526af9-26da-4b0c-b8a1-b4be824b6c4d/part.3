ª²Ø¿9ØZÃ£·v·Æj^fÉæ^>l crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school is known for its outstanding engineering program and it can easily be seen as almost 40% of my freshman class were engineers. Tech is surrounded by the Blue Ridge mountains which are an amazing sight to see even though it does make the weather a bit crazy sometimes. Students who love to get involved will have no problem fitting in here as there are literally hundreds of different clubs and activities to take part in, everything from Model UN to innertube water polo can be found here.', ""If you're coming here, you've made a great choice already so just remember a few key things before moving in. First of all, make sure you go for the upgraded bigger meal plan. The food here is so good that you can't help but run out with the smaller plan so the bigger one is definitely recommended. Secondly, when you get there make sure you go to as many events as you can fit into your schedule. This includes football games, basketball games, housing fairs and tons of free cookouts throughout the year. At almost every event there is sure to be free food and tons of other free stuff so it is definitely worth it. Also be sure to introduce yourself to as many people as possible, you can never have too many friends at college."", 'For out of state students such as myself, this can be a pretty costly school to go to. However, if one thing is sure, it is definitely worth every penny. Meeting students from every part of the world is just one advantage that makes this school so unique. Another major advantage is that many companies come to Tech looking for workers so on top of the excellent degree, especially in engineering, you will also almost certainly be lined up with a job before you even graduate.', 'On campus can be a lot of fun, off campus can be a whole lot of fun. One of the best things about Tech is that there is always something to do for everyone. The party scene is amazing and can be a great time as long as you know how to handle yourself out there, but even on campus you can still enjoy yourself. Midnight volleyball at one of the many courts, late night movie nights until 3am and even just lounging on the drillfield are just some of the on campus events that offer a great time with the new friends you meet at school.', ""As an engineering major, the course load is always challenging and at times can be somewhat ridiculous. But as long as you put in the effort, you will learn more than you ever thought possible with Tech's vast amount of highly experienced professors in many fields of study. With options from sustainability to nanotechnology you will learn all about how these not only work but can be used together to invent the future. Best of all, that's just in the first semester. There is so much you learn not just from professors but from other students as well that makes the college experience so much more interesting.""]]",Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Virginia-Polytechnic-Institute-and-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/96398,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,56,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00010-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,907421019,907257245,HORIZONTAL,,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 22 out of 22 people found this review useful. 1 of 210 Tiara from Chesterfield, VA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities.

There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like!

It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

With so many students on campus, it can sometimes take a while to hear back from your advisor about class scheduling, etc (especially if you are in a bigger major). However, I have been able to answer a large majority of my own questions just by looking on the Tech homepage or the specific pages for each department. There are a lot of resources on the website that students just aren't aware of, so before sending frantic emails to your advisor when you have a last minute question, take a look at the homepage!"", ""Tech is absolutely a great investment for Virginia residents: for a four-year university, the in-state tuition is fairly affordable and worth every penny.

Your new best friend could be living right next door!', 'At Virginia Tech, you can always be assured that your professors are going to be experts and have personal experience in the fields that they are teaching.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it.

These kinds of people make the best educators.']]",Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Virginia-Polytechnic-Institute-and-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/96398,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,60,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00010-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,907421019,907257245,HORIZONTAL,,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 22 out of 22 people found this review useful. 1 of 210 Tiara from Chesterfield, VA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community.

For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses.

This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget.

In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services.

At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable.

The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman.

After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger.

You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology.

I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!!

Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology.

Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus.

New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Tech offers many ways to help pay for the expense which is very helpful. Am enjoying being here Virginia Tech is great. I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major. Login to rate or flag the reviews",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community.

I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs.

It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly.

The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you.

Tech offers many ways to help pay for the expense which is very helpful. Am enjoying being here Virginia Tech is great. I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major. Login to rate or flag the reviews",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it.

Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy.

It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold.

As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well.

A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark.",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred.

Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt.

Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold.

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year.

It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy.

Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more.

We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed. Login to rate or flag the reviews Michael from Kapolei, HI 12/26/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 17 out of 17 people found this review useful.",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like!

Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options.

You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus.

All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology.

From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year!

The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable.

The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman.

After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger.

Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community.

May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more.

There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too.

There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal.

There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident.

There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman.

After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing.

Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger!

There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year!

Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself).

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology.

It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly.

Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy.

Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge.",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year!

If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced.

There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred.

The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable.

The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study.

As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well.

There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night.

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal.

I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge.

It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge!

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge!

Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number one dining halls in the nation? The food is great and you never have to go hungry. Am learning a lot For prospective engineering students, look no further than Virginia Tech. The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself).

There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs.

Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger!

This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well.

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study.

The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I participated in all of the musicals and was in three different choirs by the time I was a senior. It was the only thing that was constant through my entire music career and was the venue by which I made most of my best friends. I was worried about how my love of music would transfer once I entered college, especially considering that my major had nothing to do with music. When I got on campus, students were made aware of the many opportunities for students to involve themselves in clubs and other activities. I immediately began to think about auditioning for an a cappella group on campus and was overjoyed when I was accepted into my first choice as a freshman. It has provided me with so many friends of different ages and personalities and opportunities to grow both as a musician and as a person.', 'Virginia TechÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â¢Ãƒ\x82?Ãƒ\x82?s football games are the place to be. Students and fans from all over the country gather at Lane Stadium to watch their Hokies take on whatever team is so unfortunate to be on the opposing team. In addition to football, Virginia Tech athletics include sports such as basketball, soccer, and volleyball. If you love sports, Virginia Tech is the spot for you!', 'Downtown Blacksburg is a great place to be. It has several shops and eating places for all ages to enjoy. It also it the prime place for bands to hold concerts and groups of people to meet up. Another place that many people enjoy is the drill field. It separates the housing part of campus from the academic part of campus and is a popular spot for people to play Ulitmate Frisbee, soccer, or just lounge in the sun. The Squires Student center is also a hotspot for student activity as it contains a bowling alley and several classrooms as well as an area for people to watch sports.', 'The food at Virginia Tech is some of the best college food in the nation. The campus boasts several dining halls, many of which use food fresh from nearby farms. Additionally, some of the dining halls feature many popular dining chains such as Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, DunkinÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â¢Ãƒ\x82?Ãƒ\x82?

It is clear that whatever your heart desires can be found almost anywhere at Virginia Tech.', 'Dorm life for me has been great. I am a member of a learning community on campus called the Residential Community at West Ambler Johnston. It was recently renovated and contains many amenities such as a fully-stocked kitchen, carpeted rooms, stalled showers, air conditioning, four lounges and two study rooms per floor, a gym, elevators, and even a movie theater. I canÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â¢Ãƒ\x82?Ãƒ\x82?t speak for those living elsewhere on campus, but my experience with dorms has been very pleasant. Additionally, some of the living communities offer mixed rooming. That is to say that a freshman may be randomly selected to room with a sophomore. While this may seem strange or out of the ordinary, it adds an air of community and connectedness between all grade levels and ages of students.', 'I assume that the answer to this question will vary according to major. I just completed my first semester of classes at Virginia Tech and was surprised at how different it was from high school. Some days, I might only have an hour and fifteen minutes of classes, and I would have to decide what to do with the rest of my day. It was a learning experience. Time management is definitely key at Virginia Tech and is a skill that I am still working on mastering. Though many of the classes are difficult, they are doable if you are focused and work hard.', 'Visit the school! There are so many things for students to do on campus! Find out what they are; there is sure to be something that interests you. Additionally, I suggest that all prospective students sit in on a class. Virginia Tech is a big place and as a result, many of the classes are very large. Students should see if that style of learning is best suited to them before deciding on a school.', 'I visited Virginia Tech in the fall of my senior year and fell in love.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night.

The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007.

Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!!

At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable.

The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

Find some student program or event that catches your interest",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up.

It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced.

It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more.

It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad.

In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it.

We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech was my first choice when I was college hunting, but I expected that I would not be able to pay for it. To my surprise, other schools such as the University of Virginia and others were several thousand dollars more expensive. So not only does Virginia Tech provide an excellent education, but it does so at a fantastic value! It's really quite a deal. Am enjoying being here There are well over 100 student programs on campus in Virginia Tech, so a student always has something to do with his/her free time. Whatever the hobby, whether that's sports, games, cultural experiences, etc., there's a group for that. If not, then a student can always make a new group with at least two other people. Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced. Did I mention that Virginia Tech has been recently voted the number",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Tech offers many ways to help pay for the expense which is very helpful. Am enjoying being here Virginia Tech is great. I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community.

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more.

Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I had to take some loans out to go here but after 2 years there i owe about 8k which isnt terrible for two years of school.

This is because the entire time period between that is normally too cold for people to just be outside throwing the football or whatever. However, the football games are what entertains the masses for most of the year. They are quite fun to go to, the stadium is always packed, always loud, and always a good time.', 'Hands down the best thing at Tech. The food is amazing. Pretty much anything you could want at almost all times of the day. D2 is a buffet style place that serves just about any type of food you can think of.

Their dining services are ranked nationally and they do everything they can to maintain their ranking.', 'Okay, I am probably an exception here. I was miserable freshman year in the dorms. I can blame that on living in Slusher Hall though, the first dorm building built at Tech.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe.

Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold.

If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself).

If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE!

The school has one of the finest engineering programs in the country and as such all graduates leave with a slight advantage in their job hunt. It is a very rigorous program, but you learn quickly and efficiently. To start off, you enhance your math skills with basic calculus and linear algebra, study chemistry, and learn the basic of engineering and design in a workshop. These include studying the individual fields within the engineering discipline, working with LabVIEW programming, understanding the design process, and even building your first prototype in a team environment. It's a very hands-on process and the professors are eager to help their students succeed. For those who are not interested in engineering, don't count of Virginia Tech just yet. It also has excellent architecture, science, and business majors, and many more. Whether you intend to study in the field of technology or liberal arts, Virginia Tech provides all the resources a student could possibly need to succeed.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Student organizations are a great way to get connected on campus and forge lifelong relationships. Virginia Tech has a strict anti-discrimination policy. The goal is for every man or woman of any ethnic or religious group to have an equal opportunity and the right to live on campus without fear of prejudice. These standards are strictly enforced.

Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

No question about it. The school's reputation is strongly founded in that program. Any engineering student would do well to choose Virginia Tech as a prospective college. Virginia Tech has several programs, but architecture to business to art. As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study.

Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve.

I have met so many amazing people from so many different backgrounds which have exposed me to things I may have never encountered. Also I have gotten the chance to travel to different colleges through my involvement with the Women's Rugby team, which I probably would have never experienced. Am learning a lot At Tech the professors have experience in the fields in which they teach so not only do the provide book lessons, but also life lessons. As a double major in Communication and Theater Arts and a Spanish minor i get a very diverse exposure to different classes. Within both my majors the departments ask for students to take classes within the major that is outside of our concentration, which provides students with a chance to get a glimpse of different aspects of the major, and even if there is no interest in the other aspects, students can develop an appreciation for the other parts of the major.

There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results.

As an engineering student myself, I cannot speak with certainty about these majors, but if my own classes and professors are any sort of indicator, I would guess that Virginia Tech provides plenty of resources and opportunities for these students as well. Basically what I'm trying to say is that just because Virginia Tech is known as a technology school, don't count it out if you aren't interested in technology. It's an incredible school and I would strongly recommend at least attending an information session to see your options. Tips for prospective students Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a",True,0,0,"{198051=The food needs no comment, it is purely amazing. There is no need to eat off campus ever. There are so many options to choose from, include ABP, Pizza Hut, Chick-Fil-A, Sbarro, Cinnabon, Caravel, and many more non name brand facilities. Aside from that, a new dining hall is set to open Fall 2012, with a sushi bar, Qdoba, and a Japanese steakhouse., 621877=Dorm life is the perfect chance to get to know your fellow Hokies and even get out of your comfort level by sharing a small space with a stranger! May be frightening at first, but the stories, laughs and friendships that come with it are all worth it in the end!, 484713=Virginia Tech has a reputation of being a dangerous place because of the shooting in 2007, but the campus has become a safer place. There are many structures built around campus with a button that can be pressed to get policemen to quickly come over. Policemen offer rides to anyone who is afraid to walk alone at night. There is also RAD, which teaches women how to protect themselves if they are attacked by men., 101712=Football games: Enter Sandman; Let's Go! Hokies!; The Spring Game; April 16th Memorial Service; Relay for Life!; Squire's Student Center; The Drillfield., 559187=The food on campus is pretty good. There are a lot of great places to eat both on and off campus. Yes, there is a dining hall where you can order steak and lobster. VT always finds a way to up their dining hall game. New dining halls have been added since I graduated in 2011., 739832=Virginia Tech offers 76 masters and 62 doctoral degrees through nine academic colleges. There are many majors that you can choose from and the student faculty ratio is 16:1., 32771=It should be warned that Blacksburg weather is slightly bipolar. During the school year from August to May, we have about two months of warm weather, 2 months of in between when the weather can't decide between warm or cold, and then about 5 months of pretty cold. If you don't like the cold you may not like Tech. During the late spring and early fall semester the campus is beautiful, warm, and everything is bright green. However, try to remember this is the mountains. The campus is still beautiful but it will get cold here, so if you aren't used to the winter, or don't like the cold this might not be the school for you. New students, invest in a BIG Jacket and gloves and a hat you will need it strolling across the drill field., 324832=Ever since the incident on April 16th, the school has done everything in its power to ensure that the students are safe. The only way that students are able to access their dorm is by using their ID card to unlock the door. Each students ID card is only able to unlock the doors to their dorm. Also, any time a crime is committed, the school sends out an alert within the hour notifying every student about all of the details of the incident. Despite the history of this school, I have always felt extremely safe and secure at Virginia Tech., 47703=Wonderful food, even in the cheaper dining halls. There are many choices from student suggested venues to commercial chains. A brand new dining hall is opening summer 2012 on the academic side of campus., 192151=We have the best police officers in Blacksburg, and the best campus police officers that I have yet to come in contact with. All of those that I have met have been extremely helpful, and I feel very safe here at Tech. Earlier this year we experienced a threat, and the entire campus went into lockdown. The police officers protected all of us very well, and I feel proud to go to a university that has such loyal officers. The campus alert system that was placed into effect after April 16, 2007 is very effective. Text messages or phone calls, whichever you prefer, are sent out within minutes of the need for the alert. Emails are also received, and the alert circulates through the classrooms on campus over the digital clocks that are present in each classroom., 684991=After 2006 incident, our campus safety has widely increased. We have emergency buttons all across campus. The police will come in about 30 secs after pressing the button., 685378=We always hold 3.2K for 32 people who died on April 16th, 2006. There is the corps that always fires skipper during the football games whenever we do a touchdown., 5366=Obviously I would recommend that you study hard and keep your high school GPA up. That certainly helps for admission. Virginia Tech recieves thousands of applications every semester, so you'll want to keep an edge. I also recommend a lot of community involvement and extra-curricular programs. If you have the opportunity to cultivate leadership skills, whether in a job or an organization, do it. It looks fantastic on an application. As a fair warning, college life is nothing like high school life. They are not even in the same ballpark. For a lot of students entering Virginia Tech, they did not even have to study to succeed in college. The engineering class fo 2013 entered campus with an average GPA of 3.97, to give you an idea. But college has a tendancy to weed out the students that cannot adapt and take their education seriously. Expect to spend the majority of your day behind a desk with your nose buried in some book, working out derivatives or determining the quantum structure of an atom. If you don't think you can handle spending at least eight hours a day studying, then perhaps you should rethink pursuing college. It's a very trying experience, but the rewards are definitely worth it. Studying for so long can leave you exhausted, so I strongly recommend breaking it up into pieces and taking short, fun breaks. Find some student program or event that catches your interest and check it out. If I hadn't found Campus Crusade to break up my Thursday nights, I probably would go mad. These events help your mind to relax and you're refreshed for the next stretch of studying. Another tip: do not neglect your nutrition. I've seen it happen many times (and I was guilty of it myself). Students are finally free from their parents' control and decide they want to eat whatever they want. Pizza for breakfast, cake with every meal, burgers and fries galore. Virginia Tech has so many great dining halls, this is easy to achieve. It's fun for a little while, but eventually it starts to drain you. Even worse, poor nutrition affects your mental capabilities. If you eat lots of fats and sugars before a test, the blood in your body swarms around your stomach to process the food, leaving a slight shortage in the brain. This often affects your test results. Eat plenty of protein and vegetables and let the junk food be an occassional treat., 155028=Tech has stepped up security and alerts greatly since 2007. Every student is SAFE! Sign up yourself and your parents for VT alerts to get up to date info., 341907=Believe it or not but VT is actually one of the safest campuses. Since the 4/16 shooting in 2007 the university has implemented multiple policies and emergency action plans as well as update all security in all buildings., 891174=All of the buildings are built to waste as much money as possible using a Limestone (Hokie Stone) facade. This facade adds at least a million dollars to the cost of each new building, money that could be better spent on building larger buildings or buying and improving existing buildings and equipment. There is also the Lets get wasted for every football game tradition. This absolutely disparages the upstanding militaristic and Christian values that the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded on back in 1872., 607095=Very safe, since April 16 2007 the police forces of VT and Blacksburg keep VT very very safe!, 776286=April 16, 2007 is a year that Hokies will never forget. Many people around the world were made aware of the tragic events of this day in Virginia TechÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s History. We donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?t try to ignore it, but to strive to do better. In my four months on campus, I have never felt unsafe, if even for a moment. I think that the tragedy has not made us weaker, but stronger, as students and as Hokie Nation., 600830=Virginia Tech was ranked #2 in 2012 in the nation in dining services. In 2013, it will be ranked #1 with the addition of Turner Place., 257626=I am looking forward to attending Virginia Tech. I moved to Blacksburg in July and I love this town!! I have accidentally found myself on campus several times and I must say I am in love with the look of the campus. It huge and beautiful!!, 859916=There are over 300 different clubs here at Tech, so you are sure to find one you like! At an event called Gobblerfest in September, you get to see all the different ones and check them out :), 718261=VT police are always on campus. Despite what some people think about the tragedy that happened in 2007, this campus is very safe. It is enclosed and away from big cities and highways. What happened in 2007 was horrible, but could have happened just about anywhere and is no reflection of VT safety. Since then however, safety measures have been upped tenfold. We get emails and texts immediately in an emergency situation. I only gave 4 stars, rather than 5 because I think more blue lights would be beneficial., 796158=Virginia Tech is an innovative and inspiring place to study. It is an extremely safe campus and everyone on it wants their fellow Hokie to succeed. Students are pushed to challenge themselves and are encouraged to be part of the community. Virginia Tech's motto Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) encourages all students to take an active role in their community., 242937=Make sure your math skills are up there prior and at the same time at least aim for a 1680 on your SAT when applying just be yourself you don't have to write a formal essay make the person reading your essay and chuckle if not that tell them how unique your are be willing to take the SAT and ACT and be well rounded all wells email your academic counselor just to let them now hows things are going it will better your chances of getting into the school., 139208=I am absolutely loving it. From the first time I stepped on campus way back in November of last year to orientation and moving day, there hasn't been a moment where I didn't love the experience. There are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to join, and they have a day in September where all of those organizations come out in one area to find new members. The whole big campus issue is really a non-issue. You quickly adjust to how far all of the buildings are on campus and adjust accordingly. It has been a blast to be going here, even though it is a whole 8 hours away from my home., 872010=Pretty good school overall. However, it just wasn't for me. I went there wanting to become an engineer and after taking a few classes, I realized engineering was not what i wanted to do. So, i switched my major to Information Technology, but I didnt like the curriculum that Tech offered so i have since transferred. Also, the school is very cold which i didnt like, but if you like snowboarding or winter sports like that you will probably like the school, it snowed in April last year! Too cold for me., 813481=Relay for Life is huge! Make A Wish is also very big and there is even an annual 'The Big Event' that is held every April which is one of the biggest volunteer events in the nation!, 522888=Virginia Tech's campus is now more secure than ever since the event in 2007. There are now Emergency Light poles that allows individuals to hit a button in case of emergency. Police will also walk individuals back to their dorms late at night if they are uncomfortable. The VT Alert system is working perfectly which notifies students and staffs in case of emergency by email, texts, and messages on the clock. The safety of students on campus can not be questioned at Virginia Tech., 642973=Boudreaux is a wonderful cajun restaurant. Cabo Fish Taco has great Mexican food, and it's affordable. Moe's is even more affordable, but still great, especially if you're on the go., 911133=Everyone mentioned the crazy weather and it was true - weird blustery wind the day we visited in November., 143408=You make so many good friends here and there is tons to do on campus. however, when it gets to be November, December, it's colder than the ice age and everyone starts to get cabin fever., 918745=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608016=The Corps of Cadets have been here since the day the university opened in 1872, so the traditions the cadets have are spectacular. The drill field is a huge gathering place for all students. Then there is Hokie football, there is nothing else like, the best way to spend a fall Saturday., 721843=I had so much fun my Freshman year. The dorms are all relatively near each other so it is easy to meet up with friends wherever you are. They are also all near a dining center and a gym, so eating and recreation are easily accessible. It is so much fun getting to know so many people when you first get to school- it makes the transition very easy. The cleaning staff in the dorms are great- it seems impossible to keep a building of 1000 teenagers clean, but they do a good job., 703726=The school has many traditions to include the ring dance or the burning VT. The Corps of Cadets have an important tradition. They have the Caldwell March. It is hike for the freshman to symbolize their progress becoming an upperclassman. They take the route that the first student from Virginia Tech took. He walked all the way to Virginia Tech from his home. There are two parts to the march. After the last part of the march, the underclassman become upperclassmen., 563176=Despite the many rumors about Virginia Tech, the campus is safe. I have never felt threatened or in danger. Any incidents that have happened since the shooting in 2007 have been from people who did not attend Virginia Tech. Like anywhere else in this world, don't be dumb or make stupid decisions and you'll be safe., 187913=The mountains around Virginia Tech offer a lot of outdoor opportunities. You can hike, fish, hunt, enjoy nature photography, pick huckleberries in July, or just sit in the shade of a big mountain basswood. There's lots of great music venues around the college too. Floyd Fest is a popular annual music event in nearby Floyd, Virginia, but all types of music events go on year round., 850270=Most dorms are pretty good, and if you're in ROTC they're getting new dorms in 2015, 174356=Not just a school but an institution that values Ut Prosm- That I May Serve. This institution has taught me the importance of community and being involved with my dreams. The opportunities at Virginia Tech's hands on environment is endless.}",

Health care informatics specialists work in a variety of environments, including hospitals, clinics, healthcare and public health agencies, information technology firms, research institutes, and the insurance industry. The demand for specialists in health care informatics is on the rise. Job security is one positive aspect of a career in health care informatics. While other types of IT jobs are being outsourced, health care informatics specialists continue to hold positions in the U.S. due to the complex nature of the field and the high level of contact required between the informatics specialist and her employer. Physicians and health system administrators want to keep their experts in health care information systems close at hand in case problems or questions arise. Additionally, the push to implement Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in all U.S. medical facilities by 2014 has caused a large number of technology vendors to enter the field of Health Information Management, pushing demand for workers, and consequently salaries, even higher. There are a wide variety of career options in health care informatics. The list below is not exhaustive, but it will give you a broad overview of some of the possible career paths that are available.
