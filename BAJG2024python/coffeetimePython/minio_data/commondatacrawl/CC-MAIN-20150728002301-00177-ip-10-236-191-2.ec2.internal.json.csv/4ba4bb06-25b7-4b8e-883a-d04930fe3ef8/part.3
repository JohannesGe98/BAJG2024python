I look forward to learning more of them, and have already found a few that I will become involved in.', ""Again, SCSU has an earned reputation as a party school. The graduation rate of only about 50% speaks volumes, as does the weekly police reports in the paper. It's a good school with good academic offerings and can be as challenging as you want it to be, and I think it's great for the more academically inclined students, and not so good for the type of students who just feel they should be in college because they've been told they need to, in order to get a job.

I like going to Munsinger Gardens to enjoy the flowers and the peace and quiet. The movie theater in Waite Park is an option when good films are released, and the Paramount theater has some interesting and entertaining offerings throughout the year. There's good shopping all over the place, too. The only thing I've noticed that is lacking in the area is any truly fine dining restaurants. There are plenty of casual dining and overpriced bistro type places, and there are far too many chain restaurants, but no real upscale options at all. Even Antone's isn't really fine dining by my definition, though the prices tell you that they believe they are."", ""SCSU seems to have a pretty good variety both on campus and within a short distance of campus.

I have met a few instructors and professors and all have given me an impression of excited, energetic and involved instructors, which leads to excited, energetic and involved learners. Nothing less than happy successful professors can produce happy and successful graduates."", ""Attend any and all preparation activities and events for new students once you receive your acceptance letter if at all possible. Take a campus tour to familiarize yourself with the area, and make sure you speak to an advisor as soon as possible- even before the advising and registration day- especially if you are a transfer student. Some majors are not offered, though pre-programs may be, so even if your intended major isn't listed, it's worthwhile to look into SCSU as an option since tuition is cheaper than many larger and private universities, and it really doesn't mater where you get your prerequisites finished, as long as they apply to your major. SCSU has a reputation as a party school. The local police are not forgiving nor are full time non-collegiate city residents. The best advice I can give both as a long time resident as well as an older student is that while you are here, you need to stay focused on your education, so you don't end up leaving on probation."", 'SCSU has a small town feel while offering large school experiences and top notch course selections. The campus is geographically compact and easy to learn your way around. Parking anywhere near campus is a nightmare unless you pay the almost prohibitively high fees, opt to ride the city bus which can take an hour just to go three miles, have someone drive you in to class, or ride a bicycle to, from and while on campus.']]",St. Cloud State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/St-Cloud-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/24836,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,70,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00177-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905929003,905861482,HORIZONTAL,"12/29/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 14 out of 16 people found this review useful. 1 of 73 Karen from Spicer, MN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it.

Students who want a great education for low costs should attend here. Students who want to be part of great friendly and easy going environment should attend here.

Have a personal relationship with your advisor - they are there to help you. Use the library, they have great resources for you and the people who work there can help you. Use the writing center, they will help you with your papers. Bang for the buck The cost to attend is reasonable and the quality of the school is amazing for the low costs. The convenience of food is good and the quality. Western also provides many services to help you academically, advisors are there to help step by step.

Personally, I love Western and I wouldn't want to attend college anywhere else. Western Carolina University, is located in Cullowhee. There is nothing in college except for the college, a gas station, a bar, and apartments. We had a few restaurants off campus, but they were burnt down this year unfortunately due to a kitchen fire. They are working on rebuilding the restaurants, and they will be ready by 2016. Outside of Cullowhee, is this town called Sylva. There is a lot of places to eat in town but mostly fast food restaurants. You will find a Walmart, banks, Ingles, Food lion, a bowling alley, a small movie theatre, and small shops. Downtown is kind of fun, if you want to spend the day walking around, going to a coffee shop, and just relaxing. So the question is what to do for fun. You have to make great friends, this will come easy because the school is small. You'll probably go to many bon-fires with your friends, off of campus. You may spend your night by a fire, laying on a hammock, and grilling out. You'll go hiking, and when I say hiking I mean vigorous hiking. A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it.

Fraternities and sororities through parties usually on Thursday through Sunday. Some fraternities have been thrown off campus due to excessive rule breaking or are not affiliated with the college. An example could be Pike.', 'There is a bunch of clubs at this college. They range from interest clubs(like Video Game and Comic Book club) to academic clubs(like Math and Economics club). I am personally in Comic Book, Anime, Fianance and Investment club and I enjoy the meeting a lot. They have great leaders and students in the clubs.', 'Students who like the mountains, like to be outgoing, and want to attend a very small school. Class sizes usually range from 20 to 30 students, but some classes can have up to 70 students.', 'There is a dip in between the resident hall, Madison, and the academic building, Moore. Most people know that there was a murder here about 40 years ago and it has come to speculation recently that it is haunted. On Halloween, people try to see the ghost.', ""There aren't that many people at this school, but the ones there already are very nice people. The football team isn't good at all but the basketball team is great. The school is really hoping to become the next big college in the future. They hope to become this by renovating dorms, building new academic buildings and new dorms."", ""You can go to the Cats Den where there is a bunch of arcade games. You can also hang out with friends by the fountain. Sadly, other then that there isn't much to do. You would have to drive out to Asheville, or Gatlinburg to have a good time. Sylva, the town outside of the college, is where most kids go to hang out."", 'Dining is pretty good at this school. The lunch ladies are very nice and like to see the kids happy. The food can be a disgusting at times though. And some of the food can get to be very repetitive at times. There is a ZOCA(mexican restaurant), a Panda Express(Chinese food), Freshens( ice cream) and a Burger Studio at the bottom of the cafeteria. At the University Center(U.C) there is a papa johns and a Chic-Fil-A.', ""This is what I did not like the most about this college. There are only 13 dorms. The ones freshman usually get into are Scott, Walker, and Buchanan. Scott is ok, but most people in this dorm are people who like to party. Walker's rooms are very small and cramped, and your are required to either bunk the beds or loft the beds. Buchanan rooms are the nicest, but the only problem is that it is a hike away from the rest of campus. My advice would be to live in Scott or Walker because they are right on campus. Buchanan is really far away and at night it gets pretty creepy with how fast it gets dark and how quiet it is."", ""This is a decent college. Very good teachers who care about their students success in college and in life. Sometimes the assignments can be challenging, but sometimes they aren't."", ""Visit the school first, an open house day(on a saturday) would be the best. But it is also good to go on a regular tour when the college is in session. If you live far away from the mountains, you may get homesick easily. Work hard to get in the school. Make friends with classmates. And if you don't like your roommate, then switch. Most teachers are very friendly and approachable. Meet some teachers or try to sit in a class to get the experience."", 'This is a great school with some nice people and great teachers. Some students are mean, but you will occur those at any school.

If you feel unsafe walking to your dorm or car after a long night at the library, campus police will pick you up or walk you to where you need to be.

With clubs ranging from Student Government to Gaming Clubs, Western offers something for every personality. Clubs are a great way to get involved on campus and build your resume.', ""WCU is perfect for involved students who enjoy being outdoors and don't mind a bit of cold weather in the winter."", ""At a little more than $12,000 per year, you couldn't ask for a much better college experience. Textbook rental costs are already included in your tuition along with tutoring for nearly every subject. Students have free access to any home athletic events and the campus recreation center and pool. The on-campus theater costs only $2 per student and offers free popcorn along with recently released motion pictures."", 'Although the campus is located in the mountains, about an hour away from any major city, there is always something to get involved with around campus. Base Camp Cullowhee offers a variety of outdoor adventures for students including kayaking, sky diving, mountain climbing and many more. Popular artists such as Sean Kingston, Relient K and Kacey Musgraves hold concerts on campus a couple times each year. A few games of Humans Vs. Zombies are played on campus throughout each semester. Service and volunteer opportunities are also frequent.', ""Cafeteria food at Western leaves something to be desired at times. It seems that the only time food is truly 'good' is when the campus is expecting visitors such as prospective students. Luckily the school offers a variety of other food options to break up the monotony of cafeteria food. These locations include Panda Express, Freshens, Zoca, Burger Studio, Starbucks, Chic-fil-a, Papa Johns, Einstein's Bagels and many more."", 'Learning to share your room, bathroom, study and kitchen with a number of other people is a challenge that comes with living on campus. Resident Assistants make this transition as painless as possible by helping you adjust and get to know your fellow residents through a number of activities and events in each resident hall.', 'Throughout high school, I was deeply involved in extracurricular activities and I excelled in Honors and AP courses. After graduation, I assumed that I would be well prepared for the rigors of college academics. I soon discovered that I was very incorrect in that assumption. Depending on your major and the number of credit hours you decide to take, academics at WCU can be very challenging for many students. I have found that it takes twice the amount of studying and dedication to do well in my college course work.', ""You shouldn't attend WCU without expecting to walk...a lot. Although the school offers a free, campus-wide shuttle service, the one-way route lacks convenience and isn't always the quickest solution. Involvement on campus and in the local community is very important at Western. You don't want to be the student that spends every non-class hour in their room watching Netflix or playing video games. Get out and get involved."", 'Western Carolina University is perfect for students seeking a small town environment.

The WaLC is a very useful tool that is included in your tuition. Textbooks are also included, and you can simply rent them from the university book store, which definitely saves money and time. The free concerts and inexpensive activities also even out the tuition costs.', ""The staff at WCU are fully aware that the campus is secluded in its valley and they find plenty for students to do. There is always a movie playing in the theater, it's only $2 a person. (But the movies have already been in theaters for a while, so if you want to see the newest blockbuster make plans to go to the theater in town.) There are also concerts held frequently enough that they're annoying, but not so frequently that they're extra annoying. And for the more sophisticated crowd WCU hosts plays all the time. Just recently the theater majors performed The Drowsy Chaperone. It was wonderfully done. And, of course, the biggest draw of Western Carolina is the mountains. There are plenty of places to hike, canoe, kayak, you name it. Many students travel out to view the waterfalls. There is also a fitness center on campus which has a rockwall. (Bet you thought I was going to suggest running on a treadmill for fun.) The rockwall is tall enough to see the whole campus from the top, if you're that brave. So, in short, there is more than enough to do once you finish your term paper."", ""I love the dining hall. There are plenty of things to choose from on a daily basis and they keep everything fresh. (Your favorite dish will be far enough apart on the calendar that you'll never get bored with it.) They also have late night dining at the dining hall Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Even if you don't think you'd use late night dining right now once you get on campus you'll be in love with it. And if you decide you're not feeling the cafeteria scene anymore there are enough options on campus to keep your tastebuds entertained. McAllister's, Chick-fil-A, and Panda Express are just a few of the options offered to students on campus. Dining off campus is also popular and on your visit to WCU if Speedy's pizza is open go there. (It's close to the paper mill, you can't miss it.)"", ""Residential Living at WCU is acceptably helpful. I know many of the RA's and they're great. They are happy to help with any issues you may have and they'll answer any random questions you have but don't know who to talk to. The freshman dorm doesn't have air conditioning but all of the other dorms on campus do. There are laundry machines in the dorms, but they do cost to use. You'll probably meet some of your best friends down your hallway so be friendly and bring a door stop so you can keep your door open."", ""It depends on the major you choose, along with what professors you have. Some are really helpful and don't assign so much work that you can't remember it all. Some of the professors aren't at all helpful and it feels like you're teaching yourself. It's really a matter of how much work you're used to how rigorous it is going to be."", ""Bring an umbrella. (WCU stands for We Carry Umbrellas.) Become friends with your adviser, and don't be afraid to change your schedule if you don't feel comfortable in the classes you are currently enrolled in. Pack your schedule so that you can comfortably drop one or two courses and maintain a full-time student status. Also, put yourself out there and try new things. The university provides so many opportunities for you to get out and adventure, possibly outside of your comfort zone, and you should do it."", 'Western is a beautiful place with plenty for the person that loves outdoors and indoors. The Honors Program is amazing and the professors involved in the program are astoundingly dedicated to helping the students, not leading the students. There are so many student led organizations that it is almost impossible not to find what you are looking for in the University, you just have to put yourself out there and look.']]",Western Carolina University (WCU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Carolina-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118902,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,64,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00177-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906016043,905922563,HORIZONTAL,"07/26/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 35 out of 37 people found this review useful. 1 of 118 Brianna from NC Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There aren't many places you go on campus that there isn't a campus policeman or car close by."", 'One of the things that I really like about Western, is the dedication the staff has at helping you succeed. As a freshman, you have so many councilors, advisors and mentors to help you, not including the professors. You have an orientation councilor, a mentor for the odds and ends, an academic advisor to help you with classes, and everywhere you turn, someone is willing to help you.', ""There are so many things that you can do for fun here. There are many club and intramural sports, diverse organizations (a lot that I had never heard of before), and extra things for people who aren't interested in either, like movie nights outside on the lawn, fairs, and concerts."", ""There are so many food options here at Western.

I practically live with them sometimes and we all have a great time. At first the dorms do not feel like home at all, but within about a month, they become home.', ""So far, my classes haven't been too strenuous but have been enough so that I am learning a lot. You aren't so bogged down with homework that you don't have time for anything else, but the load isn't so light that you aren't busy."", ""If you would like to come to Western, please realize that you are not here to party. I have known a few people that have already been suspended for doing things they shouldn't. You can have fun here, there are plenty of things to do, but learn responsibility so that when you get here, or to any college, you don't associate college with partying."", 'Western is great for getting students involved in clubs, sports and organizations. It is also very supportive of things outside of school life, such as voting, breast cancer awareness and donating blood. Western also has a great staff; every teacher I have had so far has been dedicated to helping you do great in the class, and if for some reason there is a bad teacher, Western is good to replace that teacher with someone who cares.']]",Western Carolina University (WCU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Carolina-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118902,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,69,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00177-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906016043,905922563,HORIZONTAL,"07/26/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 35 out of 37 people found this review useful. 1 of 118 Brianna from NC Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it.

We have had an occasional cell phone theft or assault but it rarely happens. The campus police is always driving around. Maybe could use a little more police after dark when students are walking to their car after a long night of studying. Just helps with making the students feel secure.', 'Western Carolina has a big Greek Life. The problem is that is seems very cliquish. They tend to sit together in the cafe, hang out with one another, take the same classes together, join the same clubs. College is about being open minded and engaging in relationships with people that are different from you. This helps you in the real world and dealing with diversity. College is also a time to look within yourself and find out who you are and what you want to do.', ""There are many different clubs that you can get involved in. Whether it's geared toward your major or simply a hobby there is a club for you. If there isn't one you could always start one! The trouble is finding these clubs and even knowing they exist. You can play a sport, engage in civic activities, enjoy music by your fellow classmates."", 'Students that love the outdoors should come to Western. Students that want like to actively learn and participate in class will enjoy the family feel that is established in the small classroom setting.', 'There is a water fountain in the heart of campus where students can run through during the summer days. A lot of students gather around this and hang out during breaks. During the warmer months students lay out on the lawn with blankets and socialize or study. Some students play music which is nice.', ""Western Carolina is a little less expensive than most schools in North Carolina. I think it's well worth it. The classes are small which is good because you don't feel like just a number. Some of the buildings are older but historic which is cool. They use a rental program for your books which is AWESOME because you don't have to pay a fortune for your books."", 'If you love the outdoors this place is for you! Located in the Great Smoky Mountains there are many activities. Rock climbing, tubing, canoeing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, hiking, fishing, skiing, and biking. The town is very small and quiet. The scenery is gorgeous!', 'There needs to be more dining options especially healthy options. The dining areas seem to be in one part of campus. Another dining hall should be set up closer to the library for those that spend hours there. The Starbucks is a lifesaver but I feel there should be another one closer to the library.', 'Some dorms are nicer than the others but those are the ones that are also more expensive. There are a couple of dorm rooms that need to be updated.', ""The classes I have taken so far push me and make me really think. That's what college is all about. The teachers engage in different teaching techniques that show their passion and their drive."", 'Go to class. Use your resources like the library, your professors, advisor, tutors. Get involved and join a club within your major or just something that you are interested in. Practice good time management make sure that you study a lot but still allow yourself a day to enjoy friends and the gorgeous mountain scenery', ""Western Carolina has a great staff that genuinely cares about your goals.

There is a new health building, and it is incredible! This school is also perfect for couples because it is not a huge party school. If your a couple, you can get your own apartment off of campus and still be able to walk. People will respect that you are a couple, and not try to steal your boyfriend or girlfriend from you.', 'Do not walk under the tower located in the center of campus. They say if you do, then you will not graduate. Also, there are many traditional school songs sung at school events. There are a lot of more traditions, but you will learn those when you get here!', 'This is the best school in North Carolina! Your tuition will not be to expensive and your class sizes will be small. You will have the best experience of your life and it may challenge you to come out of your comfort level.', ""I will tell you the truth and you may either love it or decide that this school is not for you. Personally, I love Western and I wouldn't want to attend college anywhere else. Western Carolina University, is located in Cullowhee. There is nothing in college except for the college, a gas station, a bar, and apartments. We had a few restaurants off campus, but they were burnt down this year unfortunately due to a kitchen fire. They are working on rebuilding the restaurants, and they will be ready by 2016. Outside of Cullowhee, is this town called Sylva. There is a lot of places to eat in town but mostly fast food restaurants. You will find a Walmart, banks, Ingles, Food lion, a bowling alley, a small movie theatre, and small shops. Downtown is kind of fun, if you want to spend the day walking around, going to a coffee shop, and just relaxing. So the question is what to do for fun. You have to make great friends, this will come easy because the school is small. You'll probably go to many bon-fires with your friends, off of campus. You may spend your night by a fire, laying on a hammock, and grilling out. You'll go hiking, and when I say hiking I mean vigorous hiking. A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it. You'll also probably visit places like Cherokee (15 min away) and Gatlinburg (45 min away)."", 'There is a lot to choose from on campus! There is a chickfila, papa johns, a small sushi place that has it prepackaged. There is also a smoothie place, a burger joint, panda express, Einstiens bagel shop, McCalisters. The upstairs dining hall is the best. This is a buffet style dining hall and you will really get your moneys worth. You can eat as much as you want, for a low cost. They are usually always open and also stay open for late night dining on the weekends.', ""I consider the dorm life to be pretty good! There are many dorms just for freshman but most freshman spend their first year in Scott dorm. This dorm does not have AC but it does have a huge fan on the window. This really isn't an issue unless you take summer classes, then you may get hot. Overall, the dorms are small but you have many options. In most dorms, you can choose to have a suite style dorm (this means you only share a bathroom and get your own room!) or you have the option of bunking with someone. Again, the rooms are small so if I were you, I would get a room to yourself. Some of dorms are loud, depending where on campus they are located. The freshman dorms are the loudest, especially on the weekends. A lot of the freshman, go crazy there first year, and overdose in their dorms. Don't be surprised if you see EMS outside your window. Get into the honors college, and stay in the Blue Ridge dorm (I believe that is what it is called). If you do this, its all studious people who actually care about school and are super quiet."", ""This really depends on your major and what you consider hard. Your teachers will have very high standards, that they expect you to meet! Your teachers will not joke about attendance policies and will take it quite seriously. Example, miss three days of class and this is an automatic B (again this depends on your major). I think the classes seem easier because your in a small class. Your teacher has time to speak with you directly in class and answer all of your questions. Your teachers are also always available during office hours and have time to meet with you everyday because they don't have to worry about 3,000 students a day. Take your work seriously though because you can get a high enough GPA and get into the honors college. Lastly, do plan on writing many papers, and spending your evenings in the library. But its okay, there is a Java City to keep you motivated and moving!"", 'If you are going to attend Western Carolina University, then you need to get involved in clubs! There are so many clubs to choose from and you will make friends quickly. Also, do not spend a lot of money on winter gear. Prior to coming to Western Carolina University, my mother spend so much money on winter coats, boots, etc. The winters here are mild and you will only have snow sometimes and the roads will always be cleared. Live on campus your first year, you may hate the freshman college dorms because there is not AC but you will live. You will make life long friends in Scott dorm and become close to great people. Also, eat upstairs in the dining hall! Students tend to not want to eat up here because ordering panda express, or papa johns is easier. At the dining hall, you can eat as much as you would like, and you get your moneys worth. Lastly, if you are a freshman, leave your car at home! There is absolutely terrible parking at western. You probably wont even use your car here, unless you are taking a trip to Walmart. Your friends will most likely have a car and you can car pool.', 'Western Carolina University, the best underrated college in North Carolina. Wake up to beautiful scenery, and walk to class, where your class sizes will be small, you will make the best friends, and enjoy studying by the tower. Western Carolina University is your school, if you enjoy the outdoors, want to be taught by teachers who have PHDS, in a class setting of thirty or less, and you are okay with not living in a city.']]",Western Carolina University (WCU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Carolina-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118902,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,107,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00177-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906016043,905922563,HORIZONTAL,"07/26/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 35 out of 37 people found this review useful. 1 of 118 Brianna from NC Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Going forward, we believe Tata Power is likely to get hit in its operating margins due to the open excess provision. Conversely, Reliance Energy is expected to improve its operating margins by around 2% from the current levels. Though the long-term growth prospects of both the private power majors are good, but in the medium term, it seems that growth has been factored in the current valuations. On the other hand, Reliance Energy has more aggressive plans. The company has planned a 9,000 MW generation capacity by 2012, almost 10 times its current capacity. Talking about green field projects, the management is waiting for the state government's nod to begin its 3,000 MW gas power project in Vidarbh region of Maharashtra.

With this merger, the generation capacity of the company will increase to 1,150 MW. TPC on the other hand, is planning to add another 1,500 MW generation capacity by FY09.

Ce choix a √É¬©t√É¬© fait car j'√É¬©tais tr√É¬©s satisfait des services Paypal depuis plusieurs ann√É¬©es. Le bilan n'est pas fameux. La carte Visa cens√É¬©e √É¬™tre une carte Paypal, et qui n'est en fait qu'une carte Cetelem avec un logo Paypal, s'appuie sur un cr√É¬©dit renouvelable. Je passerai sur les probl√É¬®mes de plafond de cr√É¬©dit qui bloquent les paiements avec la carte bien avant les 3000√¢¬Ç¬¨ mensuels qu'elle est cens√É¬©e permettre. Sachez que Paypal se d√É¬©sint√É¬©resse compl√É¬®tement de la gestion de cette carte. Ils ont pr√É¬™t√É¬© leur image, un point c'est tout. Comme ma r√É¬©pondu le service client Paypal, ""c'est un partenariat, mais c'est une carte Cetelem avec cr√É¬©dit Cetelem"". Donc pour tout probl√É¬®me, passez votre chemin. Ils renvoient vers Cetelem et l√É¬†, commence la partie de ping pong. Pour ce qui est du contrat de fid√É¬©lit√É¬© qui est cens√É¬© rapporter 10√¢¬Ç¬¨ tous les 2000 points, en effet les 2000 points sont bien d√É¬©falqu√É¬©s imm√É¬©diatement, par contre le mail de 10√¢¬Ç¬¨ en bon d'achat lui, n'arrive jamais. A noter que les points de fid√É¬©lit√É¬© n'apparaissent nulle part sur le site de Cetelem. Le seul affichage se trouve sur le site de Paypal mais il n'y a aucun moyen de contr√É¬¥le sur leur calcul. Le service client Paypal est tr√É¬®s rapide √É¬† r√É¬©pondre aux mails en cas de probl√É¬®me, puisqu'il se d√É¬©charge imm√É¬©diatement sur Cetelem. Le service client Cetelem, lui, ne r√É¬®gle jamais les probl√É¬®mes par mail, il pr√É¬©f√É¬®re √É¬©videment qu'on les rappelle sur leur num√É¬©ro surtax√É¬©. Premi√É¬®re r√É¬©ponse t√É¬©l√É¬©phonique du service client Cetelem pour mon probl√É¬®me, ""on ne g√É¬®re pas les points de fid√É¬©lit√É¬© Paypal ""! Suite √É¬† mon insistence, vu que Paypal m'a renvoiy√É¬© vers eux, et comme ils sont incapable de traiter un probl√É¬®me en ligne, ils ont envoy√É¬© une r√É¬©clamation √É¬† un autre service. Maintenant, il faut attendre un hypoth√É¬©tique rappel de leur part. Donc pour l'instant j'attends qu'il daignent m'envoyer les 2 bons d'achat de 10 √¢¬Ç¬¨ qu'ils me doivent.

Differences may arise from returns, bad product, or other sales concessions.', 'Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes.

It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size. Formula: Total Overhead Cash Expense / Net Revenues', 'Operating Profit to Sales OPERATING PROFIT TO SALESOPERATING PROFIT TO SALES is a useful ratio when evaluating value of a firm.

This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management.

Return on assets is an indicator of how profitable a company is. Use this ratio annually to compare a business performance to the industry norms: The higher the ratio the greater the return on assets. However this has to be balanced against such factors as risk, sustainability and reinvestment in the business through development costs.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements. The rule of thumb Current Ratio for small companies is 2:1, indicating the need for a level of safety in the ability to cover unforeseen cash needs from current assets. Current Ratio is best compared to the industry. Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities', 'Quick Ratio QUICK RATIOQUICK RATIO (or Acid Test Ratio) is a more rigorous test than the Current Ratio of short-run solvency, the current ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness.

A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity).
