You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The diversity allows a welcome environment for all. Entering a new place in general, you'll find yourself being more open and conversing with people you might not have during High School. Rutgers really is a great place for all kinds of students."", ""1. Get involved! Not only is it a great way to make friends but it's an opportunity to find activities you enjoy and become a more rounded person. 2. Take Classes you find interesting especially in your first year, before you declare a major. 3. Learn the bus route before your classes start. Trust me it'll save you a lot of frustration! It'll also help to locate the buildings you'll have your classes in beforehand as well. 4. Take advantage of all the learning programs. It may take up time you could use to party but it WILL help in the long run. Some may also give you stipends for textbooks. 5. Wait till you go to a few classes before you buy your textbooks as some professors may not require you to use them. Also it's best to buy your books online(eg. Uloop, Amazon, Ebay) or from previous students rather than at the University bookstore. 6. Take part in the summer programs offered such as Summer Bridge or EOF. You'll be able to make friends before college actually starts and the credits you earn will allow you to take higher level courses in your fall semester."", '3/5 stars because of the expensive housing and out-of-state tuition. Besides that the resources are phenomenal when it comes to availability of information with one of the largest databases and 5 libraries to choose from.', 'ThereÃ¢\x80\x99s always something happening at Rutgers to keep you preoccupied; there are concerts, theatre productions,Ã¢\x80\x99 ice-cream nightsÃ¢\x80\x99, rock climbing, club-held water balloon fights and much more activities youÃ¢\x80\x99ve possibly never heard of. If youÃ¢\x80\x99re a person of the night, youÃ¢\x80\x99re in luck because the fraternities host parties almost every day of the week. The food at Rutgers is a major part of the reason why I gave 5 stars. In the several dining halls, youÃ¢\x80\x99re offered a broad range of food. From sushi to custom omelets to all the baked delicacies you can think of- Rutgers has it all. However, if you ever feel the need for a break from the dining hall food, a variety of restaurants are in walking distance of the campuses. For those like me, who appreciate nature, the suburban campuses flourish during spring and give you a sight to behold during fall. If youÃ¢\x80\x99re lucky, you might be able to see a fox or two as well as other wildlife. The farm on Cook campus allows you to get on an even more personal level with animals.', ""Not only have I learnt a great deal academically, but I've learnt a lot about myself in the process. The majority of the professors are knowledgeable, approachable, patient and always helpful with my studies, especially during their office hours. With the university being large, however, it did prove difficult at times to find the right lecture hall or classrooms: but a quick overview of the Campus maps online as well as a helpful passerby will get you through. The rooms themselves are clean and comfortable: Perhaps too comfortable at times, as one tends to fall asleep. Rutgers offers great diversity and with that IÃ¢\x80\x99ve learnt about people and their various cultures. I wouldnÃ¢\x80\x99t necessarily say every acquaintance IÃ¢\x80\x99ve made was positive, but with every person I met, I at least learnt a new way to approach different situations or to view things in a different light. Being a new resident of New Jersey IÃ¢\x80\x99ve also been given the opportunity to learn about the state itself. The grounds of Rutgers alone hold intriguing history. There are also a number of programs Rutgers offers like AIMS, ODASIS and LSAMP that help you to succeed academically. I gave Rutgers 5 stars in this aspect particularly because of all the opportunities offered for students to succeed.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently.

You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

Tuition ranges nearly around $10,000 which when compared to many other schools, seems to be one of the main factors in why students attend this school. For the many resources provided, such as nearly 5 grand libraries, it seems as if we are allowed to get more than what we paid for. The only downside of Rutgers University is that course books and accessories needed are very expensive. You spend nearly $300-$500 a semester on course texts. However, the tuition is very affordable and according to many other friends, the school provides many scholarships. It also allows many loans to be taken out to pay for schooling because that is one of the most convenient ways to temporarily pay for college. Use the resources provided to its full potential and you will realize that we are getting more than what we paid for. Am enjoying being here Rutgers University is a school in which you are almost guaranteed in finding yourself. With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you. Due to the very high diversity of people including racially, ethnically, and religiously, every single day at Rutgers is",True,0,0,

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you. Due to the very high diversity of people including racially, ethnically, and religiously, every single day at Rutgers is a learning experience about people in general. There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently. You will never feel out of place and that is one of the most important reasons that it is so much fun attending Rutgers University. Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other. Late nights, study sessions, going out, are all things you will mostly do with your building that turns into a memory that will last a lifetime. The only thing I do not really enjoy about Rutgers University is the bus system. Since it is such a big school, the only possible way to move from one campus to the other is on busses. Even though they are frequent, sometimes during rush hour, it takes twice as long returning from one campus to another. Sometimes",True,0,0,

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester.

Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

Am enjoying being here Rutgers New Brunswick has such great campuses. I found it hard to choose which clubs to commit my time to, since there are so many exciting ones out there! I'm currently an officer in two- member of three. :) Though I'm not a partier, there are always parties going on. Seriously. Like every night. So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors. Login to rate or flag the reviews Annie 08/02/2009 Reviewer is A current",True,0,0,

Livingston's Rutgers Zone holds daily events and gives out free Thomas Sweets Ice Cream which if you don't know already is AMAZING."", ""Rutger's food ranges form terrible to delectable depending on which campus you are eating on. My recommendation is to avoid Brower, the College Ave dining hall, at all costs unless you're craving one of their twelve ice cream flavors. Livingston is the best with it's brand new facilities and awesome food selections. Busch is second best but first in the pasta cook to order department. It's delicious and worth the wait. Besides the dining halls there are a bunch of other places to eat in the student centers and around college ave, all of which are good and most of which are cheap. Best part is they all accept RU Express."", ""There are many dorm options at Rutger's such as regular dorms, Suites, Apartments, etc. Each has a different atmosphere but one thing is the same for most dorms, especially freshman ones. Come Thursday night the hallways will be loud, very loud, no matter what time of the year it is. Other than that the dorms range from being terrible, like the Towers on Livingston that don't have air conditioning and feel like an oven, to wonderful like Stonier which is an air-conditioned dorm with bathrooms in every room."", ""Depending on the classes you take the classes can be quite challenging, especially in the sciences. 101 classes aren't as bad and some can be considered an easy A, except for Expos which is very tough, but once you get into your major classes the professors crack down and you must work hard or risk failing."", ""Keep your grades up and don't slack off senior year. While Rutger's has a reputation for being an easy school because it's a state institution their standards are rising every year and if you don't work hard you might not get accepted."", ""Rutgers prides itself on being a diverse community and does a pretty good job of keeping to their word. There are so many opportunities to choose from and people to meet that no two Rutger's experiences are alike but they are all enriching and fun. The one downside to Rutger's is the buses because they are terrible but that is a small price to pay for having so many awesome campus options.""]]",Rutgers University-New Brunswick Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rutgers-University-New-Brunswick/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,83,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00262-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889090975,888881254,HORIZONTAL,"{549877=It can be great, and it can also suck. It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently.

Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other.

Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Tuition ranges nearly around $10,000 which when compared to many other schools, seems to be one of the main factors in why students attend this school. For the many resources provided, such as nearly 5 grand libraries, it seems as if we are allowed to get more than what we paid for. The only downside of Rutgers University is that course books and accessories needed are very expensive. You spend nearly $300-$500 a semester on course texts. However, the tuition is very affordable and according to many other friends, the school provides many scholarships. It also allows many loans to be taken out to pay for schooling because that is one of the most convenient ways to temporarily pay for college. Use the resources provided to its full potential and you will realize that we are getting more than what we paid for. Am enjoying being here Rutgers University is a school in which you are almost guaranteed in finding yourself. With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you.

The campus police aren't always there and though studying late seems like a great idea, you should really consider that when you're heading home after 10pm. There have been many robbery incidents and even shootings at Rutgers, which have to do (sometimes) with the residents of New Brunswick. So think twice about roaming George Street by yourself at night."", 'Greek Life is serious at Rutgers and philanthropy is the name of the game! Though, at times, Rutgers has experienced shutting down a few sororities and fraternities, there is a bevy of different cultural, academic or just fun Greek organizations that diversify your college experience.', 'Rutgers has an amazing amount of student organizations that cater to just about any student and they often acquaint you with other students and possible new friends!', 'Considering the fact that I lived on a dorm, I thought I fared pretty well. However, I was an out-of-state student so tuition was still expensive. In comparison to Ivy League schools and private institutions, you do save a lot for the same quality of education.', ""Rutgers has an amazing nightlife, from house and frat parties to a good selection of bars. Also New Brunswick has three amazing theaters that show musicals and plays. It's like being on Broadway, but for way cheaper. Also the school often has concerts featuring famous artists. I have seen 112, Trey Songz, Common, Ginuwine, NERD, Fabolous, The Roots and even Pitbull while attending Rutgers."", 'As I had mentioned in the dorm life, the food experience is diverse! The best dining halls are Nelson and Busch. The dining halls are offer special events that all the students know and love, including King Neptune Night (Seafood, all day) and MidKnight Breakfast (which is always around finals time!). Off campus food is definitely a high point, Rutgers is infamous for their Fat Sandwiches which could be bought off of a stationary truck that offer all different types of fried goods in one sandwich. The first time I had a fat sandwich was my freshman year and I loved the Fat Mojo, which was chicken fingers, mozzerella sticks, french fries and honey mustard all jammed in between a nice bread roll. Amazing! Also a lot of restaurants on Easton Avenue and George Street offered diverse food selection at affordable prices.', ""Dorm Life is absolutely one of the best experiences I've had at Rutgers. New Brunswick is comprised of 5 different campus, which were once separate institutions of their own, and all of them have a different culture. For the students that love convenience, and prefer being close to the nightlife, College Avenue is your best bet. College Ave has access to all the surrounding campuses and it is basically where the party lives. For the laid back types who appreciate being around nature, then Cook and/or Douglass is for you. The dorms aren't the best, in comparison to the luxury dorms on George Street, but they are pretty spacious and often a variety. Also hands down, the Nelson dining hall is by far the BEST dining hall at Rutgers New Brunswick. Take out is more appetizing and the food selection is vast. The classroom buildings are surrounded by vast grassy lands as you go further into the campus. At the tip, closer to College Avenue, you get more of a small-town feel. These campuses are considered quieter and easier to find a night of silence, especially if you need to study. Livingston used to be the least desirable campus, with the worst dining hall and even worse residence halls. However now Livingston is going through a beautification project that is aimed at attracting more students. Back when, all the campuses were colleges, Livingston was indeed the easiest to get into. Now lastly, Busch is one of the biggest campuses that is far too confusing for me. It was geared towards the science, math or engineering students because all of those departments are usually based on this particular campus. It has a more suburban feel, but the dorms are comfortable. Also the dining hall is ALMOST as good as the one on Douglass/Cook campus."", ""Depending on your major, the rating can be completely different. However, even the simplest classes can challenge you. I don't think there is a class that is deemed an easy A. Every class requires tons of work OUTSIDE of the classroom. If you should have any issues with your assignments, be sure to contact your professor and show that you are more than willing to learn. He or she might boost your grade just by knowing your name."", 'Visit the campus and get a feel for the student life and the academics. Rutgers University, though, it may be a state university can get expensive when you choose to live on campus, so visit the financial aid office often and ask about federal aid options. Also come to the school with an open mind, this campus is filled with tons of people from different backgrounds and have different ideals.', 'Rutgers University is amazing university for an affordable price.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it.

Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time.

It's a really good cause and loads of fun, either participating or watching."", 'There are recreational activities like kendo, ballroom dancing, yoga, tae kwan do, and more. It does cost some money, but it is worth it to do something and to meet new people. The Rutgers Zone is a great place for ice cream, games, and watching sports. Sometimes, there are even film festivals taking place. All it takes is just some looking around and keeping an ear out for this stuff.', ""People will say that Brower Commons (College Ave) is disgusting. To be honest, getting lunch there is not that bad. It can be disgusting with the appearance of the dining hall, but it's manageable. Busch is quite good with the food, especially getting the cooked-to-serve pasta. However, the pasta line can get really long. Livingston, with its new dining hall, is pretty great, especially the pub area where you can order a burger with fries and some other additions on the computers. At Cook/Douglass, you can go spend your meal swipes to get sandwiches and it has pretty good food."", ""Sometimes, the hallways will be loud after quiet hours, especially when people come back from parties. Sometimes, the bathrooms will be a mess or feel uncomfortable. You won't always like the people on your floor. However, the dorms aren't that bad. Like any other place, it just takes time to get used to things. Dorms are honestly the best way to get to know people and find common areas of studies to get help in."", 'Academics will be hard. Pre-calculus is hard unless you really go for help and practice the problems. The sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) are also hard unless you really do the work. Make sure you really develop on time management skills because it really does help with keeping track of classes and allows for better retention on the material being learned.', 'When you take your placement exams, take them seriously as they really do affect what math and English class you receive. Try your best to begin preparing for time management skills for studying, doing homework, and making time for friends. Prepare to get used to large lecture halls with 300+ students, but also try to get to know some. Those people can help you with assignments and in study groups. Like in high school, try to build a relationship with a professor for recommendation letters and for advice for your future.', 'Rutgers is a large university, and honestly, not always the best for everybody as each person is different from one another. However, Rutgers slowly can become a home away from home with new friends and experiences. The campus itself is beautiful, but can be dangerous like every other place in the world.']]",Rutgers University-New Brunswick Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rutgers-University-New-Brunswick/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,99,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00262-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889090975,888881254,HORIZONTAL,"{549877=It can be great, and it can also suck. It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Also, there's going to be a movie theater on Livingston campus so if you want to go watch a movie, there's always that. Also, inside many of the freshmen dorms, there are pool tables, ping pong tables, and foosball tables. There's a lot of things to do on and around Rutgers campuses, it's just what you want to do that makes your college experience."", ""The dining hall on each campus all differ when compared to each other in taste. The new dining hall on Livingston campus is probably the best dining hall that's close to other campuses but the Cook/Douglass dining hall might be the best over all. The worst dining hall is the one on College Avenue, and the one that's not great but it isn't horrible is the dining hall on Busch."", ""Dorm life is extremely fun. Living on campus for freshman year opened up a lot of opportunities and enabled me to have a very large group of friends. Keeping your door open and just saying hi to everybody you see allows you to have a fun time. They'll never let you get bored since there's always something to do and so many people to get to know."", ""The academic rigor isn't too strenuous as long as you can manage your time well and you don't waste your time when it comes to schoolwork. Of course you're going to have to spend time at school doing schoolwork, but you won't spend more time than is necessary as long as you stay on top of your work."", ""Have fun, be yourself, join clubs, and enjoy college, but don't forget to go to class! Don't skip classes, don't procrastinate homework to do something fun with your friends when you know you won't have time later, and always keep in mind your prerequisite classes when registering for classes."", ""Rutgers is one of the best choices I've made in my life. It's fun, energetic, enjoyable, and everything you want it to be. You can do whatever you want and like whenever you want to, just because there's so many things to do on and around campus at all times of the day.""]]",Rutgers University-New Brunswick Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rutgers-University-New-Brunswick/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,101,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00262-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889090975,888881254,HORIZONTAL,"{549877=It can be great, and it can also suck.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Tuition ranges nearly around $10,000 which when compared to many other schools, seems to be one of the main factors in why students attend this school. For the many resources provided, such as nearly 5 grand libraries, it seems as if we are allowed to get more than what we paid for. The only downside of Rutgers University is that course books and accessories needed are very expensive. You spend nearly $300-$500 a semester on course texts. However, the tuition is very affordable and according to many other friends, the school provides many scholarships. It also allows many loans to be taken out to pay for schooling because that is one of the most convenient ways to temporarily pay for college. Use the resources provided to its full potential and you will realize that we are getting more than what we paid for. Am enjoying being here Rutgers University is a school in which you are almost guaranteed in finding yourself.

Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation.

Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

There are crime alerts every week, sent to your email without your subscription and your phone if you subscribe, about someone getting jumped or someone blowing something up. Two of them have involved two of my friends, that's how many have happened. Keep in mind that the campus is located in New Brunswick, and a handful of students come from street life. Not criticizing the streets, I'm familiar with them myself. It's just something to be aware of when you come to this college. On the other hand, I walk around by myself at night, through the woods and all that, and I'm always fine, thank God. It's a big campus and anything can happen, so just be on your toes and don't hang around late at night with people you don't know (common sense stuff, but trust me I know people who forget these little things. it's so true in real life). But you have a higher change of being in risk when you go to a party than when you walk down the street at night though, so keep that in mind as well-- danger is everywhere, so be alert, but don't be paranoid either and you should be fine."", ""More objective opinion: Greek Life is semi-big on campus. Almost all the houses are on College Ave. Greek parties from what I've heard are very difficult to get into. Initiation often involves violent stuff like punching bricks (my friend joined a frat) or playing cruel pranks. Personal opinion: Wouldn't recommend Greek Life. It's enough to join clubs or join a community, Greek Life just seems unnecessary for social life. in fact, most of the people I know in sororities and frats don't really talk to people outside of their circles, which I think defeats the point of any community."", 'So many clubs. So many activities. Have fun choosing which party you want to go to, or which fellowship you want to go to, or which ice cream party/free pizza event you want to go to. There are so many things happening at the same time. You will never have nothing to do.', ""You can be athletic and outgoing or shy and reserved. Cliche, but Rutgers really is for diverse types of people. It's one of those big but rare colleges that have so many little communities in it that change people for life. If you have Jersey pride, you'll like Rutgers."", ""Passion Puddle-- kiss somewhere here and you will get married Rutgers Garden-- it's hidden somewhere near Cook, maybe you will find this secret garden"", ""Same undergraduate education as Ivies, 1/3 the tuition. I know because I talk to people who go to Cornell and Yale, and it's the same thing. It is true that personal attention may be less, but that changes as you progress to upperclassmen classes."", ""There's over 100+ student organizations and there's always a party or campus show or fellowship or movie (like i mentioned before, there's a Livingston movie theater being built right now as I type this in 2012) going on somewhere, anywhere, at any time on all the campuses. Vague, but once you get here, you'll see what I mean. You will not be bored."", ""I'll be really detailed on this one because food is important to a lot of incoming freshmen. The food is good in my opinion, fresh on some nights, like steak and mashed potatoes, chicken marsala. The breads and other kinds of carbs are sometimes dry, but the microwaves and toasters and panini presses will easily fix that by bringing out their original flavors. will satisfy your culinary tastes. It is buffet style. There are stations called Mediterranean Grills which are made-to-order. The staff are friendly, and if they are not, please be nice to them because most students are disrespectful to them. You will find that they will appreciate and reciprocate kindness. I realized I receive significantly larger portions of food simply by smiling at the staff. Overall, the dining hall food is repetitive because you will be there all year round, so depending on your liking towards variety the dining halls may please you or annoy you on some days more than most. The Livingston and Douglass dining halls are the best ones. There are many, many options outside of the dining halls, however, in the New Brunswick area; chinese food, viet, sushi, Mexican, fast food, grills, Dunkin Donuts, etc. You will not starve, ever."", ""The reason I give my dorm life a 4 star has to do with where I live, on Douglass campus, in a first year all girls dorm. Sounds lame, I know, but it's actually really awesome living with girls that become like your sisters. I've polled the majority of my friends as well, who live on Busch, Livingston, and College Ave. The dorms are all clean and moderately new, but I would avoid College Ave, I never hear anything positive about that campus' dorms. Dorm life varies depending on your preference for silence or noise, but when you are accepted to Rutgers, you can easily choose those options when selecting a roommate. Dorm life for freshmen often consist of something called floor meetings, which you will be required to attend, but they're generally quick, about 15 minutes, and cover basic information like academics, floor rules, and events that will be happening near where you live, so it's useful to attend as well. My advice about dorm life, if you want it to be the best, is simply to leave your door open or stop by other people's dorms to say hi. It isn't as intimidating as it sounds, it's actually very simple and allows you to get to know other people. Also, the Livingston Campus is almost done with their newly build apartments, plaza, and movie theater, so if you live on Livi you will be in the center of a new hotspot as well."", ""I give this a 3-star because I want you to weigh 3 things: Level of difficulty- 3 out of 5, as in moderate; you can take that well or badly depending on how easy you like your classes to be. Level of cohesiveness- 3 out of 5; the way that the professors teach often does not flow, but comes in chunks of information that you are meant to dissect on your own. Level of integrity- 2 out of 5. People here cheat, especially in the business school. But more than that is the fact that people here do not have a very sharp desire to actually LEARN. At least, that's what it seems like in the business school; that they just want to get As or Cs depending on their agendas and get out of here as fast as possible. That has a toll on the academic culture here."", 'If you are a Jersey student considering Rutgers for its cheap value, then your consideration is wise. This is the New Jersey school for decent academic opportunities at a low cost, especially if you are an undergraduate student seeking to enroll in the sciences, business, or any research/technical field of study. I would not choose this school if money or proximity is not an issue for you, and you value the prestigious Ivy names out there. Undergrad $ saver = Rutgers. If you consider Rutgers your dream school, please weigh carefully the academic pros and cons of coming here before you imagine something that is beyond the reality. There are definite cons to coming to such a large school, like the bureacracy of how things are done during registration or trying to get some time with advisors. Do not expect personal attention from the faculty here, it is not common. Just know that as far as undergraduate degrees go, Rutgers really is a top value as rated by many publisher. Make sure that you get APs or college-level credits in, especially if you are from NJ. They generally count towards your undergraduate study, so that you can save 1-3 semesters of tuition based on how many AP or college-level credits you can get approved. Make sure your guidance counselor informs you on how to contact the advisors at Rutgers, because the credits will be impeccable to you once you arrive here and realize that you could have saved semesters by cracking down on those AP credits.', 'Rutgers is undoubtedly the hotspot of diversity, where local and international students congregate together in one school, making social life a booming culture. Academics vary depending on the professors that you come in contact with, most are generally more focused on their research, which can be good for their knowledge in teaching, but bad for their personal attention to students. Football and drinking is the mainstream, academics is just a fish in the stream (meaning social life takes precedence over academics)']]",Rutgers University-New Brunswick Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rutgers-University-New-Brunswick/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,108,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00262-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889090975,888881254,HORIZONTAL,"{549877=It can be great, and it can also suck.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They even have meal plan options for students that live off campus and even commuters."", ""Residence Life at Rutgers is probably my favorite part of my college experience. I just got hired as a resident assistant so I know from experience that they go out their way to make sure students have a great time. They plan many different programs which always include free food and are always fun. They do strongly enforce the policies which include drug and alcohol policy, however it is for everyone's safety. Overall, I feel that dorm life at Rutgers is a great experience!"", 'Rutgers is a challenging university so you will have to attend all classes, do required readings, and study hard throughout the semester and not just before the exams. Classes are usually larger, with up to a couple hundred students per class, therefore you have to make sure you pay attention to the syllabus and have a planner to keep tract of due dates. Professors will usually remind you of due dates the day before a paper or assignment is due, if they decide to remind you at all.', 'Most classes are lectures, which means you will have to force yourself to go to class. Make sure that you actually go because it will make all the difference in your final grade. Also, make connections with the professors they are very approachable and most of them truly enjoy the subject they are teaching. They love talking to students about the material, helping prepare for exams, and their research projects. Once you make these connections they are more than willing to write letters of recommendation for you. Going up to them can definitely be intimidating, but step out of your comfort zone and do it because it will help you in the end.', 'Rutgers is a very diverse campus with tons of different things to do.

May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Am enjoying being here Rutgers New Brunswick has such great campuses. I found it hard to choose which clubs to commit my time to, since there are so many exciting ones out there! I'm currently an officer in two- member of three. :) Though I'm not a partier, there are always parties going on. Seriously. Like every night. So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors. Login to rate or flag the reviews Annie 08/02/2009 Reviewer is A current",True,0,0,

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors.

There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently. You will never feel out of place and that is one of the most important reasons that it is so much fun attending Rutgers University. Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other. Late nights, study sessions, going out, are all things you will mostly do with your building that turns into a memory that will last a lifetime. The only thing I do not really enjoy about Rutgers University is the bus system. Since it is such a big school, the only possible way to move from one campus to the other is on busses.

If you live on campus you have to have a meal plan. First years should have a 210 or higher meal plan, others should have 105 or higher meal plan (Numbers represents the number of meals you can have). Try to choose 210, because if you miss any meal swipes they don't pass it to the next semester. Also not everyday you are going to go to dining halls. There are also cook to order pasta and omlet. There are healthy options but most of them are hidden, it is up to you to find and eat them.

Dining halls are also not far away from housing.', 'Science and engineering courses in Rutgers are very rigorous. You need to pay attention and understand the concepts. You can still pass the course without understanding concepts but advanced courses assume that you already have the idea so they go very quickly. Upper Level engineering courses have project and presentations. Arts and humanities courses are not very hard but still you have to study.', 'Apply for scholarships very early, since this is a state university applying early makes you be in the front of the race.

Get to know your professors and TAs early on they will be a great asset if you use them from the beginning.', 'Very diverse environment with different kind of people.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

New Brunswick is home to many bars, restaurants, shops and even the state theater to keep the large student body occupied. The Busch Campus contains the football stadium where a majority of the students attend to watch the Scarlet Knights play in the fall while the Livingston Campus houses the Athletic Center, which is packed during basketball games in the winter. Additionally, the College Ave. campus is the center for most student run activities, such as concerts, club meetings, events and most importantly, parties.', 'The dining halls at Rutgers are very straightforward. There is one hall that is brand new, accompanied with different stations based on cuisines and is unanimously rated with the best food offerings. The other 3 dining halls are not as new or have as much selection, but still are more than satisfactory when unable to make it to the brand new hall.', ""The dorm life at Rutgers University is based on a lottery system and could mean staying at a brand new dorm building one year and switching to some of the oldest dorms on campus the next. Luckily, the upperclassman do receive priority so dorm life often gets better. The newest dorms and apartment buildings are among the nicest, as they are filled with brand new technologies and modern furnishings. Unfortunately, if one's lottery number is too high, they may be stuck to stay at the older dorm buildings which seems to only contain the bare minimum amenities."", 'If students wish to truly be challenged at Rutgers University, they can undoubtedly be. The Honors programs provided in most majors can be brutal and expectations are always high. The classes will indeed keep you busy and as you progress, the work will only get harder. If the honors program seems like something one would like to take part in, I would advise to stay in the honors housing for at least one year. The moral and academic support given out from like-minded students only helps you to succeed in the difficult classes.', 'Many freshman and transfers are overwhelmed by the large student body combined with the 4 distinct campus spread around New Brunswick. Yet, they must realize that all the upperclassmen were in the very same position as well and actually enjoy helping others sort out their schedule and find the right classroom. It is also important to know that no matter the size of your class, the professor and the Teaching Assistants are invaluable resources to receiving a excellent grade in the class and that no individual should be afraid to approach them. Additionally, prospective students should take advantage of the many services, clubs and opportunities a large state school, such as Rutgers, offers.', 'Rutgers University is an extremely rewarding and enjoyable school to attend. It is a school that excellently mixes the partying and fun side of college with strict and demanding academics.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

In fact, the campus holds three police stations, one being unaffiliated from the city of New Brunswick. There is the Rutgers University Police, Piscataway Police, and the New Brunswick Police. Also, unfortunately if a crime does happen to occur, every Rutgers student is sent an email called a Crime Alert detailing the crime that took place, as well as methods to prevent a similar situation from happening to you.', ""An unusual, but highly popular tradition that is also a location on the New Brunswick campus is the 'Fat Sandwich.' The fat sandwich is a scrumptious sandwich that is a staple of Rutgers University. In fact, the Fat Darrel, one of the many sandwiches offered at the famous Greece Trucks was named the number one sandwich in the country! Even if you are not able to become a student at the university in its entirety, I highly recommend stopping by to pick up one of these delicious treats that are also a bang for your buck, pricing at $5.50."", ""Fun is a very large component that makes up the definition of Rutgers University in my opinion. Rutgers' campus contains approximately fifty thousand students in total, and there is at least one thing that every student on campus can find enjoyable from working out and swimming at the Werblin Recreation center to walking the streets of the high paced, brightly lit Easton Avenue. Also, Rutgers has an astounding number of 300 student organizations, and the best part of all is that if a student happens to not find anything suitable for them, they are more than welcome to invent their own club!"", 'Food and dining is a fun and exciting experience on the campus of Rutgers University. There are a total of four dining halls- that in itself says a lot about the dining experience. Most food in the dining halls is custom made to order, and Rutgers does extremely well in maintaining its dining facilities to always make sure that they are always clean and a pleasant spot for students to eat or just sit down and relax after a long day of classes. The food is quite exceptional. There are foods from various cultures, and everyday there is something new.', 'Dorm life at Rutgers is one of my favorite qualities about this institution of higher learning. Dorm life is always bright, joyful, and displays an atmosphere of dedicated students as well as outgoing and young teens. Dorm life at Rutgers is guaranteed to be in itself a life time experience where you will meet friends that you will have for the rest of your life.', ""Rutgers University is a very academically rigorous school. Since Rutgers admits only the best and brightest amongst its campus', professors accept nothing less than high quality performance in the classroom."", ""Tips for prospective students are virtually unlimited, however, there are a few key factors that can help in determining the success rate of one's college career. Number one, always manage your time. Without efficient time management skills, as a student, you will constantly feel overwhelmed and stress, and that is not what the college experience is about. Learn how to balance all of your extra curricular activities and academics. Number two, be accepting of things that you're not accustomed to. College isn't just about learning academically. It also involves learning about the world around you and the people in it. Therefore, make friends from different backgrounds then yours, and you will learn more about the world without knowingly doing so. Finally, always be determined and motivated. Without these two qualities, it will be impossible for one to be successful in a productive college atmosphere."", 'Rutgers University is a superb institution of higher learning.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Their Pharmacy, Engineering, as well as Business schools are widely acclaimed and their challenging programs drastically prepare you for life beyond college. Nearly every class at school is demanding in order for the student to attain the most knowledge and experience they can but it all comes down to the student. Teachers and Professors are available for extra help beyond classroom time in case one needs additional tutoring. However, if the student does not take the class seriously, then they will miss out on many important lessons both academic as well as life. I found it difficult to adjust in the beginning because I thought classes will be as easy as they were in high school, but I quickly learned that I was very wrong. That is why I labeled it as four stars, the missing star is not the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s fault- but rather, it is mine. It is mine because I was the one who slacked off in the beginning but I cannot put any of the blame on the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum. The classes are very doable but the student needs to put in their one hundred percent.

It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Because it is a public university, the public has access to many of its buildings and resources, and so you are never really secluded from the real world. Do not be alarmed, Rutgers has an excellent police force and all campuses are well lit at night. The key is to never travel alone late at night and to always watch out for yourself, as you should anywhere. You can always call RUPD for a ride home!', ""Greek life has a firm stand at Rutgers, but not an overwhelming one. There's a large amount of fraternities and sororities available to get involved with, including honors chapters, business chapters, and LGBTQ chapters. Those who do not wish to be involved with Greek life will not feel influenced in the slightest by those who do or by their activities."", ""Rutgers has a huge amount of clubs. Discovering these clubs can be difficult at first, but attending fairs held each semesters allows exposure to organizations like the Academic Bowl team, the Rutgers Equestrian Team, Boardgame Club, Astronomy Club, and more. If a student cannot find a club to join, it's easy to make your own!"", ""Rutgers is great for one type of student specifically: ANY student. Rutgers is really a place for everyone and anyone, you will always find your niche at the university. It would be hard not to, it's one of the most diverse universities in the country!"", 'The Rutgers Grease Trucks are a fun, albeit fattening, dining tradition for students. Many a late night is made better when biting into a delicious sandwich containing everything-fried imaginable.', ""If Rutgers is anything, it's a good deal. Internationally renowned, Rutgers provides an Ivy-League education for the public school price with top-notch programs and professors. Students at all levels are able to conduct research with a professor or receive money for research on their own. Also, Rutgers is centrally located, giving you access to places like Philadelphia, New York City, and the Jersey Shore."", ""Fun is defined differently by certain people: some find partying fun, some like sports, and some like music. Rutgers offers an exorbitant amount of things to do; if you think there's nothing to do, you're wrong. Go to a concert at a basement show or at the Mason Gross School of Arts, explore the shops and restaurants on Easton Ave and George Street, go to the gym with friends or play a game of frisbee. Now going to the movies on campus is even possible, with special movie screenings in campus centers and the newly built Livingston Movie Theatre, playing first-run movies on three screens!"", ""With the new Livingston Dining Hall, Rutgers dining experience just leveled up. All four campuses have a dining hall, with the best being Livingston, followed by Cook/Douglass, Busch, and College Ave. Most often the food is great, but sometimes it can be disappointing, as anyplace will be. Don't worry, you'll never go hungry. Along with dining halls Rutgers New Brunswick offers PLENTY of options in their campus centers as well as the many places off-campus in New Brunswick and Highland Park (and many places deliver for FREE!)."", ""Rutgers dorm life heavily depends on chance.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people.

It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester.

With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you.

There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently. You will never feel out of place and that is one of the most important reasons that it is so much fun attending Rutgers University. Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other. Late nights, study sessions, going out, are all things you will mostly do with your building that turns into a memory that will last a lifetime. The only thing I do not really enjoy about Rutgers University is the bus system. Since it is such a big school, the only possible way to move from one campus to the other is on busses.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Their Pharmacy, Engineering, as well as Business schools are widely acclaimed and their challenging programs drastically prepare you for life beyond college. Nearly every class at school is demanding in order for the student to attain the most knowledge and experience they can but it all comes down to the student. Teachers and Professors are available for extra help beyond classroom time in case one needs additional tutoring. However, if the student does not take the class seriously, then they will miss out on many important lessons both academic as well as life. I found it difficult to adjust in the beginning because I thought classes will be as easy as they were in high school, but I quickly learned that I was very wrong. That is why I labeled it as four stars, the missing star is not the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s fault- but rather, it is mine. It is mine because I was the one who slacked off in the beginning but I cannot put any of the blame on the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum. The classes are very doable but the student needs to put in their one hundred percent.

The price for in-state students, especially commuters is probably the lowest for a four-year school.

It's easy to find financial aid. The price is definitely worth it."", ""The Daily Targum will keep you informed on tons of events, and something is bound to peak your interest.

Each dining hall is beautiful and different, and there's one on each campus, so if you get tired of yours, you can try the food on another. As far as prices for meal plans, it's kind of a rip off. It comes to about $14 per meal (or so I've been told), and that money goes to waste if you don't use all of your meal swipes by the end of the semester. While the variety within the dining halls is fantastic, there is little to no variety at takeout. The system is efficient and convenient, but it's pretty much the same food every week, the quality is not always good (the takeout pizza tastes like cardboard while the dining hall pizza tastes delicious), and the meals are not necessarily balanced or healthy."", ""Freshmen tend to get stuck with the worst dorms, but after freshman year, dorm choices are done by a lottery.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing.

The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

Am enjoying being here Rutgers New Brunswick has such great campuses. I found it hard to choose which clubs to commit my time to, since there are so many exciting ones out there! I'm currently an officer in two- member of three. :) Though I'm not a partier, there are always parties going on. Seriously. Like every night. So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though!

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Freshman can only go as low as 210 meals a semester, so USE YOUR MEAL SWIPES. Try not to eat out as much and spend unnecessary dollars. But if you want to splurge a bit, there's may eateries that have punch card programs where you get a free meal/drink after buying 10 meals/drinks.

But if you want to make good use of your meal swipes, the dining halls are a good option! Livingston is the newest dining hall, and by far the best! Busch and Cook/Douglass are a close second. All have a healthy variety of food options! Many people don't like Brower because their food is of lesser quality and it's true that they have less options than other dining halls. Plus, Brower is a VERY large and spread out room. But I think it's okay!"", ""Some people have great dorm experiences, others have terrible dorm experiences. There's 2 factors for this: what you make of your environment and the people around you AND your environment and the people around you (this includes roommates too!). In general, if you're friendly and sincere, you'll have a pretty good dorm experience. Sometimes though, the people in your dorm will be unbearably annoying or just, unbearable! If you really hate your dorm, you can move out. On a side note, there's always RA run dorm activities, so that depends on if your RA takes their job seriously and tries to foster and improve dorm life by hosting activities."", ""Difficulty levels vary depending on if you're in the honors program or not, what school you get into (what your major is), which professors you have, and what classes you take. The honors program (I'm not in it) is very rigorous I'm sure, but the regular track is pretty demanding as well. There is no such thing as easy. It also depends on what your major is. Pharmacy majors have a much more rigorous curriculum than literature or communications majors. Choose your major wisely, and be prepared to work extremely hard to reach your goals if need be! And finally, rigor depends on which class you're taking. General Biology is way harder than Comparative Literature, so be mindful of that. Also, professors run their classes differently than other professors, so be aware of that as well."", ""After you begin the enrollment process, begin looking at the requirements and course track for your school, major etc. See what kinds of classes you have to take or have to option of taking if you're working on fulfilling requirements. Afterwards, read up on course descriptions, professor syllabi, textbooks needed, and student reviews on courses and professors. My tip is BUY TEXTBOOKS EARLY, aka, get em while they're cheap. Get a sense of which classes you're not going to drop out of and then buy the textbooks for those classes. Get them way before the fall semester begins, at least 1 to 2 months before. (Same goes for the spring semester, buy books during winter break). This will save you a lot of money!"", ""Rutgers New-Brunswick is a unique school for a liberal arts education because its general education requirements aren't subject areas, they're skills.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It is mine because I was the one who slacked off in the beginning but I cannot put any of the blame on the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment.

With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950.

Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I'm currently an officer in two- member of three. :) Though I'm not a partier, there are always parties going on. Seriously. Like every night. So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors.

Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment.

You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass.

It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit!

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Their Pharmacy, Engineering, as well as Business schools are widely acclaimed and their challenging programs drastically prepare you for life beyond college. Nearly every class at school is demanding in order for the student to attain the most knowledge and experience they can but it all comes down to the student. Teachers and Professors are available for extra help beyond classroom time in case one needs additional tutoring. However, if the student does not take the class seriously, then they will miss out on many important lessons both academic as well as life. I found it difficult to adjust in the beginning because I thought classes will be as easy as they were in high school, but I quickly learned that I was very wrong. That is why I labeled it as four stars, the missing star is not the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s fault- but rather, it is mine. It is mine because I was the one who slacked off in the beginning but I cannot put any of the blame on the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum. The classes are very doable but the student needs to put in their one hundred percent. It is better to have a demanding school than an easy and lenient one because it will better prepare you for the future and make you into a",True,0,0,

I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all.

Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well.

In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time.

Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors. Login to rate or flag the reviews Annie 08/02/2009 Reviewer is A current student",True,0,0,

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You could go to the movies, or the mall. A couple of weeks go my friend and I went to the State Theatre to see Tracy Morgan perform, which was a lot of fun.', ""For anyone planning to attend Rutgers, my best advice would be to bring snacks for those nights that you don't wanna go out to the dining halls and get food. Also, the Cafes at each campus also accept meal plans as a form of payment so you don't have to pay out of pocket. On College Ave., for those days you don't want anything from the Dining Hall of the cafe, there are a lot of great eating spots to go to for a good price (ex. Qdoba, Chipotle). As for meal swipes, make sure you know how much you're going to be eating. If you're not a big eater, don't assume that you're going to eat three meals a day and get the largest meal plan. I'm usually lucky if I have time to sit down and eat breakfast once a week."", ""I think I got lucky because I decided to room with one of my friends from high school. Although our friendship didn't guarantee that we'd be good roommates, were on the same page most of the time. We don't have to ask each other to take out the trash or vacuum or clean the fridge, we just know it needs to be done and share the responsibility equally. The dorm room itself is ok once you put your stuff in it and liven it up. All in all, I'm pretty content with my dorm accommodations."", ""As a Pre-Med major, the classes that I take are very demanding. General Biology is a very good course though, but I don't care much for Calculus I. Expository Writing is ok as long as you're not afraid to go to your teacher's office hours and get their input. Also, make sure not to go to college with the high school mindset. You're not going to pass the final cramming the night before. Take a little time out of each day to study for your class, maybe spend a Saturday or Sunday reviewing with a friend, and go to your teacher to clarify, and you're golden!"", ""Learn the bus routes before you start classes.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center.

So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great.

I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you. Due to the very high diversity of people including racially, ethnically, and religiously, every single day at Rutgers is a learning experience about people in general. There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently. You will never feel out of place and that is one of the most important reasons that it is so much fun attending Rutgers University. Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other. Late nights, study sessions, going out, are all things you will mostly do with your building that turns into a memory that will last a lifetime. The only thing I do not really enjoy about Rutgers University is the bus system. Since it is such a big school, the only possible way to move from one campus to the other is on busses. Even though they are frequent, sometimes during rush hour, it takes twice as long returning from one campus to another. Sometimes",True,0,0,

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

The Grease Trucks offer students sandwiches with an entire fast food meal (fries, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, etc.) on a roll. The Homecoming Bed Races- groups of students get together and decorate rolling beds however they want. Then one night, they all race down College Avenue and get judged on creativity. And any football game being spent in the student section is a must have experience.', ""Especially for in-state students, the amount you take away from Rutgers with the tuition you pay can't be beat."", ""Rutgers is a train ride away from several major cities, making it possible to go to NYC or Philly for a day trip. Closer to school, downtown New Brunswick offers restaurants, shops, theaters etc. On campus, there is always some club offering an event. There's always something happening."", 'Each campus has a dining hall plus other chain restaurants. The dining hall has good quality and variety of food each day, but it can get tiring after weeks of what seems to be a cycle of food where the same meals are served on certain days each week. There are a lot of restaurants in the area that accept RU express a preloaded card with credit a student can put onto their card. There is great variety of food throughout the campuses.', 'The varied campuses allow for different dorming options available to every type of person. There are dorms, apartments, suites etc. The first year dorms tend to be very social and are a great way of meeting one another. Some dorm facilities are nicer than others but overall the quality of dorm life on campus is quite enjoyable.', 'Rutgers professors have great backgrounds in the fields and are very knowledgeable. Rutgers is not a joke school. The people who come out of Rutgers are some of the most successful in the world. The curriculum is not impossible, but you will certainly be challenged in your courses. Rutgers has so many majors that it is possible to pick up a few classes in almost any field imaginable. Your courses are tailored to your interests.', ""Especially in state, Rutgers is often viewed in a negative light. But to out of state students, acceptance into Rutgers is comparable to acceptance into the highest ranked universities in the country. Don't let other people make you feel like Rutgers isn't good enough. You'll receive more for your money than you think. Don't be afraid to get involved. It's a great way to meet people of all types and make many friends. Many first-year classes have lectures of hundreds of students. Don't feel like you are being drowned out.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though!

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do.

With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year.

Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them.

Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950.

It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€?

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€?

Their Pharmacy, Engineering, as well as Business schools are widely acclaimed and their challenging programs drastically prepare you for life beyond college. Nearly every class at school is demanding in order for the student to attain the most knowledge and experience they can but it all comes down to the student. Teachers and Professors are available for extra help beyond classroom time in case one needs additional tutoring. However, if the student does not take the class seriously, then they will miss out on many important lessons both academic as well as life. I found it difficult to adjust in the beginning because I thought classes will be as easy as they were in high school, but I quickly learned that I was very wrong. That is why I labeled it as four stars, the missing star is not the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s fault- but rather, it is mine. It is mine because I was the one who slacked off in the beginning but I cannot put any of the blame on the schoolÃ¢Â€Â™s curriculum. The classes are very doable but the student needs to put in their one hundred percent.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Am enjoying being here Rutgers New Brunswick has such great campuses. I found it hard to choose which clubs to commit my time to, since there are so many exciting ones out there! I'm currently an officer in two- member of three. :) Though I'm not a partier, there are always parties going on. Seriously. Like every night. So if you're into that scene, you'll definitely love it here. Everyone's open-minded and fun; it's great. Am learning a lot Every professor I've had is brilliant, engaging, and motivating. 3/4 teachers I had for my art foundation classes have been graduate students, though, and they're more hit-or-miss than real professors. Lots of times I got the feeling that they don't really care about helping us develop and improve our artwork, and they're just teaching to get the visual arts practice credits. Don't worry, though! After the foundations year it's all seasoned artists for professors. Login to rate or flag the reviews Annie 08/02/2009 Reviewer is A",True,0,0,

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school.

It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester!

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework.

Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car!

Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester.

Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries.

However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things).

The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food.

They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€?

With such a large school and vast population, you will find numerous people that are like you and even more students that are very different from you. Due to the very high diversity of people including racially, ethnically, and religiously, every single day at Rutgers is a learning experience about people in general. There are so many different people that it amazes me how everyone can cooperate to make such a big school run efficiently. You will never feel out of place and that is one of the most important reasons that it is so much fun attending Rutgers University. Also, those that are living on campus will experience an even greater form of entertainment because you will gain an irrevocable bond with many of the people in your building that are dissimilar from each other. Late nights, study sessions, going out, are all things you will mostly do with your building that turns into a memory that will last a lifetime. The only thing I do not really enjoy about Rutgers University is the bus system. Since it is such a big school, the only possible way to move from one campus to the other is on busses.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends.

You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience.

Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting.

You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

A Rutgers education is already highly respected by employers and graduate schools, but it's your job to find the things which stand out at Rutgers that make it worth it to YOU. I gave 3 stars because naturally I'd love to be paying less, but in reality I do feel like it will be worth it."", ""If you like sports, you have big Division 1 Football games. Basketball games are great too! If you like theater, you have productions by The Livingston Theater Company and Cabaret Theater. There's an on-campus movie theater! There's also a geology museum and The Zimmerli Art Museum. There's campus events and special guest speakers very often. Dorm life is fun to begin with (my floormates and I had movie marathons until 3 in the morning). And yes, there's a good party scene. You're also 45 minutes from Six Flags Great Adventure. There's many other things and Rutgers is what you make of it."", ""Not gonna lie all the food is GREAT in your first 2-3 weeks because it's all you can eat, it's different, and honestly it is good.

You get a totally different and even better college experience if you participate in a club or activity with people who share a similar interest. 2) As soon as you get your syllabus, create a study schedule and MAKE TIME for your academics. At Rutgers when you fall behind work-wise it's difficult to recover. 3) Go to all campus events like sports games, plays, concerts, fundraisers, cultural days, etc... Do NOT be one of those people who sits in their dorm room all day. 4) Definitely have a general idea of what you want to major in. Don't be undecided for too long."", ""Rutgers University is everything you could want in a college.

It really depends on who you are living with, and where. Regular dorms are somewhat small, but the apartments that we have are really, really great, there even adding more for Fall Semester 2012., 528428=There are so many activities going around in campus. You can take part in any socities and organizations. There are numerous intramural sports, all campuses have big gyms with many equipment and swimming pools. Downtown New Brunswick has many restaurants and shops that you can visit. New York City is just 40 minutes away. Train ride from New Brunswick to NYC is a great experience. Cook-Douglas campus has natural scenaries and farms with pigs, cows, horses etc. If you are a nature lover you can go there and volunteer their. There will be so many charity events 9/11 memorial charity, charity bed race, dance marathon, big chill (A marathon in December first week), Rutgers Day etc., 1111635=Piscataway relatively safe compared to New Brunswick. Fall 2012 we averaged a crime alert every 1-2 weeks for minor assault or theft. Nonetheless the campus is safe, but just watch your back and travel in groups., 217627=At first I did not want to go to Rutgers because of its proximity from my home (2 hours), I wanted to go to University of Louisville in Kentucky. However, due to some changes, I changed my mind and went to Rutgers. I am so happy with my my choice. For prospective students living in New Jersey in South jersey or North Jersey, this institution is approximately in the middle so you do not have to fear your parents coming up so often or not at all. Rutgers has a lot to offer, it has the courses and it has the activities. The fun does not stop there. They offer a range of living arrangement from city like to rural. College Ave: you have to admit the party campus. I am not a drinker but definitely a dancer. There are some nice parties. If you are not a partier, there are MANY things you can do. I usually plan shopping trips (Cliquers). There is a wide range of shopping areas in Downtown New Brunswick and you will surely find a place you like. College Ave is a city environment. Cook Douglass is the rural-like campus. I love it here though because of the scenery and peacefulness of it. You are bound to have classes on this campus unless you could do some magical trick to change it. Despite the negativity, I love cook douglass. With your meal swipes, you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Campus Center. Livingston: is a campus. Quieter than Busch and College Ave but a little livelier than Cook Douglass. I love it here. I live here for my freshman year. All the underclassman activities are definately found on Livingston. In addition to that, there is a new student center. They are going to finish the new dining hall by the fall of 2011. By the Fall of 2012 or Spring, they will have new apartments and shopping districts. In conclusion Livingston is growing. HOWEVER YOU WILL NEED FANS!!! A LOT Busch: the science campus. The biggest campus I believe. Many students actually shoot for Busch because they believe its the best. However, where you live and how much fun you have depends on how you make it fun. You meet new people every where you go. I recommend visiting the campuses and asking current student if you can check out the rooms because there ARE differences for each campuses. You do not need a car! Besides the fact that you have to pay a permit fee, you have the buses. They are easy to use at times hard to handle during busy times. However, if you know when classes end or begin, getting on a bus with a guaranteed seat is not difficult., 215986=You pay around 22000 a year (not including financial aid deduction or other things). When you stop being a freshman, you will get a choice of doubles, apartments, suites, off campus etc. they make a difference on your tuition. Where you live has an impact on your money. Credits has an impact on your money, the meal plan has an impact on your money. Meal Plans: You get a set 510 required as a first year. The dining hall isn't great (not home cooked delicious) but it is edible. Tillett dining hall on Livingston is actually switching to Busch (The supposed good food dining hall) and Cook Douglass (my opinion awesome place) style food. Brower has the worst food. (I spoke with the chef so I know my infos are valid minus the self opinion). DCC (douglass campus center has 3 times where you can swipe. breakfast. Limited Lunches and dinner. They are great for clearing out the meal swipes because you will have left over swipes. they will go to waste so USE THEM! The rock cafe in the Livingston Student Center is also good for swipes. The Sbarros after 4:30pm in LSC uses swipes too. Sorry Dunkin Donut does not take swipes :( Besides that, you do get free tickets to football games or any other games. Go to them. They are fun. they are something to do. They are a great way to meet people. The buses are hell though (pardon the language)., 775837=I am starting Rutger's in September., 112220=Rutgers is definitely a great value school. It has so much to offer at such a small price, in-state running around $12,600 and out-of-state around $24,500, but they are relatively generous with their financial aid, and almost no one pays the full tuition. Its also really nice that they are a state school because not only do they have a large endowment, but they receive aid from the state on top of that. Rutgers has a great brand name, meaning that other learning institutions and employers respect its reputation. People recognize the name, and they know and trust that people with a degree from Rutgers have learned well. There are rankings to prove it: in 2010 Rutgers Business School Ã¢Â€Â“ Newark and New Brunswick's undergraduate program was ranked #3 by The Wall Street Journal for producing the best graduates according to recruiters in a new ranking The Top 25 Recruiter Picks.Ã¢Â€? In all, for the price paid, the opportunities and experiences are well worth every single penny., 772553=Definitely work on your SAT scores when applying to this school because non-need based financial aid is extremely difficult to get if you don't have at least a 1950. But, to actually get into the school SAT scores shouldn't usually be a problem(for certain schools). It really matters for the business, engineering, and pharmacy school., 963019=Do not under estimate Rutgers. May students apply here as a safe school and think it will be easy, but it is not, Rutgers is a very challenging University and many students learn that the hard way., 332055=at commencement the breaking of clay pipes over the class of 1877 cannon monument takes place to symbolize the breaking of ties with the college. the school is steeped in tradition since it is one of first nine colleges founded in the united states., 9670=-Go to class, even though it's so easy to skip. -Pay attention in class. I would suggest NOT bringing a laptop to take notes, because every single person I've ever seen using one is always goofing off. It's too tempting. And studies have shown that doodling improves information recall! http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/doodlerecall/ http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882127,00.html -Study! You DON'T need to check Facebook at this very moment, you DON'T need to go hang out with friends. Something I learned the hard way is that you CAN say 'sorry, not tonight' to your friends. It's hard, but nothing should come between you and your studies. -Read for pleasure. Take a speed-reading course if you're not confident in your reading ability. You'll do a lot of reading, even in the visual arts program, and stronger skills will help you so much in both the short and long term. -DON'T PLEDGE during your first semester! Watching some of my peers go through pledging was nightmarish- they never slept, became depressed, and their grades dropped. Nothing is wrong with waiting until second semester, or even sophomore year., 777375=This will be my first year come this September., 737591=We have four dining halls, so you are not stuck with one choice. I would recommend Livingston Dining hall they have a Burger Bar! Also take-out is included in your meal plan and runs until 12:00 for thous late night classes or study sessions., 271752=Definitely do well on your SATs, because a score of 1950 opens up more scholarship opportunities and honors classes for incoming students. Also, make sure you study and do all of your homework. I know it's common sense, but a lot of people do not realize how different college really is from high school, so be sure to stay on top of everything. Most professors will not offer extra credit! Also, when dealing with financial aid or student employment DEFINITELY stay on top of it all. Opportunities are always there but are usually nabbed up within the first few weeks of the semester. If you have an issue with anything related to aid or whatnot, be sure to handle it right away., 30561=Students have an exciting opportunity to live and explore each of the five campuses (Busch, Livingston, College Ave, Cook, and Douglass). Outside of class, students can socialize with peers and friends in the campus dining halls at any time. Although the food courts get crowded during school days, the food is great and is paid through meal swipes or RU Express. In New Brunswick, the Rutgers bus system is very efficient, arriving every 10 minutes to stops in each campus during weekdays and runs to accommodate students in the weekends as well. Often, the buses get overcrowded during days of severe weather. Students can get free tickets to Rutgers football and basketball games and be part of the Scarlet Fever. In the spring semester, Rutgers Day (April 25th) is an auspicious day which is celebrated in each of the five campuses. Along with students, parents and relatives visit and tour on the campus and engage in many outdoor activities on that day. Rutgersfest is a thrilling event, where concerts take place, there is free food, and a great chance to make new friends. For on-campus housing, students get free wireless internet access in their dormitories/apartments as well as in comfortable study lounges and working areas in libraries. Recreational centers are open in each campus for students to stay in reasonable shape with an in-door pool, basketball courts, and weight rooms.}",,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 42 out of 45 people found this review useful. 1 of 348 Lawrenceville, NJ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

In her spare time, she was a painter, reader, skater, and singer in the Ascension Episcopal Church choir. She met Charles S. Hayden (b. 1870, Baltimore), possibly at the Shakespeare Club which both attended. After CharlesÃ¢Â€Â™ graduation from law school and acceptance to the bar, the two married on September 1, 1893. They moved to Mosher Street, and their first child, Ruth, was born in 1895. In around 1901, the family moved to Windermere Ave. in Waverly, where two more children were born: Catherine Spencer Hayden in 1902 and Anna (Nan) Bradford Hayden in 1905.

In 1906, the family moved to a home called Ã¢Â€ÂœNancy's FancyÃ¢Â€? on nine or ten acres in Catonsville near Mt. de Sales Academy. This land and house, along with family and friends, were the focus of Emily's photographic work for the next 40 years. The thirteen room house was built in 1732 by the Davis family. The house was torn down in 1970 to build the Christian Temple Church.

Aunque no existe un lÃƒÂ­mite definido en cuanto al nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces que deberÃƒÂ­a incluir en una pÃƒÂ¡gina, es mejor limitar el nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces a 200 por pÃƒÂ¡gina. Los enlaces pasan valor de una pÃƒÂ¡gina a otra, pero la cantidad o el valor que se puede pasar se divide entre todos los enlaces en una pÃƒÂ¡gina. Esto significa que la adiciÃƒÂ³n de enlaces innecesarios diluirÃƒÂ¡ el valor potencial atribuido a los demÃƒÂ¡s enlaces. Utilizar el atributo Nofollow impide que los vÃƒÂ­nculos transmitan valor a otras pÃƒÂ¡ginas, pero es interesante observar que estos enlaces siempre se aÃƒÂ±aden a la ecuaciÃƒÂ³n en el momento de calcular el valor que se pasa a travÃƒÂ©s de cada enlace. Por lo tanto, enlaces con el atributo Nofollow tambiÃƒÂ©n pueden diluir el PageRank. 50 Enlaces rotos",False,-1,0,
