The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that,",True,0,0,

Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff.

Overall VERY safe though sometimes the police can be a bit excessive with parking and bike tickets, also skating is illegal on campus. But that is the price we pay for safety.', ""I am not really much of a party-goer, but there is still a great party scene here at Poly, despite what UCSB kids tell you. There is probably at-least 1 concert or rave to go to every other week that are either hosted at the downtown 18+ club, or at Avila Beach (a mere 15 minute drive away) Cal Poly usually provides safe rides to these events as well (either for free or very cheap, I am not certain). There aren't any night-clubs that I know of in the area though I'm sure if you searched hard enough you might find a couple, especially at Pismo Beach. But with all the houses and frat's just a small walk off campus, there is always something to do at night for all you party enthusiasts."", 'Outdoorsy, Scientific, Creative, Fun Loving.', ""There is a Wall located downtown called the Gum Wall, where everyone chews a stick of gum and places it on the wall. Every inch of that wall is filled with gum, its pretty cool, just don't touch!"", ""Many say that Cal Poly gives a U.C. quality education for the state school price. Which is true for the most part. Cal Poly is cheaper than the U.C.'s now especially with their own tuition hikes, but Cal Poly has been having tuition hikes of their own. With overall costs that might be raising several thousand dollars; but with all the funding cuts I say they are doing what they can; and Cal Poly is really one of the cheapest places around(if you're a California resident) now to get a good education."", 'In terms of extracurricular activities, Cal Poly excels, great for outdoor enthusiasts with Pismo Beach just 15 minutes away, hiking aplenty, Intramural and Club sports, and other fun activities in San Luis Obispo like Paintball and Canoeing. The orientation program called week of welcome, or WOW for short is one of the best in the nation and will help you get to know the school and the town. And there is so much fun to be had with all the people you will meet in your dorm.', ""We all know that the on campus food isn't going to be great. Now that we all have that realistic expectation, lets look at it from a more comparative perspective than an overall rating. If you compare the on campus food at Cal Poly to any good restaurant, it's going to lose. But once you know how much better it is than other colleges, how much more variety we have, you realize it isnt that bad. The location nearest to the dorms, VG's, and Metro, the all you can eat buffet, are horrible and match what you would expect from college food, but other locations such as sandwich factory, Einsteins bagels, and the on campus grocery stores really do make up for it and are great alternative options, though unfortunately they are further from the dorms, which is why VG's is still so popular even though their food is terrible."", 'Dorm life was way different than I thought it would be, but also way more fun. I lived in Yosemite, which is considered to be one of the more social dorms, but there was a lot of variety in terms of the people that lived here. No matter what your interests are, there should be someone who shares the same ones, for me it was Longboarding, there are always plenty of people who are down to party, or play some video games, or go to the beach. Great way to meet people and definitely an essential for your first year of college,', ""I am going to be entering sophomore year this upcoming quarter so I can only vouch for entry level classes. Overall I am working a lot less than I first believed that I would be. It really has to do with your academic habits though. I worked my butt off in high school, always did all the homework that was assigned to me, and was very self-motivated; so the transition to college wasn't too hard; and too be honest I seem to be working just as hard as my friends going to community college and our local safety State school ( they're taking school very seriously so I'm not saying you can slack at Cal Poly) Overall I believe if you but in a decent effort you can get B's without overworking yourself and leaving yourself a good amount of time to socialize and just have fun. ( the 25-35 hours a week motto is completely"", ""Engineering is a hard major to get into, I myself am a Chemistry major but I know a great many people, many of whom are much smarter than me, that didn't get into the Engineering program at Cal Poly. If you really want to be an engineer by all means list it as your first choice of major, just list something else as your second choice just in case. Obviously A high GPA and a high standardized testing score are a must, if you didn't do too well on the SAT, give the ACT a try. I personally did a lot better on the ACT, primarily because has slightly more focus on math and science than the SAT but also because the structure of the test allowed me to move a lot faster through material."", 'A great school academically, especially for Science and Engineering students, all of which is emphasized around the Learn by Doing motto.

To be perfectly honest I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t initially thrilled to be going to Cal Poly, but my familyÃ¢Â€Â™s financial situation made the ultimate decision for me. Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of. The town leans towards the quaint and quiet side, but it is without a doubt a college dominated area. Cal Poly does a beautiful job of welcoming new students to the campus and the town. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s overall a homey environment, while offering the education of a UC without the cost. Away from school, I find most of my time to be spent at the beach or downtown. Pismo, Avila, and Morrow Bay are all within 15 minutes, and all have adorable towns to spend the day in. The downtown area of SLO is even within walking distance, although bus transportation is free for all students. SLO is piled high with restaurants fit for students with everything from Thai cuisine to Italian to renown barbeque. I must throw in one last source of entertainment as it is one of the most talked of events on campus--Thursday night line dancing.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff.

"[['Categories', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', ""Cal Poly has a host of things to do. While the surrounding town is certainly a little more quiet than your average college town, there is plenty to do with in your radius. On campus, there is the Theater where notable people often come through to perform. I know Jerry Seinfeld will be here in a few weeks to perform a comedy routine and there are several other plays and symphonies lined up to perform. There is an a capella group called Take it SLO who performs that is truly phenomenal. Cal Poly is nestled between a range of peaks that are very climbable, one being the P right behind the Red Brick dorms that is about a 20 minute hike. There is also the Architecture Graveyard and Bishops peak, which is further off campus. There are plenty of sporting events always going on, too. Soccer is probably the most notable at Cal Poly, particularly the Cal Poly UCSB rivalry. Cal Poly has a new and extensive rec center that is incredibly gorgeous. They have basketball courts, volleyball courts, racquet ball, swimming, work out equipment, a plethora of classes you can take ranging from yoga to zumba, as well as intramural teams for plenty of the aforementioned sports. Off campus, there is downtown where there is the Farmer's Market every Thursday night. There are also bike parties the first Thursday night of every month after the Farmer's Market. Downtown there is the Fremont movie theater, plenty of great restaurants to suit any palate, and some fun sweet shoppes like Powell's, Rocket Fizz, and Batch. A little farther from campus, there is also a drive in theater and The Grad, which is a club where you can go line dancing every Thursday night, a pretty big deal around San Luis Obispo. There certainly is always something to do, you just have to find some friends and make a plan."", ""Unfortunately, Campus dining is truly the only blemish in my mind on Cal Poly's reputation. Despite it having a thriving Agriculture Department, the few things that the Ag school makes available for sale are expensive and often not worth it on a college budget. All first year students are required to have a meal plan which entails a certain number of meals per week along with a certain number of plus dollars per quarter. Meals can be used at a few select locations while the plus dollars can be used anywhere. The food tends to be good the first week around WOW week as well as around parent weekend but aside from that, it is very mediocre. Healthy options are hard to find, aside from the a la carte fruit and veggie options which tend to be relatively expensive. I was already vegetarian prior to starting Cal Poly but many of my friends have stated that when we go to Metro 19, the all you can eat buffet, most tend to avoid the meat because they feel it can't be trusted. I have not known of anyone to get sick from it but most just prefer not to have it. I have been tempted to confront someone about trying to skip the meal plan for one or two of the remaining quarters I have as a freshman but the truth is that it is inconveniently easy to just walk across the street from my dorm to go and buy food. If i were to buy my own groceries and cook my own food right now, it would certainly be a bigger time investment. Overall, Cal Poly's food is far from the best but it is tolerable for the first year and will certainly make you appreciate your parent's home cooking when you get to visit home. Don't let it scare you away from applying to this wonderful school though, because you really can make the best of it. By the way, Einstein's the better known bagel shop, is also on campus and is included in the meal plan - certainly a saving grace."", 'I am so grateful that I live on campus and furthermore, live in a triple. This may sound crazy because when I was first applying for housing, I wanted a triple but was very uncertain as to how it would work out. However, it has been a pleasure to room with two other guys. One suggestion I would make is to expect to live in a triple if you live in the Red Bricks or Towers, since Cal Poly has been accepting more applicants over the past few years. If you choose to live in either of these buildings (instead of Cerro Vista or Poly Canyon Village) try to control the situation and see if you can meet people to live with prior to move in day. You can pick roommates before hand and while it is not foolproof, it can definitely make the experience a little less scary. I was fortunate to be able to roommate with one friend from high school as well as another individual who I had talked to through a Cal Poly forum and we have all hit it off quite well. Dont be scared if you get random roommates either though because some of my best friends now have live together and had never met each other prior to move in day. The key is to be positive and ready for anything. There is value in every one you will meet.', 'Cal Poly is no doubt different that your high school experience. The classes will challenge you academically but personally too. They challenge you academically by setting reasonably high expectations for you to succeed but they also often expect you to complete the homework and assignments at your desire. They want to see that the students take advantage of the supplemental work to aid their own knowledge but have the trust that one will use if if they need it. This is certainly a challenge to some people but those who take it and complete what is given even if there is no accompanied point value, always tend to do the best.', 'If you plan on attending Cal Poly, I highly suggest that you consider living in the Red Brick dorms. These dorms directly apply to your major (most of the time) and tend to have a much more academic basis. Now you may think that that lends itself to being boring but that is not at all the case. The Red Brick dorms allow you to meet SO many people, often in your major or in related majors. This helps you make friends that are learning the same things you are which is a big help when it comes to studying and doing group projects. As an architect major, Sequoia, the Red Brick that I live in, has drafting tables to specifically accommodate our needs. This little extra touch has been a huge component in my academic success.', 'Cal Poly is a quaint community of dedicated individuals ready to work hard but play hard too. The academics compare to any other institution in rigor and quality. Likewise, the school has plenty going on to get students involved, you just have to look for it!']]",Cal Poly Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Cal-Poly/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/109235,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,111,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00035-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,912069763,911913273,HORIZONTAL,"{179338=There are many activities you can do.

It's easy to find one that suits you or sounds fascinating enough to try out. Personally, I was told to try blues dancing by an older friend who had joined the club the year before. It didn't really seem like my style, but I went to a few lessons. In addition to the lessons, there is social dancing, where people dance with one another and have fun showing off their moves. It was a blast! Joining the blues dancing club completely changed my experience here and led me to meet some absolutely amazing people. Take a chance with the clubs on campus!"", ""There's a lot to do for fun! There's a bowling alley right on campus in the University Union, as well as several hiking trails not far from campus. Hiking is definitely one of the most popular things to do; San Luis Obispo has absolutely beautiful hills and generally nice weather. There are also many different clubs on campus, many of them recreational. If you're not a club person, it's not hard to find a few friends and go into town to go shopping or see a movie!"", ""Campus food is campus food. There are two parts of the freshman meal plans: meals (a set amount of money that you can use to buy food; the amount changes depending on the meal) and plu$ dollars (which act like actual money). Of the places on campus, only three take meals, but everywhere else takes plu$ dollars, including the Subway and library cafe. The three places that take meals, people generally like one or two of them but avoid the third, depending on preference. I'd say it averages out; some campus food is decent, some is more on the sketchy side. There are some obvious vegetarian options, but vegans may be limited to a lot of salad. The Campus Market has many grocery items that are conveniently on campus, but it is more difficult to cook if you're living in the dorms."", ""I personally like the dorm life! It was tricky getting used to sharing a room at first, but after a few weeks, it's easy to fall into certain routines that work with both you and your roommates. Most of the people I've met in the dorms are kind, funny people who have become my good friends. There are obviously a few downsides to living in a dorm (such as working especially hard to not get sick), but it's overall a good place to begin your freshman year."", 'Cal Poly is great in that it balances pushing yourself and learning in new, different ways but not overwhelming its students. The quarter system allows for us to take a variety of classes and disencourages bad procrastination habits.

To be perfectly honest I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t initially thrilled to be going to Cal Poly, but my familyÃ¢Â€Â™s financial situation made the ultimate decision for me. Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of. The town leans towards the quaint and quiet side, but it is without a doubt a college dominated area. Cal Poly does a beautiful job of welcoming new students to the campus and the town. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s overall a homey environment, while offering the education of a UC without the cost. Away from school, I find most of my time to be spent at the beach or downtown. Pismo, Avila, and Morrow Bay are all within 15 minutes, and all have adorable towns to spend the day in. The downtown area of SLO is even within walking distance, although bus transportation is free for all students. SLO is piled high with restaurants fit for students with everything from Thai cuisine to Italian to renown barbeque. I must throw in one last source of entertainment as it is one of the most talked of events on campus--Thursday night line dancing.

To be perfectly honest I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t initially thrilled to be going to Cal Poly, but my familyÃ¢Â€Â™s financial situation made the ultimate decision for me. Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of. The town leans towards the quaint and quiet side, but it is without a doubt a college dominated area. Cal Poly does a beautiful job of welcoming new students to the campus and the town. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s overall a homey environment, while offering the education of a UC without the cost. Away from school, I find most of my time to be spent at the beach or downtown. Pismo, Avila, and Morrow Bay are all within 15 minutes, and all have adorable towns to spend the day in. The downtown area of SLO is even within walking distance, although bus transportation is free for all students. SLO is piled high with restaurants fit for students with everything from Thai cuisine to Italian to renown barbeque. I must throw in one last source of entertainment as it is one of the most talked of events on campus--Thursday night line dancing.

The only reason why it's tolerated is because they are open until 2 AM on the weekdays, so it makes the perfect place to grab a quick bite should you have the munchies or drunchies. Subway is open 24 hours, but it's a long way away. Metro is an all you can eat buffet and the food has gotten better. but it's still not that great. Just be smart about your purchases. Don't waste all your free plus dollars on Jamba Juice or Subway like my friend did."", ""I quit enjoyed it. The main thing you have to do is put yourself out there. Don't be afraid to hurt others by the things you say. As long as you own up to them and talk about it afterward, it's fine. Keeping to yourself for fear of rejection will only do you bad. Take it from someone who has been there. When bad stuff happens to you or your family, you're going to need a friend or two to talk to. You can be an introvert and find time by yourself or in small groups wonderful, but make close friends. Your other friends might be busy facing their own problems in their universities or at work."", ""Quite manageable if you set your mind to it.

Go on the calpoly.edu website and research, in depth, the different majors and minors offered at the university. Very important to note: you will hear that it is impossible to change your major here at Cal Poly. The first thing to know about this is that you CAN indeed change majors and it is easies to change from an impacted major, to a less impacted major. Impacted refers to the majors that have the most student applicants. If your focus in your undergraduate years is to attain a lot of theoretical knowledge in hopes of getting into a good grad school, then a UC school is more your thing. On the other hand, if you focus is to attain practical skills in the classroom that will prepare you for a good job upon graduation, then Cal Poly is one of the best choices."", ""Cal Poly is the best school for you if you know exactly what you want to study upon entering college. Diversity is not Cal Poly's strong suit, so do not apply if you are particularly looking for a heterogenous student body.

Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it.

There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff.

It is top three in the nation for undergraduate engineering, all for around $8,000 a year in tuition! It is also one of the best schools for architecture and any agricultural major. Tons of financial aid is also available, so cost is not as big of an issue at Cal Poly!', ""There is so much to at Cal Poly. Halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco and a little over an hour away from Santa Barbara, there are plenty of places to travel to! Locally, there is a beautiful downtown area, along with the beach, hiking, surfing, kayaking, rock climbing, pretty much anything you can think of! There is line dancing at the Graduate every Thursday, and plenty of places to shop and eat! Make sure to try Firestone Grill! San Luis Obispo is also famous for the Farmer's Market every Thursday night. It features locally grown produce and is definitely worth a visit!"", ""Honestly, dining is marginal at Cal Poly. It is overpriced and of an okay quality. Being in the apartments, I only had to use 8 meals per week, but dorm kids eat there all the time. The meal plan food isn't the best, but it's tolerable. Don't let that keep you from coming to a great school! We do have Starbucks, Subway, Jamba Juice, and Einstein's Bagels!"", ""I lived in the Cerro Vista apartments my freshman year. The positives of this include having your own room, which is nice if you're a bit of an introvert (like myself), only sharing a bathroom with one other person, as opposed to ten or twenty people, and having a kitchen (cooking, yay!); however, it is extremely easy to fall behind in keeping the apartment clean, even with a weekly cleaning service. There are no dishwashers! Basically, a bit of independence is key in order to maintain a nice apartment lifestyle. For the actual dorms, I had many friends that lived there, and I've heard both good and bad stories. All in all, try to make things work with your roommate, and surround yourself with people you love! It will make your dorm experience much more memorable. Also, Cal Poly is planning to build new freshman dorms, so they will be much nicer soon!"", ""The amazing thing about Cal Poly is that you start your major right away. So, many kids think that those are the main classes, and that general ed courses are of less importance. It depends on the class, but any class can catch you off guard if you let it. It's easy to let a GE class slip while focusing on your major classes because those are the important ones. Keep up on your studies! The library is a great place to study. College classes can be a big change, and Cal Poly's curriculum is definitely rigorous, especially if you're in an engineering, math, architecture, or science major."", ""Study, study, STUDY!! It's very easy to fall behind in your freshman year. Cal Poly has a ton of great resources to help you out, but you have to go to them first. Also, don't let the state school registration system scare you. Fight for the classes you want! Also, participate in WOW! Take advantage of every opportunity that you can!

Space is extremely limited though, so you either better get there early, or go at a time when no one is around, because the spots fill up quick. Everywhere else is average, in terms of seating, and you can always find a place to eat. Whether its the buffet venue, or Chick-Fil-A, you will always have worthy options. And if you get bored, then you can easily walk downtown and grab something there. Simple."", ""Dorm life is a super social part of campus life, and they really make sure NO ONE is left out. And I mean, NO ONE. If you are an introvert, good luck, since you probably won't survive all the socializing they encourage (and almost force). For everyone else it's great, because you get good hookups on where the hottest party will be, or get to create a party yourself with the people in your dorm. The advisors also throw some pretty sweet events and contests, so it's pretty much a win-win if you are into that. But if you are an introvert as I am, then I highly recommend the apartment life. It is almost too easy to avoid all the events put on by the advisors, and you can really just focus on whatever you need. You have your own room, and you don't have to worry about being bothered by anyone. It is a complete fortress if solitude just for you, just as it should be."", ""Study, study, study. The campus can't get over how much you need to study. There are literally posters everywhere on campus to encourage and remind you how much you should be studying. Grades are VERY important at Cal Poly. Though you are allowed to go out and party, you better keep those grades up or they WILL hunt you down and find out what's going down. In worst case scenarios, you will be put on academic probation, which is your final warning before being expelled. Cal Poly don't play. You gotta work."", ""Definitely sign up for WOW (Week Of Welcome). It is one of the BEST orientation programs you can find anywhere, and there will be no regrets unless you don't sign up! People meet so many future friends for life there, and it never ceases to be amazing each year. Everyone talks about it for the first few weeks anyway, so why miss out?"", ""Cal Poly has an excellent atmosphere for new students, and for students continuing on. There is always something new and fun to try out, and the food options appeal to the health nuts as well as those just looking for a greasy burger. Location is also pretty awesome, (in the middle of a valley, and only a couple miles from the beach), with horses roaming on campus.

To be perfectly honest I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t initially thrilled to be going to Cal Poly, but my familyÃ¢Â€Â™s financial situation made the ultimate decision for me. Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more. With each class having around 4500 students, I find the school to be large enough as to be able to have your own identity, yet small enough to have a familial feeling about it. Classes are also well sized, especially for smaller majors like liberal arts. All of my teachers have come to know me personally, and I felt as though I had a respected voice in class. There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of. The town leans towards the quaint and quiet side, but it is without a doubt a college dominated area. Cal Poly does a beautiful job of welcoming new students to the campus and the town. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s overall a homey environment, while offering the education of a UC without the cost. Away from school, I find most of my time to be spent at the beach or downtown. Pismo, Avila, and Morrow Bay are all within 15 minutes, and all have adorable towns to spend the day in. The downtown area of SLO is even within walking distance, although bus transportation is free for all students. SLO is piled high with restaurants fit for students with everything from Thai cuisine to Italian to renown barbeque. I must throw in one last source of entertainment as it is one of the most talked of events on campus--Thursday night line dancing.

Cal Poly has proven to be everything I wanted and more.

There is a general feeling of acceptance and comfort that flows throughout campus, and it is an incredible community to be a part of.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two.

Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff.

My suggestion is to study ahead of time for two reasons, one you will be prepared, and two you can spend the extra time you now have playing with fluffy animals in the library.', 'Tuition is expensive, but not in comparison to many other colleges that offer what Cal Poly does. Many of my friends that attended other colleges are hoping to get access to labs in senior year, the same caliber of labs I was given access to on the first day of school. You also can play as much as you work. ASI is always putting on events to help students socialize and relieve stress.', 'There is always something to do. You can hang out with friends, go to the gym, rock climb, swim, bike. If you can come up with it, I am sure you can make it happen with the help of ASI.', ""The food here is overall great. Those that get bored of it, either only eat at one of the venues over and over, or get the same thing every time. Variety is your choice and yours alone. The reason why this is not five stars as of course it can't beat food from home."", 'Dorm life is a blast. Everyone is very friendly, which works out well seeing as housing is packed. You will make friends whether you look for them or not. The saying is that there is no such thing as personal space in college is very true here, but not in a bad way.', ""Classes by themselves are manageable, but add in adjusting to living alone and trying to have a social life, and they can become too much. Focus on school first and the rest will fall into place. Don't let the work pile up because you never know what spontaneous assignment might come up. Always remember to check your classes the night before you have them to help stay on top of the work load. If you get one thing from this whole review, do not procrastinate and classes will go just fine."", 'This school is perfect for anyone looking for hands on training in their field of study. Starting day one, the staff will try to stuff lab access down your throat to allow you to try out what you learn in lecture and lab. The motto is literally Learn by doing. This takes on a whole new meaning as a student in which almost every lecture is tied to lab. A word of advise is to stay on top of the deadlines, both with the application and school work. They pile up fast and the last thing you want to do during your transition into college is to overwhelm yourself unnecessarily.', 'Cal Poly is a wonderful place to grow and learn.

There are many hiking trails right next to the campus which you can hike, run, or mountain bike. These trails can last for a few miles or more then 13 miles. Also, there are many mountains around SLO that are easy, yet beautiful to hike. Downtown can be fun to go to, especially during the Farmers Market. You can see many people you know down there and also pick up some fresh produce. Also, you can see the what the small businesses of SLO have to offer, catch a movie, get some coffee (or tea) and eat some great food. If you (or a friend) have a car, you can head out to one of the many beaches or hiking trails nearby. There are endless possibilities to do around SLO. Lastly, join a club you are interested in.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff. Plus we have student projects you can take for units that further your Major interest!

Cal Poly has their own University Police Department on campus, so if a student feels unsafe and calls 911, it will be immediately directed to campus police. There is also an escort van that starts from 7pm and picks up students from three central locations on campus and takes them anywhere within a mile of campus. There are blue safety poles all around campus that students can press if they feel unsafe, so campus police can locate where the student is and come help them.', '16% of Cal Poly students are affiliated in Greek Life. There are two rush sessions for both fraternities and sororities.', 'Cal Poly resides smack in the middle of San Francisco and Los Angeles, so it is very convenient to make trips to both Norcal and Socal. There are ten beaches all ten to fifteen minutes away from campus, there are a lot of hiking trails all around campus, and the weather that is always above seventy degrees make students exploring nature and even studying outside out on Dexter Lawn.', ""The dining commons definitely need improvement. The food is edible; however, the dining options lack variety, which makes it difficult to have a healthy appetite throughout the school year. For example, because I ate spaghetti so often at school, I never want to spaghetti back at home. It is disappointing that our dining commons aren't delicious because the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental Sciences produces phenomenal products that are sold at the Campus Market, but not in the dining commons."", ""Dorm life is something you should do once, but never want to do again. It's a great way to transition into college after living at home for most or all of your life. You get to live with other students your age who are also transitioning into a life where they are not living with parents and/or guardians. You also learn to be appreciative of your living space, regardless of how small it is and how many people you have to share it with. Also, because you end up sharing space with multiple people, it gives you a chance to take part in taking care of your space, such as cleaning."", ""Cal Poly is academically rigorous, but in a way where students feel challenged and engaged all the time. With the upside curriculum, students get to start with major classes from day one, as they sprinkle in their GE's throughout their four years. The pace of the quarter system also prepares students for the work force, and it gives them the chance to take three quarters worth of classes."", ""Prospective students who are hands on learners should definitely consider attending Cal Poly if they are accepted. Cal Poly gives you prior experience and knowledge in their prospective career throughout the four years they are in college, which on average, results in 6-12 months less training in the work force. The pace of the quarter system that includes actually hands on experience also prepares students for the fast pace that the work force requires. Students also get to step their feet into what they are potentially interested in from day one of college and have plenty of time to switch majors if their decided major is not their best fit. Cal Poly is a great place to get involved and dive deep into other interests. There are over 300 clubs on campus, and it makes college more fun when you're involved in something outside of your major."", ""Cal Poly is the pre-step into the real world, it gives you four years to dive into a potential career interest. The beauty of Cal Poly is that you don't just read about what you might be doing after you graduate, but you get to have hands on experiences in classrooms, as well as opportunities within internships and jobs during your college experience.

The great thing about this school is starting from freshmen year you jump right into your Major courses instead of having to go through only GE's for your first year or two. Here, you start learning about your interest in the first year! As a Pre-Vet and Animal Science Major, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes it's a challenge on a Trimester system, but you learn so much more than any other college because of that, and the professors know their stuff. Plus we have student projects you can take for units that further your Major interest!

The school offers many selections from pizza, to sandwiches, to fresh fruits and vegetables. The cafeteria is a good medium size not to large to small. Watching what you eat is also an extreme.

It is a buffet style breakfast, lunch and dinner and there are also a food place called hawks nest that serve food during late night hours as well if you get that craving.', ""Dorm life is one of the most exciting things that any college can offer. I am a currently a freshman at umes and I stay within a dorm. Dorm life can really encourage you to get connected with other people. It may seem scary at 1st but after a week or so you could make friends with you even knowing it. There are also activities,meetings, games and much more. A dorm isn't for you to just sleep and study its to get connected as well."", 'Academic is the most important role while attending the college. The courses are offered of which your level is on.

It is vital to learn how to take advantage of your time."", 'Attending Umes is one of the best decisions of my life.

EVER!', 'In my opinion, the wonderful and individual treatment that I received from the staff at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore makes the out-of-state tuition more worthwhile. It is very expensive to attend a graduate program out of state, but I know that I will receive a quality education and I also have the personal support of the faculty as well as my classmates.', 'While I have not yet lived in the city of Princess Anne, I understand that it is relatively close to the coast.

At the University level, it is imperative for students to develop self-discipline and appropriate study habits. Not only is tuition far too expensive for the student to be slacking in their studies, but also at this education level students are preparing for professional careers and possibly for future educational pathways. This is the ideal time to develop proper habits for their personal and professional lives.', 'For all prospective students at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), I would highly recommend a campus visit. If you know what area you are interested in studying, or if you may still be on the fence, meet with the advising staff. UMES has exceptional advising staff, and they are very student-oriented. They put the needs of the students at a top priority. They do not make you feel rushed when you meet with them and they continually provide the best help that they can to each individual student. It can be a difficult transition for many students, and the advising staff at UMES is readily available to help in any way that they can.', 'Within my first few minutes on campus at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, the director of the program for which I was interviewing personally greeted me.

There's less distractions and the University of Hartford is so close by you can go visit people there whenever you want!"", 'USJ has a small campus with teachers that are always willing to help and free tutors whenever you need one. This environment is set up for you to achieve, with advisers always there to help and there are plenty of opportunities to meet with other students who graduated with the same attended major. In addition, there is always a ton of things to do on campus whenever you have free time, this can range from making cell phone cases to movie nights!']]",University of Saint Joseph Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Saint-Joseph/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/53726,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,28,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00035-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,912286851,912249382,HORIZONTAL,"{4647=This school is really expensive.

I find that attendance and participation is usually sub-par but those who do are wonderful and incredible people.', 'Studious, serious, students who have lots of family obligations or need to work to put themselves through school. This school is also known for making accommodations for non traditional students with special circumstances, learning or physical disabilities, mental or physical illnesses, etc. I find this school to be helpful as writer because the limited interest results in lesser competition meaning I get a lot of attention and help from my professors.', 'I am going to be taking a study abroad course in the Spring semester which will allow me to travel to the Netherlands for two weeks for less than $3,000 including lodging, transportation, and some meals included, as the university is subsidizing the trip. I will be taking a similar class next year which will allow me to go to Japan for two weeks for $4,000, much cheaper than it would be otherwise. The university also offers a plethora of activities, workshops, and other opportunities to facilitate your personal growth and make you more marketable to employees and graduate schools.', 'West Hartford Center and Blue Back Square is a ten minute drive from campus and offers a number of boutiques, shops, restaurants to choose from in addition to a movie theater. Six Flags New England is about forty minutes away by car, Westfarms Mall is about twenty minutes away and I often spend Saturdays in Boston or New York City. The university hosts a large numbers of events during the week and many girls visit friends at other colleges during the weekends.', 'The dining services are limited in availability and options, as one would expect in a small school. There is one dining hall, one grab-and-go cafe, many places to use microwaves to heat up your food if you bring some from home, and each residence hall and suite is equipped with a fully functional kitchen.', ""I'm a commuter, but given my experiences visiting and sleeping over with my resident friends, res life at USJ seems to be much quieter and more peaceful than what I've seen at other larger schools. About 55% of the undergraduate student body are commuters and many of the girls go home on the weekends to work or spend time with family, providing a great time to study and a good measure of privacy for those who remain on campus."", 'Allowing for variance between classes, I find USJ to be academically rigorous but I usually take difficult classes that assign 300+ pages of reading a week and weekly writing assignments (papers, reflections, etc.). You, as a student, have the ability decide to take easier or harder classes and whether to put in a lot or a little effort. In order to graduate, all students must submit and pass a writing portfolio designed to embody graduates with critical reading, writing, and thinking skills that will make them valuable and attractive to future employers or potential graduate schools.', 'Life at USJ (or at any school, frankly) is predominately what you make it. There are so many opportunities for personal growth and learning but you have to take the initiative to pursue them. If all you want to do is party for four years, you will be bored here and should consider another school. If you plan to sit in your room and watch Netflix all day, expecting friends, fun, good grades, and opportunities to come to you, you will find that you hate it here. Your experience is only ever going to be what you make it and you should expect nothing less than this.', 'It is certainly difficult to condense and summarize the experiences of 1,000 very different women but I find USJ to be predominately a positive, accepting, and academically-driven place. The people I have met here are driven, over-achievers, friendly, hard-working, and compassionate.

Having that said, there is nothing we can't do... Oh, you don't think so? Well, here's why I'm saying this; I have grown from not knowing anything about online work to being a general VA to be a WP web design assistant, mobile marketing/SEO and social media assistant and more... I didn't learn this from taking jobs I was an expert in. I learned this from those clients who are willing to take my skills and their skills and put them together, as a team. With that you'll create a personalized set of skills and assets for your business. Ã¢Â€ÂœYou can't do today's job with yesterday's methods and be in business tomorrowÃ¢Â€? Teamwork, communication, honesty and definitely communication (yes I mentioned that twice), are key to establishing a long lasting, profitable work relationship.}"
