There are various fields of studies pertaining to those three, and many that combine two or more.

It's also best if you have a B average because even though this school is fun, it's tough academically. If you don't have any studying skills, you better learn quickly.

If you don't have any studying skills, you better learn quickly. Actually, most of the classes will force you to change your ways or discover new methods. Also, learn to be social. UTD is all about interaction with others and building your network. Plus it√¢¬Ä¬ôll just help you overall in the long run., 483757=I think I touched on it before, UTD is very competitive. I think this imcoming freshman class of 2018 had something like 90 National Merit Scholars. That alone should tell you something. Its a healthy competition though, the kind that really sharpens you and makes you want to strive harder to succeed., 323482=Automatic Acceptance with a 1200 reading and math score on your SAT/ 29 on your ACT. You don't have to be top whatever percent to get in automatically unlike UT and A&M, but for some reason UTD has a higher number of National merit scholars than the rest of Texas universities combined. (That says something) Apply for FINANCIAL AID!!! And go to Comet camp., 381704=If you did not get into the CV program at UTD, it's okay! If you work hard your first freshman semester you will be able to apply mid December. It's important never to give up. The teachers are helpful., 14159=Keep your GPA as high as possible. You are not expected to have a perfect 4.0, so don't stress about it, but just work hard to keep it up. Your SAT scores don't have to be that amazing either, as long as it is close to 1200 or above you are all set to go. You do not have to go to a school with very high requirements to get a good education., 414185=If you're really looking into getting into UTD, I suggest you take care of your grades and standardized test scores. If you're in the top 15% of your class in Texas you'll probably get automatic acceptance into the school. If your SATs range from 1800 and up you're set and the same goes for ACTs 27 and up. If you're lacking in any of the numeric fields then I suggest you amp up your essay writing skills!, 1709=Maintain the Best GPA you can. Try to make a 1200 combined SAT or 26 ACT score. The University looks for the well-rounded, so respond in your application accordingly. UTD is Great for Pre-Med and Pre-Law prospectives!, 107317=1. Get involved early and develop the relationships that will carry you far in life. 180+ student organizations exist on campus, so you will definitely find one that matches you and others like you. 2. Commuters, get to campus before 9:30 am if you want save yourself 15 minutes of walking to class. Parking gets full quickly. 3. What you get out of college if what you put into it. UTD is no different; you can easily just go through UTD without a trace of yourself but leave something behind if possible., 510722=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 448=This University offers an excellent incentive for all students, of any state or country. As a Georgian, non-Texas resident, I was worried about the cost of tuition for an out of state acceptee. Yet, through a school program called Academic Excellence Scholarship Program, I was granted in-state tuition and an additional $1000 per semester for tuition. Plus my financial aid package has been incredible, and I received only a small amount of loan funds, and plenty of refund cash. Plus, I received only the most basic scholarship there is, but I have the opportunity to upgrade it to a full ride including room and board by maintaining a 3.75 GPA. The highest scholarship a freshman applicant can receive grants full tuition, room and board, plus a $5000 stipend for personal expenses!!! I encourage all to apply, and to check out the website at utdallas.edu. Look for something called assured admission, which guarantees your acceptance. DO NOT WORRY if you do not automatically get an AES scholarship because you can apply for one after your first term of enrollment.}",,

Overall my trip experience was: Excellent Malawi was absolutely wonderful, one of our best holidays ever. Would love to go back some day. Weather in Cape Town was variable, from sun to hail, through wind and rain, so we couldn't do a couple of things that we wanted to do (go up Table Mountain and visit Robben Island). We did see whales at Hermanus, which was on our to-do list, and penguins at Betty's Bay. City bus tours were good for getting to know the city. We were very glad we hired the car for two days as this enabled us to see the coast and the wine area.

Overall my trip experience was: Excellent Malawi was absolutely wonderful, one of our best holidays ever. Would love to go back some day. Weather in Cape Town was variable, from sun to hail, through wind and rain, so we couldn't do a couple of things that we wanted to do (go up Table Mountain and visit Robben Island). We did see whales at Hermanus, which was on our to-do list, and penguins at Betty's Bay. City bus tours were good for getting to know the city. We were very glad we hired the car for two days as this enabled us to see the coast and the wine area.

The analyst indicated that companies are still running mission critical applications on non-Linux platforms, primarily z/OS, Solaris and Windows. What does help Linux are old UNIX Legacy applications, the existence of OpenSolaris x86, Oracle's Enterprise Linux, VMware and Hyper-V support for Linux, Linux on System z mainframe, and other legacy operating systems that are growing obsolete. One issue cited with Linux is scalability. Performance on systems with more than 32 processor cores is unpredictable. More mature operating systems like z/OS and AIX have stronger support for high-core environments. The analyst mentioned Microsoft's upcoming Windows Server 2008 R2, which will run only on 64-bit hardware but support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. It will provide scalability up to 256 processor cores. Microsoft wants Windows to get into the High Performance Computing (HPC) marketplace, but this is currently dominated by Linux and AIX. The analyst's advice to Microsoft: System Center should manage both Windows and Linux. 35","Certainly, all three types of operating system have a place, but there are definite trends and shifts in this marketspace. technorati tags: , IBM, AIX, Linux, Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, NonStop, RTI, z/OS Show: 10 25 50 items per page Previous Next Jump to page of 1 Feed for Blog Entries √¢¬ñ¬º",True,0,0,"{88343=Of these, the analyst consider IBM POWER running AIX to be the safest investment.

This rule is health protective due to the revised emissions limits for the stacks and the requirement of enhanced fugitive emissions controls that will achieve significant reductions of process fugitive emissions, especially manganese., 313805=On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) from the new and existing Portland cement manufacturing industry at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). Subsequently, the EPA has become aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and is, accordingly, proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule. In addition, the EPA plans to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense in the final technical correction rule., 272312=In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes that it has completed its statutory obligation of the Clean Air Act to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than ninety percent of the aggregated emissions of each of the seven hazardous air pollutants enumerated in section 112(c)(6). This document explains the basis for the agency's conclusion that it completed this obligation in February of 2011, identifies the promulgated standards that collectively satisfy the obligation, and provides the public an opportunity to comment., 239432=On February 1, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers (Area Source Boilers Rule). Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on five issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document. In this action, the EPA is also proposing a limited number of technical corrections and amendments to the final rule to correct inadvertent errors and to clarify some applicability and implementation issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue. The EPA is seeking comment only on the five issues being reconsidered, the proposed deletion of the affirmative defense and on the technical corrections and amendments described in the preceding paragraph. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule., 277468=On November 7, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production source categories and to new source performance standards for several phosphate processing categories. The EPA is extending the deadline for written comments on the proposed amendments by 30 days to January 21, 2015. The EPA received requests for an extension from The Fertilizer Institute, several phosphate facilities and a testing company that supports the industry. The Fertilizer Institute has requested the extension in order to allow more time to review the proposed rule and associated emissions data, risk assessment and technology review., 207516=On August 5, 2014, The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) requested an Alternative Means of Emission Limitation (AMEL) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) in order to operate pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its Propane Dehydrogenation Plant and its Light Hydrocarbons Plant at its Texas Operations site located in Freeport, Texas. On October 21, 2014, ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil) requested an AMEL under the CAA for its pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its' Olefins Plant in Baytown, Texas, and its' Plastics Plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. In this document, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting comment on all aspects of the AMEL requests and the resulting alternative operating conditions that are necessary to achieve a reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions required by various standards in 40 CFR parts 60, 61 and 63 that apply to emission sources controlled by these pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares. These standards point to the operating requirements for flares in the General Provisions to parts 60 and 63, respectively, to comply with the emission reduction requirements. Because pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares cannot meet the velocity requirements in these General Provisions, Dow and ExxonMobil are seeking an AMEL., 324000=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys Production√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 18 days., 282877=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the November 13, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNESHAP Risk and Technology Review for the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries; NESHAP for Wool Fiberglass Area Sources√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 30 days., 250747=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the December 8, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Secondary Aluminum Production√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 15 days., 17867=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice that it has responded to 23 petitions for reconsideration of the final rules titled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance (NSPS) for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units, published in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The agency previously granted reconsideration on several discrete issues and took final action on reconsideration through documents published in the Federal Register on April 24, 2013, and November 19, 2014.

Because pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares cannot meet the velocity requirements in these General Provisions, Dow and ExxonMobil are seeking an AMEL., 324000=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys Production√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 18 days., 282877=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the November 13, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNESHAP Risk and Technology Review for the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries; NESHAP for Wool Fiberglass Area Sources√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 30 days., 250747=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the December 8, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Secondary Aluminum Production√¢¬Ä? is being extended for 15 days., 17867=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice that it has responded to 23 petitions for reconsideration of the final rules titled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance (NSPS) for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units, published in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The agency previously granted reconsideration on several discrete issues and took final action on reconsideration through documents published in the Federal Register on April 24, 2013, and November 19, 2014. The Administrator denied the remaining requests for reconsideration in separate letters to the petitioners dated April 21, 2015. A document providing a full explanation of the agency's rationale for each denial is in the docket for these rules., 297504=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAP promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between May 25, 2005 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is providing notice proposing to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 23232=On February 24, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule approving the updated delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources) to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 260722=On December 18, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for brick and structural clay products manufacturing and NESHAP for clay ceramics manufacturing. The EPA is extending the deadline for written comments on the proposed rule by 30 days to March 19, 2015. In addition, the EPA is changing the date of the public hearing, if requested, to January 27, 2015, and the date to pre-register for the hearing if it is held., 79061=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on its reconsideration of the startup and shutdown provisions in the final rules titled, √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- and Oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units.√¢¬Ä? The national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) issued pursuant to Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 are referred to as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), and the new source performance standards (NSPS) issued pursuant to CAA section 111 are referred to as the Utility NSPS. On November 30, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted reconsideration of, proposed, and requested comment on a limited set of issues in the February 16, 2012, final MATS and Utility NSPS, including certain issues related to the final work practice standards applicable during startup periods and shutdown periods. On June 25, 2013, the EPA reopened the public comment period for the reconsideration issues related to the startup and shutdown provisions of MATS and the startup and shutdown provisions related to the particulate matter (PM) standard in the Utility NSPS. The EPA is now taking final action on the standards applicable during startup periods and shutdown periods in MATS and on startup and shutdown provisions related to the PM standard in the Utility NSPS., 329188=This action proposes amendments in addition to those proposed on November 25, 2011, and April 15, 2013, for the Mineral Wool Production and Wool Fiberglass Manufacturing source categories. This action addresses comments received on previous proposals, explains changes to previously proposed limits for sources in these industries and clarifies our use of the upper prediction limit (UPL) in setting MACT floors. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking comments on only aspects of the proposed rules that are discussed in this document. When finalized, these proposed standards would increase the level of environmental protection., 100868=On January 30, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines and the Standards of Performance for Stationary Internal Combustion Engines. Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. On September 5, 2013, the EPA announced reconsideration of and requested public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration. A summary of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice of reconsideration and the EPA's responses to those comments (Response to Comment document) can be found in the rulemaking docket at Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0708. After careful consideration of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice, the EPA has determined that it will not propose any changes to the regulations at this time related to the three petition issues, and is providing notice of this decision. The EPA is informing the petitioners of the decision in separate letters to the petitioners. The letters explain the EPA's reasons for not proposing changes to the regulations for those three issues. Further discussion of the three petition issues can be found in the Response to Comment document., 31648=On November 19, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amending certain reporting requirements in the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Steam Generating Units (Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)) rule. This final rule amends the reporting requirements in the MATS rule by temporarily requiring owners or operators of affected sources to submit certain required emissions and compliance reports to the EPA through the Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System (ECMPS) Client Tool, and the rule temporarily suspends the requirement for owners or operators of affected sources to submit certain reports using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI)., 362314=This action supplements our proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on November 23, 2011. In that action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments based on the initial technology and residual risk reviews for this source category. Today's action presents a revised technology review and a revised residual risk review for the Ferroalloys Production source category and proposes revisions to the standards based on those reviews. This action also proposes new compliance requirements to meet the revised standards. This action would result in significant environmental improvements through the reduction of fugitive manganese emissions and through more stringent emission limits for several processes., 288054=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys Production√¢¬Ä? is being extended an additional 11 days., 12680=In this action the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalizes its proposed determination that the EPA completed its statutory obligation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than 90 percent of the aggregated emissions of each of seven specific hazardous air pollutants (HAP) enumerated in the CAA. On December 16, 2014, the EPA published the proposed determination that stated the basis for the agency's conclusion that it completed this obligation in February of 2011 by identifying the promulgated standards that collectively satisfy this obligation and provided the public an opportunity to comment on the EPA's determination. This action finalizes the EPA's determination., 201492=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to correct and clarify certain text of the final action titled √¢¬Ä¬úNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units,√¢¬Ä? which was published in the Federal Register of Thursday, February 16, 2012. We are also proposing to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense for malfunction events in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 212996=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the receipt of a complete petition requesting that the EPA add the chemical n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) (Chemical Abstract Service No. 106-94-5) to the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) contained in section 112(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). On October 28, 2010 and November 28, 2012, the Halogenated Solvent Industry Alliance (HSIA) submitted a petition to list nPB as a HAP and a supplement to the petition, respectively. In addition, on November 24, 2011, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitted a petition to add nPB to the HAP list. We have determined that these petitions are complete for purposes of this process, which means they provide sufficient information to assess the human health impacts on people living in the vicinity of facilities emitting nPB. Today's document initiates our comprehensive technical review phase of the petition process. The EPA invites the public to comment on these petitions and to provide additional data, beyond what are in these petitions, on sources, emissions, exposure, health effects and environmental impacts associated with nPB that may be relevant to our technical review. These petitions and supporting information are available through Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0471. Following completion of the technical review phase that is initiated by today's notice and runs through the EPA's evaluation of all the comments received, the EPA will decide whether to grant or deny the petitions., 378224=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the June 30, 2014, proposed √¢¬Ä¬úPetroleum Refinery Sector Risk and Technology Review and New Source Performance Standards√¢¬Ä? is being extended by 60 days., 245029=On January 31, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers and process heaters at major sources of HAP. Subsequently, the EPA received 10 petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. The EPA is seeking comment only on these three issues. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule. Additionally, the EPA is proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule to clarify definitions, references, applicability and compliance issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 90095=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving, through a √¢¬Ä¬údirect final√¢¬Ä? procedure, the straight delegation of authority and approval of the mechanism used for the implementation and enforcement of certain unchanged Federal section 112 rules to the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), pursuant to section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). A more detailed description of the procedures used to implement the delegation is set forth in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between ADEQ and EPA, dated September 17, 2014, a copy of which may be found in the docket for this rulemaking, as discussed below. The delegation only encompasses sources subject to one or more Federal section 112 standards (Part 63 standards specifically) which are also subject to the requirements of the Title V operating permits program. The delegation of authority under this action does not include authorities contained in CAA section 112(r)., 351553=This action corrects our supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on October 6, 2014. In that action, there is an incorrect location for the public hearing. This document amends the public hearing location and the date the hearing will be held, if requested.}","Wed, 01 Jul 2015 17:01:27 GMT",{1028=Title 40 published on 2014-07-01.}

An automated computer system coded write-in responses to Question 13b into more than 380 detailed language categories. This automated procedure compared write-in responses with a master computer code list - which contained approximately 55,000 previously coded language names and variants - and then assigned a detailed language category to each write-in response. The computerized matching assured that identical alphabetic entries received the same code. Clerical coding categorized any write-in responses that did not match the computer dictionary.
