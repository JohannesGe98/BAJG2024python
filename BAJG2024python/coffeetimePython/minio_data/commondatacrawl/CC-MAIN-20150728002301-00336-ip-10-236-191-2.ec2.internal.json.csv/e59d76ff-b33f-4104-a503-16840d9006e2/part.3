Here they will mold you into the young man or woman you want to be. Teachers love to help they emphasize their office hours and they certainly acknowledge effort.

I had a couple of friends who attempted to make it into sororities, but ended up quitting for certain reasons. Once one makes it past Hell Week, there is really no other stresses of being a member of the sorority.', 'As I mentioned earlier, LC CAB does a great job of putting on activities and events for the students to attend. The hall directors and RAs in the dorms also do a lot to put on little events in the dorm halls.', 'I think Lakeland being the diverse school that it is, is really great for any student. It is suitable for all ages, races, and religions as well. I would recommend it to anyone!', ""There aren't any real unusual places or traditions on campus. Only one thing comes to mind that was fairly unusual. A couple of students decided it would be funny to bring a cow up the stairs of Old Main, which didn't have elevators at that time. The students didn't know that cows cannot climb down stairs, so they couldn't get the cow down and ended up having to kill it; they say that the cow now haunts Old Main."", 'The school is rather expensive to attend considering it is a private school; however, the school does offer a lot of scholarship opportunities and ways to save money. I would definitely consider it a great bang for your buck.', 'Even though the school is in the middle of a corn field, there is plenty of things to do for entertainment nearby as well as on campus. The school has a group called LC CAB, which is a group that organizes fun and games as well as activities both on campus and off. There are bowling alleys, golf courses, movie theaters, malls, and a lot of other things nearby as well. We have gone to Brewers games, Bucks games, bowling, plays, and many more activities with the LC CAB. On campus there are also events called convocations, you will learn about these when you visit the school, but some of them are plays, musicals, comedians, writers, speeches, and many more options; they are good time fillers and believe it or not, some of them are very entertaining.', ""Lakeland's food and dining center is wonderful. There is always a salad and sandwich bar for those students who do not want to eat the main course for that meal. I love the Muskie Mart, which offers grilled food as well as serving the students like a grocery store. You have Muskie Money that you get when you pay for your payment plan. It is wonderful not having to carry cash everywhere when you are on campus."", ""Once you come out of your shell and experience life in the dorms for a while, it feels like you have an entirely new family. I did not come out of my shell right away and wish I would have, I met a lot of great people and they became very close to me. I loved living in the all girls' dorm rooms, it was a lot of fun because we could screw around and just have fun without worrying that we aren't impressing any guys, and what not."", 'The teachers are very helpful and stick to their syllabus. I have never had a problem scheduling a meeting with a professor to get help on my coursework or in the class in general. Also, the class sizes are super small, which is a huge advantage to quicker learning and more one-on-one time.', ""A few tips for prospective students: do not let the school being in the middle of a corn field scare you away, it is better than one would think. Do not be afraid to try new activities; it is a great way to meet new people and make some friends. Don't forget to be yourself; college can be a lot like high school when it comes to personal issues and such, but don't be afraid to let your real self shine, most people like that better than you trying to fit in. Lastly, have fun; the time flies by faster than you would believe, take the time to enjoy your experiences."", 'Lakeland college is awesome; there are activities, athletics, and academics. The staff of the school makes the experience that much better with their small class sizes and increased one-on-one time.

Public housing funds of any kind are not an eligible donation. Applicant staff time is not an eligible donation. Applicants shall annotate the HUD-424-CB to list the sources and amount of each donation. 4. Donations that were included in your HOPE VI NOFA application that specifically apply to the Neighborhood Networks program described in your HOPE VI NOFA may also be included in your NN NOFA application.

Letters of","Rating Factor 5: Achieving Results and Evaluation Methods (5 Points) A. Description. 1. Under this rating factor, applicants must demonstrate how they propose to measure their success and outcomes. This rating factor requires that the applicant identify goals, interim and final program outcomes, and their time frames. Examples of outcomes are: increasing the homeownership rates among participants, increasing participants' financial stability (e.g., increasing assets of a household through savings), or increasing employment stability (e.g., whether persons assisted obtain or retain employment for one or two years during participation). 2. Performance indicators should be objectively quantifiable and measure actual achievements against anticipated achievements. Your narrative should identify what you are going to measure, how you are going to measure it, and the steps you have in place to adjust your plans if outcomes are not met within established time frames. B. Scoring: 1. If you show interim and final measurable outcomes, with time frames, for each of several participant sub-groups, and show plans for adjusting your program, you will receive up to 5 points. 2. If you show interim and final measurable outcomes, with time frames, but without plans for adjusting your program, you will receive up to 2 points. 3.

SpoC 007 follows up the successful AoC 06 (OWASP Autumn Of Code 2006) in which 9 projects were sponsored and greatly improved. The objective of SpoC 007 is to allow contributors to allocate considerable resources on (existent or new) OWASP projects which are relevant and benefitial to the OWASP community. The initial Budget for SpoC 007 will be $110,000 USD, and it is funded by OWASP (using current membership fees and profits from past conferences) and newly joined members (currently SPI Dynamics and EDS). In parallel with the Request for Proposals OWASP is also doing a membership drive where all membership fees commited during that period will be allocated to SpoC 007 projects (the new members have the option to chose which projects they would like to sponsor) The SpoC 007 structure and organization is very similar to the AoC 06 (see OWASP Autumn Of Code 2006, OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 - Applications and OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 - Selection for more details.) whereby the major changes are: Bigger budget (with a $20,000 USD sponsorship), the special project:",True,0,0,"{10804=The only requirement is that the candidate shows the potential to accomplish the project's objectives and the commitment to dedicate the time required to complete it in the allocated time frame (projects must be completed by 9th July 2007)., 11781=To submit a project, you will need to submit it (i.e. post it) on the OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 Applications page (DON'T send your propoposal direcly).
