A solar year is about 365.25 days long, while a lunar month is about 29.53 days long. Twelve lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall a little short of a year. On the other hand, thirteen lunar months are 18 days too many. The problem with designing an accurate civil calendar is that the three natural units of time -- the day, the month and the year -- are based on different movements -- the earth's rotation about its axis, the moon's revolution around the earth and the earth's revolution around the sun. Meanwhile, many religious and social customs also became tied to the cycle of the seasons. Most religious festivals were fixed with respect to the phases of the moon, since these were relatively easy to observe. The civil calendar which standardised the length of the year also had to take this into account. As trading spread and goods were exported from one area to another, it became important to be able to agree on a common measure of time. One needed to be able to define a civil year which could be used to regulate trade and commerce. In the beginning, it was sufficient to just keep track of the seasons. However, the seasons vary slightly in length from year to year. The beginning of summer","Simha August 17 Ashvina Purattasi Kanya September 17 Kartika Aipasi Tula October 18 Margashira Kartigai Vrishchia November 17 Pushya Margazhi Dhanus December 16 Magha Thai Makara January 14 Phalguna Masi Kumbha February 13 Chaitra Panguni Meena March 15 The name of each month in Kerala corresponds to the Zodiac constellation that that sun is in during that month. Thus, during the month of Mesha, the sun is in the constellation Mesha. By measuring the progress of the sun along the ecliptic, one can keep track of the passage of the year. If we fix the point on the ecliptic where the sun is now, the sun will next return there exactly a year later. Of course we cannot directly observe which stars the sun is passing in front of, since we cannot see the stars when the sun is shining. However, we can indirectly infer the position of the sun by observing which stars on the ecliptic are",True,0,0,"Mon, 29 Aug 2005 05:43:48 GMT","{22093=When the new calendar was put in use, to correct the error already accumulated in the thirteen centuries since the Council of Nicaea, a deletion of ten days was made in the solar calendar. The last day of the Julian calendar was 4 October 1582 and this was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar 15 October 1582., 14491=Two well known sankrantis are Makara Sankranti or Pongal around January 14 and Mesh Sankranti on April 14. Mesha Sankranti marks the beginning of the new year in Assam, Bengal, Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu -- these states follow a purely solar calendar for fixing the length of the year., 18694=Surprisingly, there is still a widely used calendar which is purely lunar -- the Islamic calendar. The Islamic calendar consists of twelve lunar months, with no correction for the extra days in a solar year. As a result, the Islamic months move forward by about 11 days every solar year. So, for instance, the month of Ramzan (or Ramadan) keeps shifting.It used to occur in mid summer during the 1980s but moved to February--March in the mid nineties and is now in November in the year 2005., 17791=Note that in 1991-92, there were two adhika maasas -- Ashvina and Phalguni. This is always the case -- a year with a kshaya maasa will have two adhikamaasa., 22889=An interesting aside: Many non Catholic countries like England, Scotland and thereby the rest of the British Empire (including part of what is now the United States) refused to adopt what was considered a Catholic invention, and did not adopt it until 1752, by which time it was necessary to correct by eleven days (2 September 1752 being followed by 14 September 1752). This is reflected these days in the fact that if you use the calendar command on your computer (UNIX/LINUX system) for September 1752 (""cal 9 1752"") you will find that the dates 3 to 13 September are missing., 21186=However, it turns out as we have mentioned earlier, that a tropical year is not 365.25 days long but 365.2422 days long. This tiny extra fraction of .0078 days a year adds up to approximately three days every four centuries., 6627=At the summer solstice June 21, the tilt is maximum towards the sun while at the winter solstice December 22, it is maximum away from the sun. Between the soltices fall the equinoxes, when the axis is not tilted with respect to the sun. The vernal equinox is on March 21 and the autumnal equinox on September 23., 21419=This discrepancy was so small that it went unnoticed for several hundred years. By the 13th century, some scientists and philosophers had begun to suggest that a reform was needed in the calendar. However, the actual reform had to wait another 300 years, till March 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII announced a new calendar., 17012=Occasionally, a very peculiar situation occurs -- a lunar month spans two sankrantis. This, for example, is what happened in 1991-92. There is no amavasya during the solar month Magha. As a result, the lunar month Magha was ""lost"" and became a kshaya maasa., 15188=The first lunar month of the year in Chaitra. In Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat, Chaitra begins with the last amavasya before Mesha Sankranti (April 14)., 8214=So the tropical year is shorter than a sidereal year -- the tropical year is 365.2422 days long while a sidereal year is 365.2564 days long. As a result, a calendar based on the sidereal year (like the Indian solar calendars which we will read about later) will gradually begin to err with respect to the seasons -- the ""real"" equinoxes and solstices will shift away from the original dates specified by the calendar., 21748=Pope Gregory's solution was to declare that a century year was not a leap year unless it was divisible by 400. Thus 1600 and 2000 are leap years but 1700, 1800, 1900 are not, though they are divisible by 4 like normal leap years. In this way 3 days were dropped every 400 years and the error in the Julian calendar was corrected., 8650=We see this in the two prominent Sankrantis (see below) -- Makara Sankranti (January 14) and Mesha Sankranti (April 14). These two dates are supposed to denote the winter solstice and vernal equinox respectively. However, since the time these dates were fixed, the equinoxes have shifted back by about 24 days due to precession., 20659=Julius Caesar went further. Realising that a permanent solution was needed to prevent this problem from recurring, he decided to reform the calendar. By then, astronomers had calculated the tropical year to be 365.25 days long. So Julius Caesar began the practice of having normal years of 365 days with an extra day added every fourth year to take care of the extra quarter day which had accumulated each year. In the new Julian calendar, the year began with January 1 and the vernal equinox fell on March 21.}",

But I dont think this or really anything will stop piracy. This guy isnt the first one to get in trouble over something like this and he definitely wont be the last. If people can choose between free or any price they are gonna want to choose free. People like him make it easy to do. So long as they keep uploading it will keep happening.', 'Post #545068', 'Those examples are probably quite bad to argue for the pirating of anime/manga/dramas. These industries have been allowing an awful lot of copyright infringement and distribution by fans without their permission to global audiences (though mainly english). It is important that they make case studies of individuals to send the message that they will not let it spread passed a certain level which they tolerate. It\'s the principle in practise. While I\'m not saying that the cases used here can be used to support piracy, I think there are situations where the consequences of piracy are less severe. Take, for example, anime and manga series that are not being translated/subbed into english (using America and the UK markets as my example here). The companies lose no money from people whose first language is english watching pirated subbed anime or reading scanslated manga. The anime/manga was never available in the english speaking markets in the first place so therefore there was no money to lose. hmm, I suppose it becomes an issue if companies ever wanted to publish it in english as the material would already be in circulation... Anime has additional issues, though. Subbed anime still retains the original sound track and people who speak the original language (Japanese) can watch the anime and make sense of it, while not paying. However, this can be mitigated if online video sharing sites (youtube etc.) block videos in certain countries (which is already being done on Youtube). Even this banning of videos in certain countries becomes useless as time passes. Manga goes out of print (examples: Mars, Bound Beauty etc.) and drama and anime series are become unavailable or were never stocked in the first place (example, Coffee Prince). Piracy is illegal, but just because it\'s illegal doesn\'t mean the situations where it is (I\'ll stick a ""relatively"" in here) undamaging shouldn\'t be ignored. The spread of anime/manga/asian dramas out of asia is inevitable and to be desired. When companies fail to provide reasonably priced products with a large selection of series people turn to other methods to get what they want. Whether companies should condemn this or try to mitigate the consequences and work around it is a question that demands you consider piracy as more than just illegal. ________________ I am the master of my fate; I am the captin of my soul. William Ernest Henely I rate manga with 5 being the average score.', 'Post #545078', ""Did I in any way say or hint that I am entitled to something that doesn't belong to me? Don't make false assumptions! I am looking at the bigger picture here. There is always a limit to greed. Always penny pinching will end up costing more than what its worth. Going that far for a made for tv series is not practical as only the hard core fans of the show will actually go out and buy the dvds while majority will be like I already saw that on TV. In a way they are fighting for DVD sales number that never existed and never will exist. Going this aggressive will eventually lead to production companies going bankrupt which leads to loss in jobs and less anime for us because it costs money to hunt uploaders down.. I said channels pay production companies atleast enough to cover all production costs but production companies can demand more depending on the popularity of the show. Do you have any idea how much earnings channels get from tv ad revenue? Depending on the popularity of the show one 30 second ad is enough to cover the sale of a few thousand to several thousand dvd sales. Multiply that by 16 since most shows are around 22 mins long and that is how much a channel makes airing one episode of the show. You know one programmer can actually make a 3d game provided that he/she has the graphic pictures of parts without an actual animator. There is an actual college course that teaches this and its just so happenes one of my friends took this course and he made a fully fuctional 3d game in 3 months. He showed me while working on it and also showed the finished project. You do realize when colleges teach you programming they teach you the hard way first then teach you the easyway few courses later but by this time most future programmers loose their patience and leave programming for good. Why are they underpaid? It is greediness on someone's part. In otherwords the boss. The companies will be saying otherwise once they get wrapped up in all kinds of legal fees."", 'Post #545080', ""Greedy or not, piracy is illegal and it is within their right to go after the perpetrator so it doesn't really matter if it aired on TV.

Not to diminish your friends achievement, but the game probably isn't anything to be really proud of. There are game making kits(not sure if that's the correct name) out there with the necessary graphics and even parts of code out there, but with those you can mostly make extremely generic games.

Or at least use the free services the site provides. That\'s probably the best affordable way to support the anime industry for international fans, since not everyone can afford to import expensive blurays in today\'s economy. As for my opinion on the industry... The anime industry has been in need of modernization for a long time and I think companies can benefit financially from subbing their shows into other languages and uploading them on their official site or alternatively an official youtube channel or crunchyroll or sell them via PSN, etc... The more mediums the better IMO. There is a huge untapped international market and even providing anime for ""free"" (via youtube for example) can net significant ad revenue. Funimation started providing its licensed anime via official youtube channel and their own site a long time ago (I think some shows are even available with japanese voice and subs). As for cracking down on pirates (specifically the Japanese nationals who upload) it\'s within the companies rights to do so, which is exactly why they do it. Unfortunately that won\'t stop piracy. If the companies continue to resist adapting to the realities of the internet the anime industry won\'t have a very bright future. Especially since the poor folk who work their asses off to draw anime are extremely (and I stress that) underpaid. Quote from Reiten I\'d really like to see that game.

Your friend may have made a game, but it wasn't a AAA game like RE4 is, so basing that for your judgment on how easily games are made today is totally ridiculous and is evidence that you are underestimating game development.

J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15(3), 3546-3559; doi:10.3390/ijms15033546, 39913=As multifactorial diseases, both CAD and IS shared common risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome [31], and the common pathophysiologic mechanisms is atherosclerosis [32]. Atherosclerosis is an extremely complex disease process with a number of important cellular contributors, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells (monocyte and T cells) [33Ã¢Â€Â“35]. Traditional risk factors lead to atherosclerosis by disrupting the function of these cells [35,36]. There have been many hypotheses proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms of the initiation, progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque. The key points of these hypotheses include the following: (i) lipoprotein retention; (ii) endothelial dysfunction; (iii) immune and inflammation response of the artery; (iv) vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation; (v) lipid absorption by macrophages and VSMCs and the formation of foam cells; and (vi) platelet activation and thrombosis [37,38]. Various epidemiological studies in families and twins have revealed a genetic component to CAD and IS risk in humans, the gene variants involved in these pathways of atherosclerosis could contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. From over 1300 publications of genetic studies, the CAD gene database [37] includes information on more than 300 candidate genes for CAD. While a single gene or gene region only explains a small part of the cardiovascular disease risk, more large association studies, including more target genes, are needed to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease., 35424=In the present study, we showed that the frequencies of the AC/CC genotypes and C allele were associated with a decreased risk of CAD and IS. Multivariate analysis showed that known risk factors, such as BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, were independently associated with CAD and IS. Additionally, the rs1044925 AC/CC genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of CAD and IS after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In the stratified analysis, a decreased risk of CAD and IS in the subjects with an AC/CC genotype was mainly observed in males, nondrinkers and those with a BMI Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 24 kg/m2. A decreased risk of CAD in the subjects with an AC/CC genotype was also observed in nonsmokers. Foam cell formation is a well-established hallmark of early-stage atherosclerosis. The accumulation of CEs as abundant cytoplasmic lipid droplets, catalyzed by ACAT-1, causes macrophages to be foamy in appearance. A close connection between the foam cell appearance and ACAT-1 protein expression has been demonstrated in macrophages present in human atherosclerotic lesions [29]. Therefore, the possible mechanism by which ACAT-1 gene variants protect against atherosclerosis is that inhibiting ACAT-1 may directly or indirectly diminish foamy macrophage formation, thus further reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis. However, this protective effect against atherosclerosis depends on the cellular cholesterol efflux ability in reverse cholesterol transport, by which HDL is able to extract excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transfer this cholesterol to the liver for biliary excretion. In a series of studies using macrophages from ACAT-1-knockout mice, because of the impaired of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, the complete deletion of macrophage ACAT-1 may lead to free cholesterol accumulation and subsequent cytotoxicity to macrophages, thereby, exacerbating atherosclerotic lesions [20Ã¢Â€Â“23]. In the present study, C allele carriers had an increased serum HDL-C level, suggesting that cholesterol efflux was not impaired when ACAT-1 activity was partially attenuated. A recent study [30] indicated that a selective ACAT-1 inhibitor, K-604, may not induce free cholesterol accumulation but may accelerate cholesterol efflux from macrophages in an ApoE-independent manner, which can support the conclusion that the C allele of rs1044925 is associated with a decreased risk of CAD and IS. However, there were conflicting results between the ACAT-1 deletion model and the present study. To explain these discrepancies, we must understand that the ACAT-1-deletion mice show a complete absence of ACAT-1 enzyme, a condition that does not occur in pharmacologic interventions on ACAT-1 in animals or in human patients. Due to the complete absence of the ACAT-1 enzyme, the abundant accumulation of free cholesterol may be beyond the ability of intrinsic intracellular cholesterol efflux. Therefore, the mouse knockout model may be the most appropriate for demonstrating the detrimental effects of drug overdoses in animals or in humans. Partial inhibition of ACAT-1 reduced atherosclerosis, effectively suggesting that ACAT-1 inhibitors prevent atherosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. In three clinical trials in humans, nonselective inhibition of ACAT had no protective role on atherosclerotic lesions but may actually promote atherosclerosis [14Ã¢Â€Â“16]. However, the dose of ACAT inhibitor in these clinical trials was derived from the results of animal experiments or in vitro, the lipid metabolism and lesion biology differ from those in humans. The negative results may be ascribed to inappropriate dosing. Therefore, new agents with moderate inhibition of ACAT-1 need to be developed and studied in new clinical trials., 134935=Ã‚Â© 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)., 31277=Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the incidence of CAD and IS positively correlated with BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia and negatively correlated with the rs1044925 AC/CC genotypes and alcohol consumption (Table 4)., 47871=The normal values for serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI, ApoB and ApoAI to ApoB ratio at our Clinical Science Experiment Center (Nanning, China) were 3.10Ã¢Â€Â“5.17, 0.56Ã¢Â€Â“1.70, 0.91Ã¢Â€Â“1.81, 2.70Ã¢Â€Â“3.20 mmol/L, 1.00Ã¢Â€Â“1.78, 0.63Ã¢Â€Â“1.14 g/L, and 1.00Ã¢Â€Â“2.50 respectively.

That set up a tense finish in front of the packed house at CenturyLink, but Johnson eased the fans' fears when he took a pass from Clint Dempsey inside the penalty area, beat a defender and then fired a left-footed shot inside the near post. It was the first time the Sounders had won or scored multiple goals since Sept. 13 and it was Dempsey's first assist in a Sounders uniform. Gspurning's night went from bad to worse in the 85th minute when he inexplicably came outside of his area to deal with a long clearance and handled it, resulting in a straight red card from referee Silviu Petrescu. The Rapids had their best chance of the night off a corner shortly after, but Hendry Thomas' glancing header went high. GET ALL THE STATS FROM THE GAME However, the visitors picked things up in the second half, attempting to capitalize on a series of fumbles from the slippery-handed Gspurning, but creating very little in the way of big chances.

Office of Financial Aid Office of Financial Aid Skip to footer navigation Skip to site navigation Skip to page content,"This policy defines the minimum requirements for financial aid eligibility at Michigan Technological University and should not be confused with any other academic status policy enforced by other departments, schools, or colleges at Michigan Tech. Ã‚Â Students should understand the renewal criteria of each of their respective scholarships and awards. Ã‚Â Some scholarships/awards may have more stringent requirements than those listed in this policy. Ã‚Â For example, the minimum cumulative GPA to retain the Presidential and National Scholarships at Michigan Tech is a 2.5 cumulative GPA. Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) will be measured at the end of each semester and a student must meet all three (3) of the following requirements to be eligible for financial aid: Requirement 1: University Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) An undergraduate student must maintain a university cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. Requirement 2: Cumulative Pace of Completion An undergraduate student must maintain a minimum pace of completion of 67%. Ã‚Â Pace of completion is calculated by dividing the cumulative credit hours successfully completed by the cumulative number of attempted credit hours. RequirementÃ‚Â 3: Maximum Time Frame for Degree Completion Undergraduate students are permitted to receive financial aid for 150% of the required number of credits to earn their degree. Ã‚Â For example, most degree programs at Michigan Tech require 128 credits. Ã‚Â Therefore, 150% of 128 = 192.

System Parameters/Flight Plan. The LiDAR system acquisition parameters were developed based on a maximum average ground sample distance of 4 feet. Two Leica ALS50 sensors were used for acquisition. Acquisition specifications for the two sensors were as follows: Sensor 19 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 54.02 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 75,000 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.91 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.94 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1544.95 feet Side overlap - 25.31 percent Sensor 59 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 60.70 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 84,400 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.94 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.91 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1413.72 feet Side overlap - 31.66 percent LiDAR System Calibration. Prior to the LiDAR acquisition, the system underwent a calibration to verify the operational accuracy and misalignment angles. Boresight calibrations were performed for each LiDAR system at the beginning and end of each flight mission. LiDAR Data Acquisition. LiDAR data acquisition only occurred when the sky was sufficiently clear of clouds, smoke, and atmospheric haze. The LiDAR data was processed immediately after the acquisition to verify the coverage had no voids. GPS/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Post Processing. The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project. LiDAR Processing and Classification. The LiDAR data was post processed and verified to be consistent with the project requirements in terms of post spacing and absence of artifacts. The point cloud underwent classification to determine bare-earth points (class 2), noise points (class 7), water returns (class 9), and unclassified data (class 1). Class 12 contains LiDAR points removed from the overlap region between adjacent flight lines. The MASSPOINT feature class contains ground (class 2) points only.', 'The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in LAS format. The files contained LiDAR intensity and elevation measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data to make it available within Digital Coast: 1. The data were converted from State Plane Florida West coordinates to geographic coordinates. 2. The data were converted from NAVD88 heights to ellipsoid heights using Geoid03. 3. The LAS header fields were sorted by latitude and updated.', 'The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) received lidar data files via ftp transfer from the NOAA Coastal Services Center. The data are currently being served via NOAA CSC Digital Coast at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/. The data can be used to re-populate the system. The data are archived in LAS or LAZ format. The LAS format is an industry standard for LiDAR data developed by the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS); LAZ is a loseless compressed version of LAS developed by Martin Isenburg (http://www.laszip.org/). The data are exclusively in geographic coordinates (either NAD83 or ITRF94). The data are referenced vertically to the ellipsoid (either GRS80 or ITRF94), allowing for the ability to apply the most up to date geoid model when transforming to orthometric heights.']]",Docucomp ISO19115Components-HTMLTable,,http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/docucomp/page?xml=NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG/Lidar/iso/xml/2004-2008_FDEM_Southwest_m529.xml&view=ISO19115Components-HTMLTable&altview=none,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,25,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00061-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,615592371,615584169,HORIZONTAL,"MD_DataIdentification Aggregation Info | Bands | Citations | Constraints | Coverage Descriptions | Dimensions | Extents | Formats | Geographic Bounding Box Georectified Information | Georeferenceable Information | Identifiers | Instruments | Mediums | OnlineResources | Operations Platforms | Process Steps | Range Elements | Reference Systems | Responsible Parties | Series | Sources | Spatial Grids | Temporal Extents Metadata Identifier: gov.noaa.csc.maps:2004-2008_FDEM_Southwest_m529Get DataFAQHTML, 19139 XML Assess Metadata For: Completeness, DOI Readiness, CSW Readiness, Components ISO Table ViewBack to Collection NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG/Lidar View Metadata As: , , } background-color:#F0F0F0; th{ } empty-cells:show; table{","Component Title Date Citation Identifier 1 2004 - 2008 Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) Lidar Project: Southwest Florida 2009-01-01 1 Lidar Final Reports 1 North American Datum 1983 2007-01-19 2 none Top CI_Series none found Top CI_ResponsibleParty Count Component Individual Organization Position Email Role Linkage 1 resourceProvider http://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?gml=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4269 1 Citation URL ftp://ftp.csc.noaa.gov/pub/crs/beachmap/qa_docs/fl/fdem/southwest/ 1 NOAA CSC (originator) DOC/NOAA/NOS/OCM > Office for Coastal Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,",False,-1,0,,,

The agency also produces a variety of public service announcements to help make consumers more aware of rules and risks regarding gift cards. Read the latest public service feature (PDF) and listen to the latest (MPG). Gift Cards Consumers often use debit cards similarly to credit cards, but they are very different. Debit cards take money directly from the bank account rather than borrowing money at a rate of interest, and they often use a personal identification number (PIN) instead of a signature. Because debit cards deduct the purchase amount from your account, using the card carelessly can result in overdrafts, which may result in high fees. Read more about overdraft protection. Debit Cards The OCC has issued guidance to national banks on credit card practices that are unacceptable because they may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The OCC has also taken a number of formal enforcement actions against national banks that have engaged in abusive practices and has required the payment of millions of dollars in restitution to customers harmed by such practices.

Since blood is rich in iron, excessive blood loss can lead to iron depletion. Iron deficiency can be identified with simple blood tests. If an iron deficiency is diagnosed, many doctors recommend 100Ã¢\x80\x93200 mg of iron per day, although recommendations vary widely. The relationship between iron deficiency and menorrhagia is complicated. Not only can the condition lead to iron deficiency, but iron deficiency can lead to or aggravate menorrhagia by reducing the capacity of the uterus to stop the bleeding. Supplementing with iron decreases excess menstrual blood loss in iron-deficient women who have no other underlying cause for their condition.1 , 2 However, iron supplements should be taken only by people who have, or are at risk of developing, iron deficiency.', 'In one study, women with menorrhagia who took vitamin A showed significant improvement or complete normalization of menstrual blood loss. In a study of women with menorrhagia who took 25,000 IU of vitamin A twice per day for 15 days, 93% showed significant improvement and 58% had a complete normalization of menstrual blood loss.3 However, women who are or could become pregnant should not supplement with more than 10,000 IU (3,000 mcg) per day of vitamin A.', 'Black horehound has been used traditionally for heavy periods.

Mit ihrer neuen, patentierten Technologie versprechen die Schweizer mehr Leistung durch effektive und konsequente KÃƒÂ¼hlung. Ã¢Â€ÂžMarathonlÃƒÂ¤ufer verbrauchen bis zu 97 Prozent ihrer Energie fÃƒÂ¼r die WÃƒÂ¤rmeregulationÃ¢Â€Âœ Ã¢Â€Â“ zu dieser Erkenntnis gelangten Professor Winfried Joch vom Institut fÃƒÂ¼r Sportwissenschaften an der UniversitÃƒÂ¤t MÃƒÂ¼nster und Dr. Sandra ÃƒÂœckert von der UniversitÃƒÂ¤t Dortmund. Ausgehend von dieser wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis setzt X-Bionic bei der Entwicklung der innovativen Runningwear konsequent auf das Thema KÃƒÂ¼hlung. Als Vorbild entdeckten die Schweizer im Rahmen ihrer bionischen Forschungen den WÃƒÂ¼stenfuchs Fennec (Vulpes Fennec Zerda). Ideal angepasst an das Leben in groÃƒÂŸer Hitze reflektiert er durch Struktur und silbrig-helle FÃƒÂ¤rbung seines Fells von auÃƒÂŸen auftreffende Hitzestrahlung. Um sich wirkungsvoll gegen ÃƒÂœberhitzung zu schÃƒÂ¼tzen, wird ÃƒÂ¼berschÃƒÂ¼ssige KÃƒÂ¶rperwÃƒÂ¤rme ÃƒÂ¼ber die im Vergleich zum KÃƒÂ¶rper riesige OberflÃƒÂ¤che der Ohren abgestrahlt. Die Schweizer haben dieses geniale System technisch umgesetzt und das innovative Garn XITANITÃ¢Â„Â¢ entwickelt. XITANITÃ¢Â„Â¢ Im RÃƒÂ¼cken und Brustbereich eingesetzt, strahlt es die KÃƒÂ¶rperwÃƒÂ¤rme zurÃƒÂ¼ck - reflektiert WÃƒÂ¤rmestrahlung - bakteriostatisch durch Silberionen - Optimiertes Sweatmanagement verteilt den SchweiÃƒÂŸ und sorgt fÃƒÂ¼r optimale VerduntungskÃƒÂ¼hlung - ErhÃƒÂ¤lt die LeistungsfÃƒÂ¤higkeit des aktiven Sportler Mit der revolutionÃƒÂ¤ren Ã¢Â€ÂžFennecÃ¢Â€Âœ-Technologie vereint X-Bionic erstmals vier unterschiedliche KÃƒÂ¼hl-Technologien in einem Shirt Ã¢Â€Â“ dem Laufen bei grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸter Hitze steht demnach",False,-1,-1,,,

The 25-year old refused to travel to Sunderland on Monday night, claiming his 'head wasn't right' to take part in the game. Danny hasn't played since the 20th October against Liverpool and has become frustrated at his lack of first team opportunities. However, Brian revealed that Danny apoligised to the entire squad yesterday morning. Speaking to the Official Reading FC website, McDermott said: 'Importantly, we can all put this to bed now. Every person in life makes mistakes and Danny apologised to all of his teammates and the staff in a group meeting today. He asked me if he could speak to the entire group before training.' 'It took a lot of courage for him to do that and he deserves respect for his reaction. Now myself, the players and staff will all move on. We have 22 games ahead of us and together as one unit we can achieve our goals for Reading Football Club and for you the supporters.' I hope we can all put this behind us now, even though some won't be as willing to forget these incidents. People can doubt his attitude, but there is no doubting his ability on his the football field and it's that ability that is going to be needed to try and keep us in this division for the short-term., 10551=Reading Vs Swansea- Preview (Friday July 24 2015), 10744=Season Preview- Bristol City (Saturday July 25 2015), 16356=Date:Friday December 14 2012, 9781=Season Preview- Brentford (Monday July 20 2015), 9979=Bristol Rovers Vs Reading- Preview (Tuesday July 21 2015), 11118=Season Preview- Cardiff (Monday July 27 2015), 10168=Season Preview- Brighton (Wednesday July 22 2015), 10362=Reading boost Under 21 squad (Wednesday July 22 2015), 10931=Season Preview- Burnley (Saturday July 25 2015)}"

This great unit has a fully equipped kitchen, gas fireplace, washer/dryer and a patio. Located conveniently close to shopping and dining between the old town of Steamboat Springs and the base of the mountain. Just steps away from the grocery stores, coffee shops and free city shuttle. This condo was just remodeled (August of 2012) and everything inside is brand new. The kitchen is fully equipped and stocked with everything you need even for that gourmet dinner and the spacious granite counter tops will allow you to prepare multiple meals at the same time. The very large master bedroom features private bathroom, walk in closet, king bed and a flat screen TV. It is perfect to retreat in after a long day of activities or looking for privacy. The second bedroom, also on the main level, has a custom made log bunk bed with Queen and Queen and the local craftsman assured us that the bed will comfortably hold 2 couples on each level with its sturdy 800 pound frame. The loft upstairs has 2 twin beds (which can be put together to become a king) and its own TV, easily becoming the favorite spot for the kids to hang out. Enjoy the amazing views of the slopes from the living room, with a glass of wine around the fireplace. No need to worry about your ski boots being ready for the next powder day - just leave them on your own boot dryers in the unit. Your large ski locker is right outside of your condo's door. Need to relax after a hard day of skiing and relax the sore muscles? No problem - just soak in one of the 4 hot tubs, relax and watch the powder pile up for the next day. When you book this unit we will assign you a personal concierge, so you can enjoy your stay with your family and friends and not worry about a thing! Let us make that happen, just sit back and relax and make some great memories in Ski Town USA. Bed Configuration: Bedroom 1 : King Bed Bedroom 2 : Queen over Queen bunk beds Ã‚Â Loft: 2 Twins/King}",

Regatta Centre Medemblik Already in the old days, Medemblik was the Dutch regatta centre. It is the home base for many international sailing events, such as the Delta Lloyd Regatta, European and World Championships in several classes, and of yachting events like the 24-hours race. This reputation and position is due to the sheltered location at the windward shore of the IJsselmeer, to the attraction of the historical city of Medemblik, and to the effort of various organizing committees of sailing events. To enforce the position of the Netherlands as an international sailing nation, a sailing center with modern facilities - preferably in Medemblik - was required.

Each conceit should be 2-3 sentences (bonus points if you write it in verse!). A good format is the ""asÃ¢Â€Â¦ so"" comparison, as in, ""as the waves make towards the pebbled shore / so do our minutes hasten to their end."" Get crazy and creative but make sure the analogy isn't completely meaningless. Be sure to label each conceit with the situation you're comparing it to. So now that you've digested this three-stanza piece of poetic seduction, think about what the poem's main conceit is and how the speaker uses it to make his passes. In 2-4 sentences, tell us what the flea is being compared to what and how the speaker's trying to make it work.","ÃƒÂ— Standards covered in this activity: Language, Grades 11-12 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L.11-12.1 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L.11-12.2 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L.11-12.3 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L.11-12.4 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L.11-12.5 Reading: Literature, Grades 11-12 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.1 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.2 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.3 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.4 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.5 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.11-12.6 Writing, Grades 11-12 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.W.11-12.2 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.W.11-12.4 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.W.11-12.6 CCSS.ELA-Literacy.W.11-12.9 VIEW RUBRIC View Standards Sample Lesson - Activity Activity 1.1b: Diary Entry Because it's a dramatic monologue of sorts, ""The Flea"" gives us the speaker's point of view and nothing but. That means that the whole situation is presented from the male perspective. We get a full menu of his dirty desires, his persuasive arguments, his witty comebacks, but we're missing everything lady-related: her reluctance, her rebuttals, her reactions. What is this, GQ? We need some female input here, stat. In a diary entry dated a few hours after the poetic action takes place, take on the persona of this seduced woman.

But Crowley -- famous for his perseverance -- decided to stick with the drug, migalastat, in the hope that a slower-to-enroll, second phase III study would resurrect chances for eventual approval. Crowley made the right call. On Wednesday, Amicus announced results from the study demonstrating that Fabry patients taking currently available injectable drugs could switch successfully to migalastat, a pill taken every other day, and maintain kidney function required to keep theÃ‚Â rare, inherited disease under control.Ã‚Â  Based on the positive study results, Amicus intends to seek European approval for migalastat early next year. The company's U.S. filing plans are less clear. Amicus will schedule a meeting with FDA officials as soon as possible to determine if Wednesday's study results, plus data from the previous phase III study, are sufficient to seek migalastat approval here. ""We came very close to stopping development of migalastat, but we always believed patients were benefitting from the drug, so we tripled down on the program,"" said Crowley in a phone interview Tuesday night.Ã‚Â  If approved, migalastat would be the first oral therapy for Fabry, giving it a significant convenience factor over Sanofi's (SNY - Get Report) Fabrazyme and Shire's (SHPG) Replagal, both of which require bi-weekly intravenous infusions. Sales of Fabrazyme and Replagal, combined, total about $1 billion per year. Unlike its competition, Migalastat only works in Fabry patients with a specific genetic mutation, estimated to encompass between 30% and 50%Ã‚Â of Fabry patients worldwide.Ã‚Â  Amicus shares closed Tuesday night at $4.57., 16716=Amicus's migalastat takes a different approach to treating Fabry disease. The drugÃ‚Â is a ""chaperone"" which accompanies, or fixes, a patient's native enzyme. Without the Amigal chaperone, the native enzyme in a Fabry patient doesn't work well and can't get to the place in a cell where it's needed to break down GL3. But with Amigal as a helper, the native enzyme is stabilized and has increased cellular activity so it can break down GL3. Migalastat doesn't work unless enough native enzyme is present, which is why Fabry patients with too little native enzyme or badly mutated enzyme don't benefit. In the new phase III study, 60 Fabry patients with amenable mutations were treated for at least 12 months with either Fabrazyme or Replagal. Thirty-sixÃ‚Â patients were then switched to migalastat and the remaining 24 patients remained on their currently approved enzyme replacement therapy. The patients were followed for 18 months, after which two measures of kidney function -- estimated GFR and measured GFR --Ã‚Â foundÃ‚Â migalastat to be statistically equivalent to the enzyme replacement therapies, meeting the co-primary endpoints of the study. In addition, levels of plasma lyso-Gb3, a biomarker used to assess Fabry progression, remained low and stable across both arms of the study.Ã‚Â  Dr. Raphael Schiffmann of the Baylor Research Institute and an investigator in the study, said, in a statement: ""I believe the results from Study 012 show a positive treatment effect of migalastat in Fabry patients with amenable mutations."" In December 2012, the first migalastat phase III study failed to achieve its primary endpoint of kidney response compared to a placebo, although the results trended strongly in migalastat's favor. AmicusÃ‚Â dug deeper into the study and found some anomalies and data suggesting migalastat was benefiting Fabry patients, but FDA refused the company's request to change the statistical plan. In November 2013, GlaxoSmithKline returned all rights to migalastat to Amicus. Amicus now owns 100% of the worldwide rights to migalastat, which in a year or so, could become the first oral treatment for Fabry ever approved.Ã‚Â  Crowley's perseverance paid off.Ã‚Â }"

In terms of mass, the Sun is by far the dominant feature of our solar system; the Sun contains more than 99% of the mass of the entire solar system! Even Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is much, much smaller than the Sun. Although Jupiter's diameter is roughly 11 times as large as Earth's, the Sun's diameter is still almost 10 times as great as Jupiter's. In terms of volume, the Sun is 987 times as large as Jupiter, which is 1,321 times as large as Earth. The volume of a sphere varies as the cube of the sphere's diameter. Since the Sun's diameter is more than 100 times as large as the Earth's, the volume of the Sun is more than a million times the Earth's volume. To be more precise, the Sun's volume is roughly 1,304,000 times as great as Earth's. You could fit a whole lot of Earths inside of the Sun! The Sun is","Sun to Earth distance (average): 149.60 million km (92.96 million miles) 8.3 light minutes 389 times the Earth-Moon distance Surely you don't expect me to remember all of this! How can one keep track of this plethora of facts about the Sun, or at least the most important ones? Here's our take on estimates of the most critical factual notions about the Sun, and a few mathematical concepts to help relate them: Recall that the Sun is roughly 100 times as large, in terms of diameter, as Earth. This fact, plus some basic geometry (volume trends as the cube of linear distance), leads to the volume of the Sun being approximately a million times (1003 = 100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000) Earth's volume. Recall that light travels almost a million kilometers in three seconds (that is, the speed of light is roughly 300 thousand km/sec), and that light that departs from the Sun reaches our planet about eight minutes later. These two facts plus a little math can lead you to a reasonable approximation of the distance from the Sun to the Earth, as follows: 8 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 480 seconds 480 seconds ÃƒÂ· 3 seconds per million km = 160 million km this value is within about 7%",True,0,0,,"{22369=The Sun is about 149 million km (93 million miles) from Earth. This is the average distance; since Earth's orbit is an ellipse, not a perfect circle, the Earth-Sun distance varies slightly throughout the year. In early January when the Earth is at perihelion (Earth's closest point to the Sun in each orbit), Earth comes within 147.09 million km (91.40 million miles) of the Sun. In July, when Earth reaches aphelion (its furthest point from the Sun), it recedes to a distance of 152.10 million km (94.51 million miles) from the Sun. Thus the Earth-Sun distance varies by about 3%, or roughly 5 million km (3 million miles), over the course of a year. Remember, this variation in distance is NOT the cause of our seasons on Earth. This is a misconception held by many students, so beware of this when discussing this topic with your students., 26465=Since the Sun is mostly made of hydrogen, which is much less dense than the rock that makes up most of Earth, the Sun ""outweighs"" our home planet to a lesser degree than it ""out-volumes"" Earth.

That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style. Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F. A Momentum Score A Value Score A Growth Score The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.

Over a hundred years ago, Orville Gibson envisioned a guitar with back, sides, and centerblock all carved from a single piece of wood. It wasn't until 2001 that the Gibson Custom Shop produced the CS-336, a magnificent instrument that achieves this exact goal. Beautifully capped by a figured, book-matched maple top, the CS-336 Custom is a stunning semi-hollowbody like no other. Unique Body DesignTraditionally, semi-hollowbody guitars are constructed with separate back, sides, and centerblock. With the CS-336, all three components are carved from a single piece of mahogany. The result is a guitar with a bold tone and staggering degree of resonance. Gibson semi-hollowbodies have always been associated with rich, woody textures, and the unique body of the CS-336 only enhances these tonal characteristics. Overall, the body is a bit smaller than an ES-335 or ES-345, with a narrow upper-bout comparable to the ES-339.

Its V77 and V87 pickups are also designed to handle low-end rumbles with plenty of definition. Made to Get LowThe seven-string design of the RGD2127Z adds another low string beyond the standard six-string range, enabling fans of heavy riffing to reach the depths of rock and metal. Ibanez has enhanced this model's low-end range with an extra-long 26.5-inch neck scale. The longer neck is better equipped to handle drop tunings, meaning you can tune down to Antarctica before you hear fret buzz. You can take things even lower with the Edge Zero 7 bridge.

About Dividend Dividends are common dividends paid per share, reported as of the ex-dividend date. In general, profits from business operations can be allocated to retained earnings or paid to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. Stock owners receive dividends in proportion to the number of shares that they own. If a shareholder owns five shares of MSFT, and MSFT pays a one dollar dividend, the shareholder will receive five dollars. Dividends can be company and growth-specific. Rapidly growing companies (technology) often do not offer dividends; the cash is expected to invest in other business projects that fuel more growth. Steady growth companies (utilities) often offer small and consistent dividends. While some companies have a long and consistent dividend policy (General Electric), others may rarely issue dividends even under consistent positive earnings (Apple). Learn More",False,-1,0,,,

Interestingly, those same would-be reformers who balk most loudly at some regulations are wholeheartedly committed to maintaining or adding to existing regulations when it suits their political agendas, indicating that people will willingly abandon their political principles when they conflict with their efforts to attain political power. To my knowledge, no one has given serious consideration to the elimination altogether of government regulation, especially in marriage law, as a means of advancing toward a more Christian standard of living. Herein, I demonstrate that the modern Christian obsession with maintaining legal exclusivity for heterosexual marriage is misguided while the secular liberal appeal for legalization of same-sex (or gender-neutral) marriage is equally ill-conceived. Instead, a libertarian approach to the formation of families is ideal for both the Christian and the secular liberal, for it allows the Church to tighten its hold on the definition of marriage and frees the individual to pursue whatever life choices she or she wishes to make. Prevention of the legal disestablishment of marriage ultimately feeds religious complacency, weakens the marriage bond, and distracts from the pursuit of holiness; it also enslaves the free individual to the capricious whims of the secular state.', 'en_US', '', 'Baylor University theses are protected by copyright.

Liver disease has become more significant among patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. Several studies have shown that coinfected individuals develop earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin has become the therapy of choice among people with HCV alone. This is a randomized controlled study to address the safety and efficacy of a 4 week induction therapy consisting of twice-weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2a and daily ribavirin on HIV-1 and hepatitis C coinfected individuals. Twenty-two patients who are infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis will be randomized to receive peginterferon alpha-2a either twice weekly or once weekly for four weeks. They will then continue with standard weekly peginterferon for 44 more weeks. The patients will receive standard daily dose of ribavirin during the entire 48 weeks. These patients will be monitored for peginterferon level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load and CD4 counts and undergo a baseline liver biopsy and another at the end of 72 weeks. The results of the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of twice weekly peginterferon induction therapy in suppressing the hepatitis C virus in the first 4 weeks of the therapy. Since viral suppression for hepatitis C in the early phase of the combination treatment has predictive values for long term eradication",False,-1,0,,,"{2533=HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection and a viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL may be eligible for this 2-1/2 year study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, eye examination, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), liver ultrasound, and pregnancy test in women who are able to become pregnant. If a recent liver biopsy is not available, this test is done to determine the type and severity of liver disease. The patient is given a sedative before the procedure. Then, the skin in the area over the biopsy site is numbed with a local anesthetic and a needle is inserted rapidly into and out of the liver to obtain a small tissue sample. The patient remains in the hospital overnight for monitoring.}"

Juni 2015, 14 Uhr MESZ twittert der Pilot Borschberg: I really hope Joe is not going to get me!, 11588=Danach sollte die Pazifik-ÃƒÂœberquerung mit Zwischenlandung auf Hawaii (Vereinigte Staaten) erfolgen. Die China-Hawaii-Etappe galt als kritischste, da der Pilot fÃƒÂ¼nf Tage und NÃƒÂ¤chte durchfliegen musste. Auf Grund widrigen Wetters erfolgte eine Zwischenlandung in Nagoya (Japan). Bei der fast 118-stÃƒÂ¼ndigen ÃƒÂœberquerung des Pazifiks wurden jedoch die Batterien des FluggerÃƒÂ¤ts beschÃƒÂ¤digt, sodass der Flug erst im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2016 fortgesetzt werden kann., 48105=2010, 36716=Am 3. Juli 2015 gegen 16 Uhr UTC landete Borschberg planmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸig in Kalaeloa auf Oahu. Mit einer Flugzeit von 4Ã‚Â Tagen 21Ã‚Â Stunden 52Ã‚Â Minuten hat er den Rekord von Steve Fossett im Alleinflug ÃƒÂ¼bertroffen. Er musste ÃƒÂ¼ber dem Pazifik zwei Kaltfronten ÃƒÂ¼berwinden. Mit Warteschleifen betrug die zurÃƒÂ¼ckgelegte Flugstrecke 8279Ã‚Â km.[82], 2945=Rekorde in der Kategorie Solarflugzeug, die nach dem Nachtflug im Oktober 2010 vom internationalen Luftsportverband FAI ratifiziert wurden:[66], 12341=2016 ist die zweite Pazifik-Etappe von Hawaii mit dem ersten Ziel Phoenix (Vereinigte Staaten) geplant. Als weiteres Etappenziel der Nordamerika-ÃƒÂœberquerung wird ein noch unbestimmter Ort im Mittleren Westen angeflogen werden, der abhÃƒÂ¤ngig von den dann vorherrschenden Wetterbedingungen bestimmt werden wird., 47084=2012, 33405=FÃƒÂ¼r den ersten Streckenabschnitt am 9.Ã‚Â MÃƒÂ¤rz 2015 von rund 430 Kilometer vom Flughafen al-Bateen im Golfemirat Abu Dhabi nach Maskat in Oman benÃƒÂ¶tigte die Si2 mit AndrÃƒÂ© Borschberg am Steuer 13Ã‚Â Stunden und 2Ã‚Â Minuten.[75] Am Morgen des 10.Ã‚Â MÃƒÂ¤rz brach die Si2 mit Bertrand Piccard am Steuer zur zweiten Etappe vom Flughafen Maskat in das 1465Ã‚Â Kilometer entfernte indische Ahmedabad auf.[76] Der Ahmedabad Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport wurde nach knapp 16Ã‚Â Stunden Flugzeit erreicht.[77] Von dort fÃƒÂ¼hrte der dritte Flug, bei dem AndrÃƒÂ© Borschberg am Steuer saÃƒÂŸ, am 18. MÃƒÂ¤rz 2015 ÃƒÂ¼ber gut 1000 Kilometer zum Flughafen Varanasi in Indien.[78] Die vierte Etappe vom dort zum Flughafen Mandalay in Myanmar flog Bertrand Piccard am 19.

MÃƒÂ¤rz 2015 in rund 20Ã‚Â Stunden ebenfalls von Bertrand Piccard absolviert.[80], 37396=Auf dem Flug von Nagoya nach Hawaii ÃƒÂ¼berhitzten die Batterien und wurden irreversibel beschÃƒÂ¤digt, da die WÃƒÂ¤rmeabfuhr geringer war als ursprÃƒÂ¼nglich angenommen. Ihr Austausch und die Verbesserung der KÃƒÂ¼hlung wird mehrere Monate in Anspruch nehmen, sodass der nÃƒÂ¤chste Flug zur WestkÃƒÂ¼ste Amerikas fÃƒÂ¼r Anfang April 2016 angesetzt ist.[83], 9642=Am 20.Ã‚Â Januar 2015 wurde die geplante Route zur Weltumrundung der Si2 bei einer Pressekonferenz auf dem World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi bekanntgegeben., 5687=Das Flugzeug wurde von 2011 bis 2014 gebaut[4] und am 9.Ã‚Â April 2014 auf dem MilitÃƒÂ¤rflugplatz Payerne der ÃƒÂ–ffentlichkeit vorgestellt.[69] Der erfolgreiche erste Testflug erfolgte am 2.Ã‚Â Juni 2014 mit Testpilot Markus Scherdel vom Flugplatz Payerne.[70] FÃƒÂ¼r die FlÃƒÂ¼ge ÃƒÂ¼ber die Ozeane ist es besser ausgestattet, insbesondere was die mÃƒÂ¶glichen Massnahmen betrifft, welche der Pilot im Falle eines Problems treffen kann. Die Nutzlast wurde erhÃƒÂ¶ht und die Verkabelung und Avionik wasserdicht gemacht, um auch bei Regen fliegen zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Dank redundanter Systeme erhÃƒÂ¶ht sich die ZuverlÃƒÂ¤ssigkeit, durch Sauerstoffversorgung und weitere Systeme zur UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung des Piloten (einfacher Autopilot) sollen bis zu fÃƒÂ¼nftÃƒÂ¤gige FlÃƒÂ¼ge mÃƒÂ¶glich werden. Trotz grÃƒÂ¶sserem Cockpit fÃƒÂ¼r mehr Bewegungsfreiheit ist die Ausstattung aber verhÃƒÂ¤ltnismÃƒÂ¤ssig primitiv, der Pilot muss diese extreme Leistung nÃƒÂ¤mlich in einer ungeheizten Kabine ohne Druckausgleich vollbringen. Mit 72 Metern Spannweite ist die Si2 breiter als die Boeing 747 und dabei aufgrund der Leichtbauweise lediglich so schwer wie ein Mittelklassewagen. Das Flugzeug ist mit 17.000 Solarzellen bestÃƒÂ¼ckt.[71], 13283=Die Weltumrundung sollte nach der ersten Planung im Zeitraum zwischen Ende Juli und Anfang August 2015 abgeschlossen sein., 32849=Am 6. Januar 2015 wurde die Si2 auf dem MilitÃƒÂ¤rflugplatz Payerne in 25 Teile zerlegt, in den Frachtraum einer Boeing 747-400 der Firma Cargolux verladen und nach Abu Dhabi gebracht.[74] Die Zerlegung der Si2 hatte rund einen Monat gedauert. Am 19.Ã‚Â Januar 2015 war das Flugzeug bereits wieder zusammengebaut., 49411=Auf der Projektwebsite die auch den Funkkommunikation mit dem Piloten ÃƒÂ¼bertrÃƒÂ¤gt, zeigt der geografische Flugplan fÃƒÂ¼r Ã¢Â€Âžleg 8Ã¢Â€Âœ (gestartet ab 28.

Im hellen Himmelsblau darÃƒÂ¼ber ist der Flieger mit grosser Spannweite und auf und ab pendelnder Flugspur zu sehen. Rechts vor dem Flieger lockt gelb die Sonne mit einem Smiley-Lachen., 35805=Nach fast vier Wochen Wartezeit wegen ungeeigneten Wetters, startete AndrÃƒÂ© Borschberg am 28. Juni 2015 kurz nach 18 Uhr UTC, Lokalzeit frÃƒÂ¼hmorgens, in Japan zur mit Abstand lÃƒÂ¤ngsten und daher schwierigsten Etappe. Das Ziel Hawaii liegt etwa 68 LÃƒÂ¤ngengrade ostwÃƒÂ¤rts und 13 Breitengrade (auf der Nordhalbkugel) sÃƒÂ¼dwÃƒÂ¤rts entfernt. Der Plan des Teams sah eine 6960Ã‚Â km lange Flugroute wÃƒÂ¤hrend 5 Tagen (120 h) vor. Am 29. Juni 2015, um 03h29 UTC ÃƒÂ¼berschritt das Flugzeug den wetterbedingten ""Point of no return"" dieser Etappe.[81]}","{1912=Am 6. Juli 2013 um 23:09 EDT landete die Solar Impulse auf dem John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.[59][60], 3706=Die Etappen fÃƒÂ¼hrten von Mountain View (Kalifornien) ÃƒÂ¼ber Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (Arizona), Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (Texas), Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport (Missouri) und Dulles International Airport (Washington, D.C.) nach John F. Kennedy International Airport (New York City).[3][55] Der Flug startete am 3. Mai 2013 bei San Francisco.[57] Ende Juni hatte er den grÃƒÂ¶ssten Teil geschafft und war in Washington am vorletzten Punkt angekommen.[58], 12561=Im September 2010 startete der Prototyp erstmals einen Schweizer Ã¢Â€ÂžStÃƒÂ¤dteflugÃ¢Â€Âœ abseits eines MilitÃƒÂ¤rflugplatzes. Er landete auf den internationalen FlughÃƒÂ¤fen Genf, ZÃƒÂ¼rich und flog ÃƒÂ¼ber Bern und Luzern.[27][28][29], 14558=Am 7. April 2010 folgte der erste ausfÃƒÂ¼hrliche Jungfernflug in Payerne. Er dauerte etwa 1Ã‚Â½Ã‚Â Stunden, wobei der Testpilot 1200 Meter FlughÃƒÂ¶he erreichte. Die Erwartungen wurden ÃƒÂ¼bertroffen, das Flugzeug zeigte ein ÃƒÂ¤usserst stabiles Flugverhalten.[17][18][19][20], 27624=WÃƒÂ¤hrend des Projekts mÃƒÂ¶chte das Team regelmÃƒÂ¤ssig mit der ÃƒÂ–ffentlichkeit und insbesondere jungen Menschen in Verbindung treten, meinte er bereits auf der TED-Konferenz 2009.[9] Das Projekt wird von einer breiten Presseberichterstattung weltweit getragen.[10], 38569=2012, drei Jahre nach dem Erstflug in der Schweiz, gelang Solar Impulse HB-SIA der erste Interkontinentalflug eines mit Solarenergie betriebenen Flugzeuges. Vom 3.Ã‚Â Mai bis 6.Ã‚Â Juli 2013 ÃƒÂ¼berflog Solar Impulse die Vereinigten Staaten in fÃƒÂ¼nf Etappen.[1][2][3], 30514=Das Projektziel, umweltschonend fliegende Motorflugzeuge ohne Verbrauch von Brennstoff zu konstruieren, entstand, nachdem Piccard eine Nonstop-Weltumrundung im Heissluftballon Breitling Orbiter 3 im Jahr 1999 erfolgreich vollendet hatte.[6], 15149=Am 6. November 2009 verliess der Prototyp HB-SIA zum ersten Mal den Hangar des Flughafens in DÃƒÂ¼bendorf. Es wurden verschiedene Tests zu elektromagnetischen Interferenzen bei laufenden Motoren durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Am 19.Ã‚Â November legte das Flugzeug die ersten Meter auf der Startbahn aus eigener Kraft zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Der erste kurze Flug ÃƒÂ¼ber eine Distanz von 350 Metern gelang am 3.Ã‚Â Dezember 2009 und dauerte 30Ã‚Â Sekunden.[16], 22950=Die Konstruktion und der Bau des ersten Prototyps mit der Kennung HB-SIA hat 2007 begonnen. Das Ziel war, im Jahr 2010 den ersten Nachtflug durchzufÃƒÂ¼hren.[14] Das Flugzeug wurde 2009 fertiggestellt.[15], 25132=Im Juni 2007 begann der Bau des ersten Prototyps HB-SIA.[12] Sein Erstflug fand am 3.Ã‚Â Dezember 2009 auf dem MilitÃƒÂ¤rflugplatz DÃƒÂ¼bendorf statt., 9698=Der erste Interkontinentalflug eines mit Solarenergie betriebenen Flugzeuges fÃƒÂ¼hrte dann am 5.Ã‚Â Juni 2012 in rund 19Ã‚Â Stunden ÃƒÂ¼ber 830Ã‚Â Kilometer von Madrid (Spanien) nach Rabat (Marokko). Die Besatzung landete auf dem Flughafen der marokkanischen Hauptstadt.[35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] Der Besuch in Marokko ist auf Einladung der Marokkanischen Agentur fÃƒÂ¼r Solarenergie (Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, MASEN) anlÃƒÂ¤sslich des Baubeginns des solarthermischen Kraftwerks in der Provinz Ouarzazate erfolgt. Die Anlage soll im Rahmen von DESERTEC 500Ã‚Â Megawatt Solarstrom liefern und hÃƒÂ¤tte 2014 zeitgleich mit der Erdumrundung den Betrieb aufnehmen sollen.[44][45][46] Der marokkanische KÃƒÂ¶nig Mohammed VI. treibt mit der MASEN den marokkanischen Solarplan voran, der bis 2020 zwei Gigawatt Solarstrom vorsieht.[47][48][49][50] Zu diesem Zweck flog das Solarflugzeug am 21.Ã‚Â Juni von Rabat nach Ouarzazate[51] und am 30.Ã‚Â Juni zurÃƒÂ¼ck nach Rabat,[52] bevor es schliesslich am 6.Ã‚Â Juli 2012 in einem 17-stÃƒÂ¼ndigen Flug ÃƒÂ¼ber 898Ã‚Â Kilometer nach Spanien zurÃƒÂ¼ck flog.[35] Am 24.Ã‚Â Juli 2012 kehrte das Flugzeug in die Schweiz zurÃƒÂ¼ck.[53], 4357=Weil sich jedoch die Fertigstellung des HB-SIB verzÃƒÂ¶gerte, wurde mit dem HB-SIA im 2013 ein Flug ÃƒÂ¼ber die Vereinigten Staaten von der West- zur OstkÃƒÂ¼ste ÃƒÂ¼ber 5000 Kilometer unternommen (cross-country US flight).[13][55][56], 33190=Das Ziel des Projekts ist, die Menschen fÃƒÂ¼r die Notwendigkeit des Energiesparens und der Nutzung und FÃƒÂ¶rderung von erneuerbaren Energien zu sensibilisieren. Zu diesem Zweck wird angestrebt, um die Welt zu fliegen, um entsprechende Aufmerksamkeit zu erzeugen. Der Start sollte ab 2014 erfolgen, und der Flug wird in der NÃƒÂ¤he des ÃƒÂ„quators, jedoch vorwiegend ÃƒÂ¼ber der nÃƒÂ¶rdlichen HemisphÃƒÂ¤re erfolgen. FÃƒÂ¼nf Zwischenlandungen sind vorgesehen. Sie dienen dazu, den Piloten zu wechseln und der ÃƒÂ–ffentlichkeit sowie den Vertretern aus Politik und Wissenschaft das Unternehmen vorzustellen. Jeder Flugabschnitt wird drei bis vier Tage dauern, die fÃƒÂ¼r die Piloten AndrÃƒÂ© Borschberg und Bertrand Piccard maximal ertrÃƒÂ¤gliche Flugdauer. Falls das Gewicht der Batterien durch verbesserte Effizienz weiter reduziert werden kann, kÃƒÂ¶nnte das Flugzeug zwei Piloten fÃƒÂ¼r LangzeitflÃƒÂ¼ge aufnehmen. Auf diese Weise wÃƒÂ¼rde eine Non-Stop-Weltumrundung in den Bereich des MÃƒÂ¶glichen rÃƒÂ¼cken., 10318=Im Mai/Juni 2012 unternahm die HB-SIA den ersten Interkontinentalflug ÃƒÂ¼ber die Strasse von Gibraltar. Nach ihrem Start in Payerne flog sie zunÃƒÂ¤chst nach Flughafen Madrid-Barajas. Auf der ersten Etappe nach Madrid konnten zwei weitere Rekorde zur FluglÃƒÂ¤nge am StÃƒÂ¼ck aufgestellt werden: 1116 Kilometer.[34], 24756=Ab 2011 wurde an einem zweiten Prototypen HB-SIB gearbeitet. Dieser sollte neben anderen Verbesserungen auch ÃƒÂ¼ber eine Druckkabine verfÃƒÂ¼gen. Weil beim letzten Strukturtest im Juli 2012 ein FlÃƒÂ¼gelholm des Prototyps brach, verschob sich der Zeitplan der Weltumrundung. Sie findet seit dem 9.Ã‚Â MÃƒÂ¤rz 2015 in zwÃƒÂ¶lf Etappen stattÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter als geplant.[13], 37729=Von MÃƒÂ¤rz bis August 2015 sollte eine Weltumrundung in mehreren Etappen mit der HB-SIB stattfinden.[4][5] Dieser Flug musste im Juli 2015 auf Hawaii fÃƒÂ¼r etwa neun Monate unterbrochen werden., 1417=Die Ankunft nach der letzten, etwa 18-stÃƒÂ¼ndigen Etappe erfolgte wegen eines 2,5 Meter grossen Risses an der Unterseite der linken TragflÃƒÂ¤che drei Stunden frÃƒÂ¼her als geplant.[61] Insgesamt war die Solar Impulse 105Ã‚Â Stunden und 41Ã‚Â Minuten in der Luft, also knapp viereinhalb Tage. Dabei legte sie etwa 3000 Meilen, also mehr als 5600 Kilometer, zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Im Schnitt war sie 28,8Ã‚Â Knoten schnell, etwa 53Ã‚Â Kilometer in der Stunde.[62] Die HB-SIA wurde danach in den Vereinigten Staaten demontiert und am 5.Ã‚Â August 2013 mit einer B-747F der Cargolux zum MilitÃƒÂ¤rflugplatz DÃƒÂ¼bendorf gebracht. Die HB-SIA befindet sich nun dort demontiert in einem Hangar., 13840=Der erste Flug ÃƒÂ¼ber Tag und Nacht (mit 26Ã‚Â Stunden Flugzeit) und damit auch der erste Nachtflug fand vom 7. auf den 8.Ã‚Â Juli 2010 statt. Die Solar Impulse mit dem Piloten AndrÃƒÂ© Borschberg stieg dabei am Tag auf ÃƒÂ¼ber 9000 Meter und lud dabei die Akkus. Nach Sonnenuntergang sank sie in der Nacht zunÃƒÂ¤chst ohne Motoren wieder auf 1500 Meter ab, um dann mit dem Strom aus den Akkus bis zum Sonnenaufgang die HÃƒÂ¶he zu halten (Akkuladung bei Sonnenaufgang ÃƒÂ¼ber 40Ã‚Â %).[21][22][23][24][25][26] Der Prototyp stellte somit neue Rekorde unter den Solarflugzeugen auf., 11879=Der erste europÃƒÂ¤ische Flug fÃƒÂ¼hrte im Mai 2011 von Payerne in der Schweiz ÃƒÂ¼ber Frankreich, Deutschland, Luxemburg nach Belgien, um in BrÃƒÂ¼ssel zu landen.[30][31] Dort fanden einige politische GesprÃƒÂ¤che statt, die EuropÃƒÂ¤ische Kommission ist Schirmherrin des Projekts. Im Juni war die HB-SIA Ã¢Â€ÂžSpezialgastÃ¢Â€Âœ bei der Pariser Luftfahrtschau.[32][33], 25889=Am 28. November 2003 verkÃƒÂ¼ndeten Piccard und Borschberg offiziell den Beginn des Projekts, nachdem eine Studie der EidgenÃƒÂ¶ssischen Technischen Hochschule Lausanne (EPFL) die Machbarkeit bestÃƒÂ¤tigt hatte.[11] 2004 folgte die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung der Firma Solar Impulse SA. Die EPFL, die ESA und der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Flugzeughersteller Dassault Aviation konnten als Partner gewonnen werden.}"

He played in 19 Test matches and 6 One Day Internationals for England and later coached South Africa, Warwickshire and Pakistan., 30589=He was appointed coach of the Pakistan team in 2004. This came after Javed Miandad was sacked when the Pakistanis conceded a 2Ã¢Â€Â“1 Test and 3Ã¢Â€Â“2 ODI series loss on home soil to arch rivals India, their first series win there in two decades. He was feted when his team reversed the result in early 2005 on their return tour to India, drawing the Tests 1Ã¢Â€Â“1 and winning the ODI series 4Ã¢Â€Â“2. In 2005 Pakistan beat England in a home series immediately after England had beaten the Australian team in England to secure the Ashes. In the home series against India that followed, Woolmer's side were victorious in the Test series, winning it 1Ã¢Â€Â“0; however, the side lost the ODI series that followed 4Ã¢Â€Â“1. Woolmer's side then beat Sri Lanka 2Ã¢Â€Â“0 in a 3 ODI series and achieved a 3rd consecutive Test series win with a 1Ã¢Â€Â“0 win in a 2 test series with Sri Lanka., 20754=After retiring from first-class cricket in 1984, he emigrated to South Africa, where he coached cricket and hockey at high schools. He also became involved in the Avendale Cricket Club in Athlone, Cape Town. He preferred to join a 'coloured' club rather than a 'white' one in apartheid South Africa. He was an inspiration to Avendale and was instrumental in assisting the club to grow and be successful. Because of him, there is still an annual programme for a talented Avendale cricketer to spend a summer at Lord Wandsworth College in Hampshire.[6], 23335=Woolmer was known for his progressive coaching techniques. He is credited with making the reverse sweep a more popular shot for batsmen in the 1990s,[8][9] as well as being one of the first to use computer analysis, and trying to adapt the knowledge of goalkeepers to wicketkeepers in cricket.[10] He later attracted attention at the 1999 World Cup by communicating with his captain Hansie Cronje with an earpiece during matches. The practice was later banned., 19102=Woolmer was also a regular in England ODI cricket from 1972 to 1976. But Woolmer's international career stalled after he joined the World Series break-away group run by Kerry Packer. Though he appeared intermittently in the Test team up to 1981, he never recaptured the form of the mid 1970s. He also took part in the South African rebel tours of 1982, a move that effectively ended his international career.[4], 10011=On 18 March 2007, Woolmer died suddenly in Jamaica, just a few hours after the Pakistan team's unexpected elimination at the hands of Ireland in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Shortly afterwards, Jamaican police announced that they were opening a murder investigation into Woolmer's death. In November 2007, a jury in Jamaica recorded an open verdict on Woolmer's death, after deciding that there was insufficient evidence of either a criminal act or natural causes.[1], 27793=Woolmer was a strong candidate to replace David Lloyd as coach of England in 1999 but wanted a break from cricket and was reluctant to lead England in a tour of South Africa so soon after having relinquished the South Africa coach job., 36773=On 6 November, coroner Patrick Murphy asked for further tests to be carried out on samples taken from Woolmer's body following discrepancies in the toxicology reports by forensic scientists from the Caribbean and the UK.[20], 13684=Woolmer was born in the hospital across the road from the cricket ground in Kanpur, India on 14 May 1948. His father was the cricketer Clarence Woolmer, who represented United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) in the Ranji Trophy. At the age of 10, Woolmer witnessed Hanif Mohammad scoring 499, and thereby setting a world record for the highest score in first-class cricket.[2] Some 35 years later, Woolmer, as coach of Warwickshire County Cricket Club, would be watching when the county's batsman Brian Lara passed that mark, setting a new record of 501 not out.[2], 32037=In August 2006, on the eve of Pakistan's Twenty20 international against England in Bristol, Bob Woolmer was forced to defend his reputation when it was claimed Pakistani players lifted the seam of the ball when he was in charge of the team.[13] Former International Cricket Council match referee Barry Jarman alleged that during the 1997 triangular one-day tournament involving South Africa, Zimbabwe and India, a match ball, still in JarmanÃ¢Â€Â™s possession, that was confiscated after just 16 overs showed evidence of tampering by WoolmerÃ¢Â€Â™s team. Woolmer could not recall any such incident and he denied advocating ball-tampering. He also indicated that he contacted the match officials from that game who also could not recall any such incident.[13], 15716=Woolmer's first job was as a sales representative for ICI, and his first senior cricket was with the Tunbridge Wells club and with Kent's second XI. In 1967 he broke the Kentish Leagues' Bat and Trap record for most consecutive strikes between the white posts Ã¢Â€Â“ 13 in one game., 22500=Woolmer is thought to be the only man to witness both Brian Lara's innings of 501 not out against Durham in 1994 and Hanif Mohammad's 499 in Karachi in 1958.[7], 26139=At the 1999 tournament, South Africa faced Australia in the final match of the Super Six round; Australia needed to win to qualify for the semifinals, whereas South Africa had already done so. Australia boasted a superior recent record in must-win matches against South Africa. Media speculation was focused on Woolmer's team being less adept at handling high pressure situations. In the 1997/98 Australian international season, Australia had lost all four of their qualifying matches against South Africa in a triangular tournament and conceded a 1Ã¢Â€Â“0 finals series lead, before recovering to take the series 2Ã¢Â€Â“1. The Super Six match saw Australia win the match in the last over, after Herschelle Gibbs dropped Australian captain Steve Waugh in a premature celebration of a catch. Waugh went on to score an unbeaten century and score the winning runs. The semifinal rematch saw a late Australian comeback culminate in a tie, when with match scores level, South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald had a mix up, with Donald dropping his bat and being run out. As a result South Africa were eliminated due to their inferior performance in the earlier matches.[11] and Woolmer resigned., 33760=Woolmer stated in 2006 that he believed that ball-tampering should be allowed in cricket and that a modification to existing laws should be made.[14], 21807=He returned to England in 1987 to coach the second eleven at Kent.[5] He went on to coach the Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1991, the side winning the Natwest Trophy in 1993, and three out of four trophies contested the next year. He continued his success by leading Warwickshire to Natwest and County Championship success in 1995, before taking on the Post of South African National Coach., 34320=On 18 March 2007, Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica. The initial report was that Woolmer had died of a heart attack. On 22 March, Jamaican police confirmed that a murder investigation had been launched due to the circumstances of Woolmer's death, based on a report by pathologist Ere Seshaiah that Woolmer had died of asphyxia via manual strangulation. Deputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields led the investigation.[15], 29481=He later returned to Warwickshire, and gained attention when he called for the removal of a life ban on South African captain Hansie Cronje for match-fixing. Woolmer spoke openly about Cronje and match fixing in an interview on the BBC TV programme ""Panorama"" in May 2001.[12] He then worked for the International Cricket Council in helping with cricket development in countries where the sport was not well established.[10], 20247=Woolmer obtained his coaching qualification in 1968.[5], 17666=Bob Woolmer played English county cricket for Kent, initially as an all-rounder. He graduated to Test cricket with England in 1975 again, at first, as an all-rounder, having taken a hat-trick for MCC against the touring Australian cricket team with his fast-medium bowling. But he was dropped after his first Test, only reappearing in the final match of the series at The Oval where he scored 149, batting at number five, then the slowest Test century for England against Australia.[3] Further batting success followed over the next two seasons, including two further centuries against Australia in 1977. Rarely for an Englishman since the Second World War, all his Test centuries were made against Australia., 24752=He was appointed coach of South Africa in 1994. Initially his team performed poorly, losing all six matches on his first outing in Pakistan.[10] However, in the next five years, South Africa won most of their Test (10 out of 15 series) and One Day International matches (73%).[6] However, the side failed to win either the 1996 World Cup or the 1999 World Cup, despite having the highest ODI success rate among international teams in that period., 16631=In 1968, at the age of 20, Woolmer joined the Kent cricket staff and made his championship debut against Essex. His ability to move the ball about at medium-pace was ideally suited to one-day cricket at which he became a specialist. He won his county cap in 1969. Woolmer began his coaching career in South Africa in 1970Ã¢Â€Â“71 at the age of 22 and by 1975, when he made his Test debut, he had become a teacher of physical education at a prep school in Kent as well as running his own cricket school Ã¢Â€Â“ at the time one of the youngest cricket school owners anywhere., 35289=On 12 June 2007, Lucius Thomas, the commissioner of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, announced that the investigation had concluded that Bob Woolmer died of natural causes, and was not murdered as indicated by the earlier pathologist's report. Three independent pathologists' reports commissioned by the police had found that the initial conclusion of manual strangulation was incorrect, and toxicology tests found no evidence of poisoning.[16] The findings of the pathologists, and of Metropolitan Police detectives who had visited Jamaica to assist with the investigation, were reported in the weeks leading up to the announcement, which was widely expected by the time it was made. Reports suggested that Woolmer suffered from health problems including an enlarged heart and diabetes, which may have contributed to his death.[17][18][19], 25821=At the 1996 tournament on the Indian subcontinent, his team won all their preliminary group matches before succumbing to the West Indies in the quarter finals.}",

From 1949, British subjects in the United Kingdom and the remaining colonies became citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. However changes in British immigration and nationality law between 1962 and 1983 saw the creation of a separate British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC) with effect from January 1983. Citizens in most territories were stripped of full British citizenship. This was mainly to prevent a mass exodus of the citizens of Hong Kong to the UK before the agreed handover to China in 1997. Exception was made for the Falkland Islands, which had been invaded in 1982 by Argentina. Full British citizenship was soon returned to the people of Gibraltar due to their friction with Spain., 97417=Foreign affairs of the overseas territories are handled by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.

Its offshoot, Bermuda, was settled inadvertently after the wrecking of the Virginia company's flagship there in 1609, with the Virginia Company's charter extended to officially include the archipelago in 1612. St. George's town, founded in Bermuda in that year, remains the oldest continuously inhabited British settlement in the New World (with some historians stating that Ã¢Â€Â“ its formation predating the 1619 conversion of ""James Fort"" into ""Jamestown"" Ã¢Â€Â“ St. George's was actually the first successful town the English established in the New World). Bermuda and Bermudians have played important, sometimes pivotal, but generally underestimated or unacknowledged roles in the shaping of the English and British trans-Atlantic Empires. These include maritime commerce, settlement of the continent and of the West Indies, and the projection of naval power via the colony's privateers, among other areas.[34][35], 61660=With 1997 approaching, the United Kingdom and China negotiated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which led to the whole of Hong Kong becoming a ""special administrative region"" of China in 1997, subject to various conditions intended to guarantee the preservation of Hong Kong's capitalist economy and its way of life under British rule for at least 50 years after the handover.

These lamps include an arc tube with a starting electrode as well as a tubular halogen lamp which is connected in series and used to regulate the current in the arc tube. A resistor provides the current limiting for the starting electrode. Like self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps, self-ballasted metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast. In contrast to the former, these lamps usually have a clear outer bulb without a coating, making the arc tube and the halogen lamp tube clearly visible from the outside., 23066=The concept of adding metallic iodides for spectral modification (specifically: sodium - yellow, lithium - red, indium - blue, potassium and rubidium - deep red, and thallium - green) of a mercury arc discharge to create the first metal-halide lamp can be traced to patent US1025932 in 1912 by Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the ""Wizard of General Electric"".}",

Heute Nacht Oder Nie captures Raabe and company in concert in New York City, and over the course of its two discs, he delivers a period-perfect mix of early (pre-swing) jazz, pop, and Tin Pan Alley standards. In his droll but determined style, Raabe leads his band through a program that's dominated by German songs but also features his unique Teutonic take on such American classics as Ã¢Â€ÂœSingin' in the RainÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœThese Foolish Things.Ã¢Â€?

Less focused on singular tips or tricks it rather attempts to instill a more comprehensive approach to image making and manipulation that relies on Photoshop as its core. To John, Photoshop is as much a printmaking program as it is a photography program. The emphasis is to encourage the viewers to explore their creative impulses through Photoshop technique and develop a more personal vision. These episodes are generally longer than many Photoshop podcasts but the goal is to provide the equivalent of a classroom experience with a more thorough examination of the topics.

Opening","14 Songs Album Review The hard rock rawness of Buffalo's Goo Goo Dolls makes Superstar Car Wash an album that is high on amicable guitar riffs and attractive hooks, with an edge that never goes away. All the choruses are sandwiched perfectly between the crunching throttle of electric guitar and pleasing rock rhythms, changing pace and style just a notch in each of the 14 songs. Heavy but far from pretentious, songs like ""Fallin' Down,"" ""Cuz You're Gone,"" and ""We Are the Normal,"" co-written by Paul Westerberg, combine pleasing elements of rough harmonies with infectious runs of six-string grit. John Rzeznik's vocals resonate with a reckless, punk-soaked ardor that lifts their music above and beyond the norm of power pop. The attitude that surrounds the album makes the Goo Goo Dolls out to be a rough and tumble outfit, outlining all the tunes with a rebellious tone. Quite different from their platinum A Boy Named Goo album, which soun ded smoother and refined, Superstar Carwash has the band sounding loose and freewheeling, making the best of any musical misdirection. Before radio adopted their polished glimmer, they let loose and channeled their playful immaturity throughout the attractive impurity of this album.

Without measures of time preference we can neither test this theory nor understand what makes people value future events more highly. Progress in this area requires a method to infer measures of time preference from the secondary datasets used in public health and economic research. Time preference in its econometric expression is the measurable forfeiting of additional goods in the present to enjoy goods in the future. The rate of time preference varies from 0 for individuals who are indifferent between present and future consumption to infinity for individuals who have place no value on future consumption. When subjects decide to forego higher wages in the present by taking safer jobs that increase their chance of future survival they send signals about their time preference (mixed with signals about risk aversion, other job prospects, family pressures, etc.). These wage-risk tradeoffs offer scholars interested in measuring time preference the convenience of a secondary dataset, but the drawback of needing to control for the confounding and endogenous factors. This study applies econometric techniques to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to derive estimates of the levels of time preference for each labor force participant in each of 15 waves of data from 1979 to 1994. With these estimates I describe the evolution of time preference over the life course. I test the following hypotheses suggested by Becker and Mulligan (Becker and Mulligan 1997)in their theory of endogenous time preferences: 1)Age and Education reduce the rate of time preference; 2)Female gender and Father's Presence in the Home at age 14 reduce the rate of time preference; 3) Religious participation reduces the rate of time preference. Finally I show that subjects with a more immediate time preference are more likely to drink alcohol and conditional upon drinking are more more likely to drink heavily. A policy maker with a better understanding of the determinants of time preference can design better policies that empower children to value their future well-being and thereby increase present healthy behavior."", 'Submitted by Claire Twose (ctwose1@jhmi.edu) on 2006-10-08T04:09:28Z No. of bitstreams: 1 Bishai_1999.pdf: 152029 bytes, checksum: edc61790bfeb386ea34ae6f15d95a4d9 (MD5)', 'Approved for entry into archive by David Reynolds(davidr@jhu.edu) on 2006-10-09T14:03:12Z (GMT) No. of bitstreams: 1 Bishai_1999.pdf: 152029 bytes, checksum: edc61790bfeb386ea34ae6f15d95a4d9 (MD5)', 'Made available in DSpace on 2006-10-09T14:03:12Z (GMT).

This spring training, that is looking like a bad trend. Clayton Kershaw of the L.A. Dodgers was on the wrong side of it last week, as was the Colorado Rockies' reliever Rafael Betancourt. Fortunately, Betancourt was able to walk off the field under his own power. He is now 40 years old and trying to make the team in the bullpen, but this jaw contusion may make him think twice about coming back for one more season. 3/18/15: It may seem like a tired storyline, but the fact of the matter is that the success or failure of the Colorado Rockies' season is heavily reliant upon the health and productivity of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki.

He is doing pretty well in spring training this season and looks like he is having fun.

Colorado needs his offense (and a smooth transition to center field) if they are going to compete with cash-flush Dodgers, the talented Diamondbacks, and the rebuilt Giants. CarGo should be a go this season, but it would be a lot better if he is healthy in February and March so he can be dominant in August and September., 61040=The Colorado Rockies come into the 2011 season with the hope that the clubs' top young talent can begin to translate potential into success. With top players like Troy Tulowitzki, Ubaldo Jimenez and Carlos Gonzalez filling out a defensive core, the Rockies should be tough to score runs on. Their rotation of Jorge De La Rosa and Jimenez should help keeping the Rockies in games this year., 59850=The Colorado Rockies have begun the 2012 season with a rough start, going 1-3 through their first four games. Offensively, the team has looked anemic, putting up only 10 runs to support their pitching staff. On a positive note, new addition Michael Cuddyer is off to a strong start with a .333 batting average and a home run, while franchise player Troy Tulowitzki has also added a home run and three runs batted in. Right-hander Juan Nicasio leads the pitching staff with a 1.29 ERA and 4 strikeouts through the first week of the season.The team hopes to rebound with series against the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks this week., 30680=2/6/14: With the Denver Broncos being in the Super Bowl, not many people in Denver are paying attention to the Colorado Rockies. That is understandable, but it does not mean the Rockies have shut down shop by any means. They are busy building depth in an effort to get the team to the World Series. The team signed reliever Manuel Corpus as well as more bullpen depth in Nick Masset. The Masset deal is for $1.2 million in the minors with an invitation to spring training. October may be a long way off, but the Rockies are quietly putting together a pretty good team., 4076=3/18/15: It may seem like a tired storyline, but the fact of the matter is that the success or failure of the Colorado Rockies' season is heavily reliant upon the health and productivity of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. Tulo was having an MVP season in 2014 before a torn labrum ended his season and he has only averaged 88 games in the last three season. He is doing pretty well in spring training this season and looks like he is having fun. Just last weekend, he and Justin Morneau sent consecutive pitches over the wall in a 6-2 win over reigning AL champions Kansas City., 17061=7/10/14: The Rockies season got a lot tougher earlier in the season when both third baseman Nolan Arenado and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez went on the disabled list with injuries. Since then, the Rockies have fallen to fourth in the NL West, and have a double digit number of games back from the Dodgers and Giants. Arenado came back from the DL last Friday, and he has shown that he can consistently hit. Gonzalez is targeting a comeback before the All-Star break. He has been cleared for live batting practice, so getting back before July 13 may be on the optimistic side., 56688=Jonathan Sanchez continued his struggles on the 2012 season on Sunday as he led the Colorado Rockies to a 7-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Sanchez lasted just 4.1 innings, surrendering six earned runs on eight hits and two walks. He also added three strikeouts, but also allowed two home runs as he saw his earned run average balloon to 11.88 on the year. Offensively, Josh Rutledge blasted his second home run of the season in the first inning off Reds starter Matt Latos, a two run shot that accounted for the teams only runs of the game. Overall, the Rockies managed just six hits and were 0-5 with runners in scoring position., 44305=9/4/13: Now that it is September, it is time for Rockies fans to get their first glimpses of some players they may see in the future. But first, they would like to see someone they have missed for two months. Carlos Gonzalez is preparing to get back to the Rockies after missing two months with a finger injury. His loss, combined with Troy Tulowitzsky's injury earlier in the summer, essentially doomed the Rockies. Do not forget that just two months ago the Rockies were in the hunt for the NL West crown. Now is the time to assess new players and hope that next year will not be so catastrophic in terms of injuries., 53495=5/23/13: The Rockies signed veteran pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league deal with the hopes of bringing him up to the big leagues. This is not the first time Oswalt has pulled this move - he tends to skip spring training and the first half of the season and join a contender mid-season. Nice work if you can get it. However, Oswalt in 2013 is not Oswalt in 2004. Additionally, Coors field is not an ideal pitcher's park. Last, the Rockies are a decent team this year, but they are not one Roy Oswalt away from making the playoffs., 35641=12/12/13: It was not that long ago that Justin Morneau was considered one of the top talents in all of baseball. He was the AL MVP in 2006. However, he started to decline in 2009 when lost a lot of time due to a stress fracture in his back in 2009. He kept slipping over the years and was shipped to the Pirates in a trade deadline deal last season. He became a free agent after the season and just signed a two year deal to join the Rockies and revive a once promising career. The Rockies are banking on a come back as well. And the thin air in Denver should help him get his home runs up from just 17 in 2013., 51603=6/13/13: It is now the middle of June, and most people did not expect the Rockies to be in a position to make a run at the playoffs. The team is 2.5 games out of first (Arizona) and is tied with the San Francisco Giants. Most experts thought this would be a two team race between the Dodgers and Giants. The Dodgers have been snakebitten. However, the Rockies are resilient and better than advertised. The team is struggling to score runs with runners in scoring position - having gone through an 0-15 slump. But there is still a lot of baseball to be played and the Rockies do not look like they are willing to give up because they are not supposed to be there., 43751=9/12/13: There are two good reasons for the Rockies to be optimistic about the future. Sure, it is true that the team is not going anywhere and will spend September trying out their prospects. However, aside from the Dodgers, the other NL West teams do not look like they will improve much next season. Conversely, the Rockies have a lot of young guys with major league experience that have shown they can play. If Carlos Gonzalez and Tulo can stay healthy, then this could be a team to contend for the NL West title in 2014 and beyond., 36915=11/28/13: Perhaps it is just circumstance or selective reporting, but the Rockies seem more interested in putting together a contending club this offseason than in the past. There seems to be very few players that are on the not-available-to-trade list (and Troy Tulowitsky may not be one of them, though his salary probably keeps him in Colorado). The Rockies may be willing to trade Dexter Fowler, the fan-favorite center fielder. Fowler missed much of 2013 with injury, but the Seattle Mariners are reported to be interested. The Rockies, for their part, would likely be interested in a few young arms for their rotation and bullpen., 10981=10/1/14: The Rockies suffered through a tumultuous 2014 season, but alas, it is finally over. While critics may point out a number of issues with the team and organization as a whole, there are some positives. The notion that the team is heavily dependent upon a few key players is valid, and when they get hurt, the team really suffers. Troy Tulowitzki, Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez and Nathan Arenado are prime examples. However, when those guys are in the lineup, this is a good team that can compete with anyone. One final happy note: Cuddyer drove in a career high seven runs last week, something to think about as he heads into free agency., 57968=The Colorado Rockies received some good news on Thursday as it was revealed that their All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki will only miss around 6 weeks after undergoing surgery on his left groin. Tulowitzki originally injured his groin on May 30 in a game against the Houston Astros while running out a ground ball in the infield. The primary diagnosis was that Tulowitzki would miss up to 8 weeks following his surgery, but it is now expected that he will be back on the field a little bit sooner than was originally thought, which is good for the Colorado Rockies as Tulowitzki was batting .287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI before his injury., 34362=12/26/13: The Rockies signed first baseman Justin Morneau to play first base during this offseason and are banking on him coming back to life. Morneau, for many years, was one of the elite players at his position and any team would have been happy to have him. He has struggled at the major league level for the past few years after coming back from major injury. Simply put, he has not been the all-pro in the past few years as he was earlier in his career. The Rockies are banking on the thin air and relatively weak division to rejuvenate his career - which would make the Rockies a compelling team in 2014., 54686=5/9/13: The Rockies got off to a very impressive start, far better than anyone really expected. Through the first week of May, they are tied for first with the reigning World Series Champion San Francisco Giants, and are two games clear of third place Arizona. The Dodgers, who were expected to challenge the Giants are 3.5 games back. Pitchers generally do not like to throw in Denver where the thin air improves hitting. But the Rockies seem to be in this for the long haul and signed three time All-Star pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league contract. Oswalt, when on, is a great pitcher, though he got rocked last year as a member of the Texans., 61512=Colorado Rockies tickets ensure that fans see the Rockies playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rockies have their work cut out for them in a competitive National League West. With matchups with great teams like the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs throughout the season, the Rockies will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 39955=10/24/13: The Rockies made it official in the past week by formally extending manager Walt Weiss' contract. He came in as manager with a one year deal, and even though the Rockies finished at 74-88 on the season - it was an improvement over 2012. It was, however, the third straight sub-500 year for the franchise (that World Series appearance seems like decades ago now). What is more frustrating is that they continue to have a top 10 offense. Maybe that is partly the result of playing in the mountains - but it is just as likely that it is the organization's fault for not identifying, acquiring, and developing talented pitching and defenders., 62329=MLB Tickets 2013 Major League Baseball Games of the Week 2013 MLB Highlights Hottest MLB Teams Lengthy winning and losing streaks seem less likely in Major League Baseball because day to day matchups are so different and give less talented teams more opportunities to break through on a daily basis. The pitcher controls so muchÃ¢Â€Â¦, 31827=1/23/14: It looks like relief pitcher Raphael Betancourt may get his wish to play again with the Rockies. Betancourt came to Colorado in 2009 and has posted an excellent 3.08 ERA and 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings in 264 relief appearances. Of course, he is coming off of Tommy John surgery and will likely miss the first few months of the 2014 season. He said recently that he wanted to return to the Rockies and that he would retire if that did not happen. The team and player are now in talks, so a return looks very likely. Colorado and their fans are hoping that when he returns, he can help a bullpen that is in the middle of a playoff chase., 41881=10/3/13: Despite the fact that the Rockies finished the season in last place in the NL West with a 74-88 record, the team is not planning any front office changes in the offseason. Owner Dick Monfort announced that item over the weekend, though it looks like he wants to take a more hands-on approach to player trades and signings. Even with the consecutive last place finishes, the Rockies actually improved over 2012. First year manager Walt Wiess will return as well. With some player development and better health, it is not inconceivable that the team contends for a playoff spot next year., 28236=3/6/14: Two seasons ago, the Rockies were among the worst teams in the entire league and only won 64 games. They hired first time head coach Walt Weiss and improved to 74 wins last season. A nice improvement, but still seven games under 500. Actually, the Rockies were five games over 500 on June 11, but their season disintegrated with injuries to their two best players, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez. It shows just how much those guys mean to the team. For the Rockies to make it all the way to even ball, both stars will have be in the line-up more, as well as get some help from the rest of the team., 33066=1/9/14: No team is every perfect. Even the best teams have some flaws, but find ways to cover them up or reduce their impact. Teams that are said to be perfect in April rarely are perfect in October. The trick is to stay in the race and continually improve. The Rockies have room for improvement. A chief concern is starting lefthanded pitching. There is speculation that the Rockies could try to trade for Jaime Garcia of the Cardinals. Garcia missed most of 2013 with injury, but will be back to full form by spring training. He has had an ERA under 4.00 each season and is reasonably priced for the next two years., 31266=1/30/14: Considering the Seahawks are playing the Broncos in the Super Bowl, perhaps Rockies fans are a bit relieved by this revelation. Seahawks' QB Russell Wilson will have a baseball card next season, but it will be as a member of the Texas Rangers. Technically, the Rockies had Wilson's baseball rights last season, but it does not look like he is going to leave a promising pro football career. The Rangers selected Wilson as a Rule 5 player last month, so now he is under Rangers control. Russell played in Class A ball in 2010 and 2011., 7167=11/19/14: The Rockies lost free agent outfielder Michael Cuddyer to the Mets last week. With the huge asterisk denoting 'when healthy' Cuddyer is among the best hitters in all of the major leagues. He won the batting title in 2013, but has been mostly hurt for his career. Cuddyer actually admitted that he would have signed the Rockies' qualifying offer for $15.3 million for a single season if the Mets had not come calling. At least the Rockies will get draft compensation for him. The next question is if the Rockies will trade shortstop Troy Tulowitsky, as the Yankees are rumored to be interested in him., 32495=1/16/14: Many pitchers want to avoid Denver like the plague due to the high altitude which makes the ball carry further, thus making them less effective. So it is pretty rare to hear that the Rockies are the only destination of choice for a pitcher. That seems to be the case with Rafael Betancourt. Betancourt is 38 years old and rehabbing from Tommy John surgery - so he is not the ideal pitching candidate. The Rockies declined his $4.25 million option for 2014 as well. But Betancourt says that he wants to return to the organization or else retire., 30091=2/13/14: Congratulations to former Rockies' great Todd Helton. He became the first player to have his number retired by the franchise. A three-day celebration is scheduled for August 15-17 to commemorate the honor of the end of number 17 from the Rockies rotation. The only other number retired in the Rockies is No. 42, but that was retired by all of professional baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson. Helton was the 8th overall pick in 1995, and hit 369 home runs with a career batting average of .316 over 17 seasons. He is easily the best player in franchise history.}",

That followed with an emergency appendectomy last month. Colorado needs his offense (and a smooth transition to center field) if they are going to compete with cash-flush Dodgers, the talented Diamondbacks, and the rebuilt Giants.

With top players like Troy Tulowitzki, Ubaldo Jimenez and Carlos Gonzalez filling out a defensive core, the Rockies should be tough to score runs on. Their rotation of Jorge De La Rosa and Jimenez should help keeping the Rockies in games this year., 59850=The Colorado Rockies have begun the 2012 season with a rough start, going 1-3 through their first four games. Offensively, the team has looked anemic, putting up only 10 runs to support their pitching staff. On a positive note, new addition Michael Cuddyer is off to a strong start with a .333 batting average and a home run, while franchise player Troy Tulowitzki has also added a home run and three runs batted in. Right-hander Juan Nicasio leads the pitching staff with a 1.29 ERA and 4 strikeouts through the first week of the season.The team hopes to rebound with series against the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks this week., 30680=2/6/14: With the Denver Broncos being in the Super Bowl, not many people in Denver are paying attention to the Colorado Rockies. That is understandable, but it does not mean the Rockies have shut down shop by any means. They are busy building depth in an effort to get the team to the World Series. The team signed reliever Manuel Corpus as well as more bullpen depth in Nick Masset. The Masset deal is for $1.2 million in the minors with an invitation to spring training. October may be a long way off, but the Rockies are quietly putting together a pretty good team., 4076=3/18/15: It may seem like a tired storyline, but the fact of the matter is that the success or failure of the Colorado Rockies' season is heavily reliant upon the health and productivity of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. Tulo was having an MVP season in 2014 before a torn labrum ended his season and he has only averaged 88 games in the last three season. He is doing pretty well in spring training this season and looks like he is having fun. Just last weekend, he and Justin Morneau sent consecutive pitches over the wall in a 6-2 win over reigning AL champions Kansas City., 17061=7/10/14: The Rockies season got a lot tougher earlier in the season when both third baseman Nolan Arenado and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez went on the disabled list with injuries. Since then, the Rockies have fallen to fourth in the NL West, and have a double digit number of games back from the Dodgers and Giants. Arenado came back from the DL last Friday, and he has shown that he can consistently hit. Gonzalez is targeting a comeback before the All-Star break. He has been cleared for live batting practice, so getting back before July 13 may be on the optimistic side., 56688=Jonathan Sanchez continued his struggles on the 2012 season on Sunday as he led the Colorado Rockies to a 7-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Sanchez lasted just 4.1 innings, surrendering six earned runs on eight hits and two walks. He also added three strikeouts, but also allowed two home runs as he saw his earned run average balloon to 11.88 on the year. Offensively, Josh Rutledge blasted his second home run of the season in the first inning off Reds starter Matt Latos, a two run shot that accounted for the teams only runs of the game. Overall, the Rockies managed just six hits and were 0-5 with runners in scoring position., 44305=9/4/13: Now that it is September, it is time for Rockies fans to get their first glimpses of some players they may see in the future. But first, they would like to see someone they have missed for two months. Carlos Gonzalez is preparing to get back to the Rockies after missing two months with a finger injury. His loss, combined with Troy Tulowitzsky's injury earlier in the summer, essentially doomed the Rockies. Do not forget that just two months ago the Rockies were in the hunt for the NL West crown. Now is the time to assess new players and hope that next year will not be so catastrophic in terms of injuries., 53495=5/23/13: The Rockies signed veteran pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league deal with the hopes of bringing him up to the big leagues. This is not the first time Oswalt has pulled this move - he tends to skip spring training and the first half of the season and join a contender mid-season. Nice work if you can get it. However, Oswalt in 2013 is not Oswalt in 2004. Additionally, Coors field is not an ideal pitcher's park. Last, the Rockies are a decent team this year, but they are not one Roy Oswalt away from making the playoffs., 35641=12/12/13: It was not that long ago that Justin Morneau was considered one of the top talents in all of baseball. He was the AL MVP in 2006. However, he started to decline in 2009 when lost a lot of time due to a stress fracture in his back in 2009. He kept slipping over the years and was shipped to the Pirates in a trade deadline deal last season. He became a free agent after the season and just signed a two year deal to join the Rockies and revive a once promising career. The Rockies are banking on a come back as well. And the thin air in Denver should help him get his home runs up from just 17 in 2013., 51603=6/13/13: It is now the middle of June, and most people did not expect the Rockies to be in a position to make a run at the playoffs. The team is 2.5 games out of first (Arizona) and is tied with the San Francisco Giants. Most experts thought this would be a two team race between the Dodgers and Giants. The Dodgers have been snakebitten. However, the Rockies are resilient and better than advertised. The team is struggling to score runs with runners in scoring position - having gone through an 0-15 slump. But there is still a lot of baseball to be played and the Rockies do not look like they are willing to give up because they are not supposed to be there., 43751=9/12/13: There are two good reasons for the Rockies to be optimistic about the future. Sure, it is true that the team is not going anywhere and will spend September trying out their prospects. However, aside from the Dodgers, the other NL West teams do not look like they will improve much next season. Conversely, the Rockies have a lot of young guys with major league experience that have shown they can play. If Carlos Gonzalez and Tulo can stay healthy, then this could be a team to contend for the NL West title in 2014 and beyond., 36915=11/28/13: Perhaps it is just circumstance or selective reporting, but the Rockies seem more interested in putting together a contending club this offseason than in the past. There seems to be very few players that are on the not-available-to-trade list (and Troy Tulowitsky may not be one of them, though his salary probably keeps him in Colorado). The Rockies may be willing to trade Dexter Fowler, the fan-favorite center fielder. Fowler missed much of 2013 with injury, but the Seattle Mariners are reported to be interested. The Rockies, for their part, would likely be interested in a few young arms for their rotation and bullpen., 10981=10/1/14: The Rockies suffered through a tumultuous 2014 season, but alas, it is finally over. While critics may point out a number of issues with the team and organization as a whole, there are some positives. The notion that the team is heavily dependent upon a few key players is valid, and when they get hurt, the team really suffers. Troy Tulowitzki, Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez and Nathan Arenado are prime examples. However, when those guys are in the lineup, this is a good team that can compete with anyone. One final happy note: Cuddyer drove in a career high seven runs last week, something to think about as he heads into free agency., 57968=The Colorado Rockies received some good news on Thursday as it was revealed that their All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki will only miss around 6 weeks after undergoing surgery on his left groin. Tulowitzki originally injured his groin on May 30 in a game against the Houston Astros while running out a ground ball in the infield. The primary diagnosis was that Tulowitzki would miss up to 8 weeks following his surgery, but it is now expected that he will be back on the field a little bit sooner than was originally thought, which is good for the Colorado Rockies as Tulowitzki was batting .287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI before his injury., 34362=12/26/13: The Rockies signed first baseman Justin Morneau to play first base during this offseason and are banking on him coming back to life. Morneau, for many years, was one of the elite players at his position and any team would have been happy to have him. He has struggled at the major league level for the past few years after coming back from major injury. Simply put, he has not been the all-pro in the past few years as he was earlier in his career. The Rockies are banking on the thin air and relatively weak division to rejuvenate his career - which would make the Rockies a compelling team in 2014., 54686=5/9/13: The Rockies got off to a very impressive start, far better than anyone really expected. Through the first week of May, they are tied for first with the reigning World Series Champion San Francisco Giants, and are two games clear of third place Arizona. The Dodgers, who were expected to challenge the Giants are 3.5 games back. Pitchers generally do not like to throw in Denver where the thin air improves hitting. But the Rockies seem to be in this for the long haul and signed three time All-Star pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league contract. Oswalt, when on, is a great pitcher, though he got rocked last year as a member of the Texans., 61512=Colorado Rockies tickets ensure that fans see the Rockies playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rockies have their work cut out for them in a competitive National League West. With matchups with great teams like the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs throughout the season, the Rockies will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 39955=10/24/13: The Rockies made it official in the past week by formally extending manager Walt Weiss' contract. He came in as manager with a one year deal, and even though the Rockies finished at 74-88 on the season - it was an improvement over 2012. It was, however, the third straight sub-500 year for the franchise (that World Series appearance seems like decades ago now). What is more frustrating is that they continue to have a top 10 offense. Maybe that is partly the result of playing in the mountains - but it is just as likely that it is the organization's fault for not identifying, acquiring, and developing talented pitching and defenders., 62329=MLB Tickets 2013 Major League Baseball Games of the Week 2013 MLB Highlights Hottest MLB Teams Lengthy winning and losing streaks seem less likely in Major League Baseball because day to day matchups are so different and give less talented teams more opportunities to break through on a daily basis. The pitcher controls so muchÃ¢Â€Â¦, 31827=1/23/14: It looks like relief pitcher Raphael Betancourt may get his wish to play again with the Rockies. Betancourt came to Colorado in 2009 and has posted an excellent 3.08 ERA and 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings in 264 relief appearances. Of course, he is coming off of Tommy John surgery and will likely miss the first few months of the 2014 season. He said recently that he wanted to return to the Rockies and that he would retire if that did not happen. The team and player are now in talks, so a return looks very likely. Colorado and their fans are hoping that when he returns, he can help a bullpen that is in the middle of a playoff chase., 41881=10/3/13: Despite the fact that the Rockies finished the season in last place in the NL West with a 74-88 record, the team is not planning any front office changes in the offseason. Owner Dick Monfort announced that item over the weekend, though it looks like he wants to take a more hands-on approach to player trades and signings. Even with the consecutive last place finishes, the Rockies actually improved over 2012. First year manager Walt Wiess will return as well. With some player development and better health, it is not inconceivable that the team contends for a playoff spot next year., 28236=3/6/14: Two seasons ago, the Rockies were among the worst teams in the entire league and only won 64 games. They hired first time head coach Walt Weiss and improved to 74 wins last season. A nice improvement, but still seven games under 500. Actually, the Rockies were five games over 500 on June 11, but their season disintegrated with injuries to their two best players, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez. It shows just how much those guys mean to the team. For the Rockies to make it all the way to even ball, both stars will have be in the line-up more, as well as get some help from the rest of the team., 33066=1/9/14: No team is every perfect. Even the best teams have some flaws, but find ways to cover them up or reduce their impact. Teams that are said to be perfect in April rarely are perfect in October. The trick is to stay in the race and continually improve. The Rockies have room for improvement. A chief concern is starting lefthanded pitching. There is speculation that the Rockies could try to trade for Jaime Garcia of the Cardinals. Garcia missed most of 2013 with injury, but will be back to full form by spring training. He has had an ERA under 4.00 each season and is reasonably priced for the next two years., 31266=1/30/14: Considering the Seahawks are playing the Broncos in the Super Bowl, perhaps Rockies fans are a bit relieved by this revelation. Seahawks' QB Russell Wilson will have a baseball card next season, but it will be as a member of the Texas Rangers. Technically, the Rockies had Wilson's baseball rights last season, but it does not look like he is going to leave a promising pro football career. The Rangers selected Wilson as a Rule 5 player last month, so now he is under Rangers control. Russell played in Class A ball in 2010 and 2011., 7167=11/19/14: The Rockies lost free agent outfielder Michael Cuddyer to the Mets last week. With the huge asterisk denoting 'when healthy' Cuddyer is among the best hitters in all of the major leagues. He won the batting title in 2013, but has been mostly hurt for his career. Cuddyer actually admitted that he would have signed the Rockies' qualifying offer for $15.3 million for a single season if the Mets had not come calling. At least the Rockies will get draft compensation for him. The next question is if the Rockies will trade shortstop Troy Tulowitsky, as the Yankees are rumored to be interested in him., 32495=1/16/14: Many pitchers want to avoid Denver like the plague due to the high altitude which makes the ball carry further, thus making them less effective. So it is pretty rare to hear that the Rockies are the only destination of choice for a pitcher. That seems to be the case with Rafael Betancourt. Betancourt is 38 years old and rehabbing from Tommy John surgery - so he is not the ideal pitching candidate. The Rockies declined his $4.25 million option for 2014 as well. But Betancourt says that he wants to return to the organization or else retire., 30091=2/13/14: Congratulations to former Rockies' great Todd Helton. He became the first player to have his number retired by the franchise. A three-day celebration is scheduled for August 15-17 to commemorate the honor of the end of number 17 from the Rockies rotation. The only other number retired in the Rockies is No. 42, but that was retired by all of professional baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson. Helton was the 8th overall pick in 1995, and hit 369 home runs with a career batting average of .316 over 17 seasons. He is easily the best player in franchise history.}",

The Rockies play at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Grab some Rockies tickets and enjoy a game this season!, 29521=2/20/14: Carlos Gonzalez was having a career year in 2013, even climbing into the ranks of the elite players in the majors, when his season was derailed by a finger injury. That followed with an emergency appendectomy last month. Colorado needs his offense (and a smooth transition to center field) if they are going to compete with cash-flush Dodgers, the talented Diamondbacks, and the rebuilt Giants. CarGo should be a go this season, but it would be a lot better if he is healthy in February and March so he can be dominant in August and September., 61040=The Colorado Rockies come into the 2011 season with the hope that the clubs' top young talent can begin to translate potential into success. With top players like Troy Tulowitzki, Ubaldo Jimenez and Carlos Gonzalez filling out a defensive core, the Rockies should be tough to score runs on. Their rotation of Jorge De La Rosa and Jimenez should help keeping the Rockies in games this year., 59850=The Colorado Rockies have begun the 2012 season with a rough start, going 1-3 through their first four games. Offensively, the team has looked anemic, putting up only 10 runs to support their pitching staff. On a positive note, new addition Michael Cuddyer is off to a strong start with a .333 batting average and a home run, while franchise player Troy Tulowitzki has also added a home run and three runs batted in. Right-hander Juan Nicasio leads the pitching staff with a 1.29 ERA and 4 strikeouts through the first week of the season.The team hopes to rebound with series against the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks this week., 30680=2/6/14: With the Denver Broncos being in the Super Bowl, not many people in Denver are paying attention to the Colorado Rockies. That is understandable, but it does not mean the Rockies have shut down shop by any means. They are busy building depth in an effort to get the team to the World Series. The team signed reliever Manuel Corpus as well as more bullpen depth in Nick Masset. The Masset deal is for $1.2 million in the minors with an invitation to spring training. October may be a long way off, but the Rockies are quietly putting together a pretty good team., 4076=3/18/15: It may seem like a tired storyline, but the fact of the matter is that the success or failure of the Colorado Rockies' season is heavily reliant upon the health and productivity of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. Tulo was having an MVP season in 2014 before a torn labrum ended his season and he has only averaged 88 games in the last three season. He is doing pretty well in spring training this season and looks like he is having fun. Just last weekend, he and Justin Morneau sent consecutive pitches over the wall in a 6-2 win over reigning AL champions Kansas City., 17061=7/10/14: The Rockies season got a lot tougher earlier in the season when both third baseman Nolan Arenado and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez went on the disabled list with injuries. Since then, the Rockies have fallen to fourth in the NL West, and have a double digit number of games back from the Dodgers and Giants. Arenado came back from the DL last Friday, and he has shown that he can consistently hit. Gonzalez is targeting a comeback before the All-Star break. He has been cleared for live batting practice, so getting back before July 13 may be on the optimistic side., 56688=Jonathan Sanchez continued his struggles on the 2012 season on Sunday as he led the Colorado Rockies to a 7-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Sanchez lasted just 4.1 innings, surrendering six earned runs on eight hits and two walks. He also added three strikeouts, but also allowed two home runs as he saw his earned run average balloon to 11.88 on the year. Offensively, Josh Rutledge blasted his second home run of the season in the first inning off Reds starter Matt Latos, a two run shot that accounted for the teams only runs of the game. Overall, the Rockies managed just six hits and were 0-5 with runners in scoring position., 44305=9/4/13: Now that it is September, it is time for Rockies fans to get their first glimpses of some players they may see in the future. But first, they would like to see someone they have missed for two months. Carlos Gonzalez is preparing to get back to the Rockies after missing two months with a finger injury. His loss, combined with Troy Tulowitzsky's injury earlier in the summer, essentially doomed the Rockies. Do not forget that just two months ago the Rockies were in the hunt for the NL West crown. Now is the time to assess new players and hope that next year will not be so catastrophic in terms of injuries., 53495=5/23/13: The Rockies signed veteran pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league deal with the hopes of bringing him up to the big leagues. This is not the first time Oswalt has pulled this move - he tends to skip spring training and the first half of the season and join a contender mid-season. Nice work if you can get it. However, Oswalt in 2013 is not Oswalt in 2004. Additionally, Coors field is not an ideal pitcher's park. Last, the Rockies are a decent team this year, but they are not one Roy Oswalt away from making the playoffs., 35641=12/12/13: It was not that long ago that Justin Morneau was considered one of the top talents in all of baseball. He was the AL MVP in 2006. However, he started to decline in 2009 when lost a lot of time due to a stress fracture in his back in 2009. He kept slipping over the years and was shipped to the Pirates in a trade deadline deal last season. He became a free agent after the season and just signed a two year deal to join the Rockies and revive a once promising career. The Rockies are banking on a come back as well. And the thin air in Denver should help him get his home runs up from just 17 in 2013., 51603=6/13/13: It is now the middle of June, and most people did not expect the Rockies to be in a position to make a run at the playoffs. The team is 2.5 games out of first (Arizona) and is tied with the San Francisco Giants. Most experts thought this would be a two team race between the Dodgers and Giants. The Dodgers have been snakebitten. However, the Rockies are resilient and better than advertised. The team is struggling to score runs with runners in scoring position - having gone through an 0-15 slump. But there is still a lot of baseball to be played and the Rockies do not look like they are willing to give up because they are not supposed to be there., 43751=9/12/13: There are two good reasons for the Rockies to be optimistic about the future. Sure, it is true that the team is not going anywhere and will spend September trying out their prospects. However, aside from the Dodgers, the other NL West teams do not look like they will improve much next season. Conversely, the Rockies have a lot of young guys with major league experience that have shown they can play. If Carlos Gonzalez and Tulo can stay healthy, then this could be a team to contend for the NL West title in 2014 and beyond., 36915=11/28/13: Perhaps it is just circumstance or selective reporting, but the Rockies seem more interested in putting together a contending club this offseason than in the past. There seems to be very few players that are on the not-available-to-trade list (and Troy Tulowitsky may not be one of them, though his salary probably keeps him in Colorado). The Rockies may be willing to trade Dexter Fowler, the fan-favorite center fielder. Fowler missed much of 2013 with injury, but the Seattle Mariners are reported to be interested. The Rockies, for their part, would likely be interested in a few young arms for their rotation and bullpen., 10981=10/1/14: The Rockies suffered through a tumultuous 2014 season, but alas, it is finally over. While critics may point out a number of issues with the team and organization as a whole, there are some positives. The notion that the team is heavily dependent upon a few key players is valid, and when they get hurt, the team really suffers. Troy Tulowitzki, Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez and Nathan Arenado are prime examples. However, when those guys are in the lineup, this is a good team that can compete with anyone. One final happy note: Cuddyer drove in a career high seven runs last week, something to think about as he heads into free agency., 57968=The Colorado Rockies received some good news on Thursday as it was revealed that their All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki will only miss around 6 weeks after undergoing surgery on his left groin. Tulowitzki originally injured his groin on May 30 in a game against the Houston Astros while running out a ground ball in the infield. The primary diagnosis was that Tulowitzki would miss up to 8 weeks following his surgery, but it is now expected that he will be back on the field a little bit sooner than was originally thought, which is good for the Colorado Rockies as Tulowitzki was batting .287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI before his injury., 34362=12/26/13: The Rockies signed first baseman Justin Morneau to play first base during this offseason and are banking on him coming back to life. Morneau, for many years, was one of the elite players at his position and any team would have been happy to have him. He has struggled at the major league level for the past few years after coming back from major injury. Simply put, he has not been the all-pro in the past few years as he was earlier in his career. The Rockies are banking on the thin air and relatively weak division to rejuvenate his career - which would make the Rockies a compelling team in 2014., 54686=5/9/13: The Rockies got off to a very impressive start, far better than anyone really expected. Through the first week of May, they are tied for first with the reigning World Series Champion San Francisco Giants, and are two games clear of third place Arizona. The Dodgers, who were expected to challenge the Giants are 3.5 games back. Pitchers generally do not like to throw in Denver where the thin air improves hitting. But the Rockies seem to be in this for the long haul and signed three time All-Star pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league contract. Oswalt, when on, is a great pitcher, though he got rocked last year as a member of the Texans., 61512=Colorado Rockies tickets ensure that fans see the Rockies playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rockies have their work cut out for them in a competitive National League West. With matchups with great teams like the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs throughout the season, the Rockies will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 39955=10/24/13: The Rockies made it official in the past week by formally extending manager Walt Weiss' contract. He came in as manager with a one year deal, and even though the Rockies finished at 74-88 on the season - it was an improvement over 2012. It was, however, the third straight sub-500 year for the franchise (that World Series appearance seems like decades ago now). What is more frustrating is that they continue to have a top 10 offense. Maybe that is partly the result of playing in the mountains - but it is just as likely that it is the organization's fault for not identifying, acquiring, and developing talented pitching and defenders., 62329=MLB Tickets 2013 Major League Baseball Games of the Week 2013 MLB Highlights Hottest MLB Teams Lengthy winning and losing streaks seem less likely in Major League Baseball because day to day matchups are so different and give less talented teams more opportunities to break through on a daily basis. The pitcher controls so muchÃ¢Â€Â¦, 31827=1/23/14: It looks like relief pitcher Raphael Betancourt may get his wish to play again with the Rockies. Betancourt came to Colorado in 2009 and has posted an excellent 3.08 ERA and 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings in 264 relief appearances. Of course, he is coming off of Tommy John surgery and will likely miss the first few months of the 2014 season. He said recently that he wanted to return to the Rockies and that he would retire if that did not happen. The team and player are now in talks, so a return looks very likely. Colorado and their fans are hoping that when he returns, he can help a bullpen that is in the middle of a playoff chase., 41881=10/3/13: Despite the fact that the Rockies finished the season in last place in the NL West with a 74-88 record, the team is not planning any front office changes in the offseason. Owner Dick Monfort announced that item over the weekend, though it looks like he wants to take a more hands-on approach to player trades and signings. Even with the consecutive last place finishes, the Rockies actually improved over 2012. First year manager Walt Wiess will return as well. With some player development and better health, it is not inconceivable that the team contends for a playoff spot next year., 28236=3/6/14: Two seasons ago, the Rockies were among the worst teams in the entire league and only won 64 games. They hired first time head coach Walt Weiss and improved to 74 wins last season. A nice improvement, but still seven games under 500. Actually, the Rockies were five games over 500 on June 11, but their season disintegrated with injuries to their two best players, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez. It shows just how much those guys mean to the team. For the Rockies to make it all the way to even ball, both stars will have be in the line-up more, as well as get some help from the rest of the team., 33066=1/9/14: No team is every perfect. Even the best teams have some flaws, but find ways to cover them up or reduce their impact. Teams that are said to be perfect in April rarely are perfect in October. The trick is to stay in the race and continually improve. The Rockies have room for improvement. A chief concern is starting lefthanded pitching. There is speculation that the Rockies could try to trade for Jaime Garcia of the Cardinals. Garcia missed most of 2013 with injury, but will be back to full form by spring training. He has had an ERA under 4.00 each season and is reasonably priced for the next two years., 31266=1/30/14: Considering the Seahawks are playing the Broncos in the Super Bowl, perhaps Rockies fans are a bit relieved by this revelation. Seahawks' QB Russell Wilson will have a baseball card next season, but it will be as a member of the Texas Rangers. Technically, the Rockies had Wilson's baseball rights last season, but it does not look like he is going to leave a promising pro football career. The Rangers selected Wilson as a Rule 5 player last month, so now he is under Rangers control. Russell played in Class A ball in 2010 and 2011., 7167=11/19/14: The Rockies lost free agent outfielder Michael Cuddyer to the Mets last week. With the huge asterisk denoting 'when healthy' Cuddyer is among the best hitters in all of the major leagues. He won the batting title in 2013, but has been mostly hurt for his career. Cuddyer actually admitted that he would have signed the Rockies' qualifying offer for $15.3 million for a single season if the Mets had not come calling. At least the Rockies will get draft compensation for him. The next question is if the Rockies will trade shortstop Troy Tulowitsky, as the Yankees are rumored to be interested in him., 32495=1/16/14: Many pitchers want to avoid Denver like the plague due to the high altitude which makes the ball carry further, thus making them less effective. So it is pretty rare to hear that the Rockies are the only destination of choice for a pitcher. That seems to be the case with Rafael Betancourt. Betancourt is 38 years old and rehabbing from Tommy John surgery - so he is not the ideal pitching candidate. The Rockies declined his $4.25 million option for 2014 as well. But Betancourt says that he wants to return to the organization or else retire., 30091=2/13/14: Congratulations to former Rockies' great Todd Helton. He became the first player to have his number retired by the franchise. A three-day celebration is scheduled for August 15-17 to commemorate the honor of the end of number 17 from the Rockies rotation. The only other number retired in the Rockies is No. 42, but that was retired by all of professional baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson. Helton was the 8th overall pick in 1995, and hit 369 home runs with a career batting average of .316 over 17 seasons. He is easily the best player in franchise history.}",

The Rockies, established in Colorado in 1993, are trying to make their way back to the World Series after visiting for the first time back in 2007. The Rockies play at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Grab some Rockies tickets and enjoy a game this season!, 29521=2/20/14: Carlos Gonzalez was having a career year in 2013, even climbing into the ranks of the elite players in the majors, when his season was derailed by a finger injury. That followed with an emergency appendectomy last month. Colorado needs his offense (and a smooth transition to center field) if they are going to compete with cash-flush Dodgers, the talented Diamondbacks, and the rebuilt Giants. CarGo should be a go this season, but it would be a lot better if he is healthy in February and March so he can be dominant in August and September., 61040=The Colorado Rockies come into the 2011 season with the hope that the clubs' top young talent can begin to translate potential into success. With top players like Troy Tulowitzki, Ubaldo Jimenez and Carlos Gonzalez filling out a defensive core, the Rockies should be tough to score runs on. Their rotation of Jorge De La Rosa and Jimenez should help keeping the Rockies in games this year., 59850=The Colorado Rockies have begun the 2012 season with a rough start, going 1-3 through their first four games. Offensively, the team has looked anemic, putting up only 10 runs to support their pitching staff. On a positive note, new addition Michael Cuddyer is off to a strong start with a .333 batting average and a home run, while franchise player Troy Tulowitzki has also added a home run and three runs batted in. Right-hander Juan Nicasio leads the pitching staff with a 1.29 ERA and 4 strikeouts through the first week of the season.The team hopes to rebound with series against the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks this week., 30680=2/6/14: With the Denver Broncos being in the Super Bowl, not many people in Denver are paying attention to the Colorado Rockies. That is understandable, but it does not mean the Rockies have shut down shop by any means. They are busy building depth in an effort to get the team to the World Series. The team signed reliever Manuel Corpus as well as more bullpen depth in Nick Masset. The Masset deal is for $1.2 million in the minors with an invitation to spring training. October may be a long way off, but the Rockies are quietly putting together a pretty good team., 4076=3/18/15: It may seem like a tired storyline, but the fact of the matter is that the success or failure of the Colorado Rockies' season is heavily reliant upon the health and productivity of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. Tulo was having an MVP season in 2014 before a torn labrum ended his season and he has only averaged 88 games in the last three season. He is doing pretty well in spring training this season and looks like he is having fun. Just last weekend, he and Justin Morneau sent consecutive pitches over the wall in a 6-2 win over reigning AL champions Kansas City., 17061=7/10/14: The Rockies season got a lot tougher earlier in the season when both third baseman Nolan Arenado and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez went on the disabled list with injuries. Since then, the Rockies have fallen to fourth in the NL West, and have a double digit number of games back from the Dodgers and Giants. Arenado came back from the DL last Friday, and he has shown that he can consistently hit. Gonzalez is targeting a comeback before the All-Star break. He has been cleared for live batting practice, so getting back before July 13 may be on the optimistic side., 56688=Jonathan Sanchez continued his struggles on the 2012 season on Sunday as he led the Colorado Rockies to a 7-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Sanchez lasted just 4.1 innings, surrendering six earned runs on eight hits and two walks. He also added three strikeouts, but also allowed two home runs as he saw his earned run average balloon to 11.88 on the year. Offensively, Josh Rutledge blasted his second home run of the season in the first inning off Reds starter Matt Latos, a two run shot that accounted for the teams only runs of the game. Overall, the Rockies managed just six hits and were 0-5 with runners in scoring position., 44305=9/4/13: Now that it is September, it is time for Rockies fans to get their first glimpses of some players they may see in the future. But first, they would like to see someone they have missed for two months. Carlos Gonzalez is preparing to get back to the Rockies after missing two months with a finger injury. His loss, combined with Troy Tulowitzsky's injury earlier in the summer, essentially doomed the Rockies. Do not forget that just two months ago the Rockies were in the hunt for the NL West crown. Now is the time to assess new players and hope that next year will not be so catastrophic in terms of injuries., 53495=5/23/13: The Rockies signed veteran pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league deal with the hopes of bringing him up to the big leagues. This is not the first time Oswalt has pulled this move - he tends to skip spring training and the first half of the season and join a contender mid-season. Nice work if you can get it. However, Oswalt in 2013 is not Oswalt in 2004. Additionally, Coors field is not an ideal pitcher's park. Last, the Rockies are a decent team this year, but they are not one Roy Oswalt away from making the playoffs., 35641=12/12/13: It was not that long ago that Justin Morneau was considered one of the top talents in all of baseball. He was the AL MVP in 2006. However, he started to decline in 2009 when lost a lot of time due to a stress fracture in his back in 2009. He kept slipping over the years and was shipped to the Pirates in a trade deadline deal last season. He became a free agent after the season and just signed a two year deal to join the Rockies and revive a once promising career. The Rockies are banking on a come back as well. And the thin air in Denver should help him get his home runs up from just 17 in 2013., 51603=6/13/13: It is now the middle of June, and most people did not expect the Rockies to be in a position to make a run at the playoffs. The team is 2.5 games out of first (Arizona) and is tied with the San Francisco Giants. Most experts thought this would be a two team race between the Dodgers and Giants. The Dodgers have been snakebitten. However, the Rockies are resilient and better than advertised. The team is struggling to score runs with runners in scoring position - having gone through an 0-15 slump. But there is still a lot of baseball to be played and the Rockies do not look like they are willing to give up because they are not supposed to be there., 43751=9/12/13: There are two good reasons for the Rockies to be optimistic about the future. Sure, it is true that the team is not going anywhere and will spend September trying out their prospects. However, aside from the Dodgers, the other NL West teams do not look like they will improve much next season. Conversely, the Rockies have a lot of young guys with major league experience that have shown they can play. If Carlos Gonzalez and Tulo can stay healthy, then this could be a team to contend for the NL West title in 2014 and beyond., 36915=11/28/13: Perhaps it is just circumstance or selective reporting, but the Rockies seem more interested in putting together a contending club this offseason than in the past. There seems to be very few players that are on the not-available-to-trade list (and Troy Tulowitsky may not be one of them, though his salary probably keeps him in Colorado). The Rockies may be willing to trade Dexter Fowler, the fan-favorite center fielder. Fowler missed much of 2013 with injury, but the Seattle Mariners are reported to be interested. The Rockies, for their part, would likely be interested in a few young arms for their rotation and bullpen., 10981=10/1/14: The Rockies suffered through a tumultuous 2014 season, but alas, it is finally over. While critics may point out a number of issues with the team and organization as a whole, there are some positives. The notion that the team is heavily dependent upon a few key players is valid, and when they get hurt, the team really suffers. Troy Tulowitzki, Michael Cuddyer, Carlos Gomez and Nathan Arenado are prime examples. However, when those guys are in the lineup, this is a good team that can compete with anyone. One final happy note: Cuddyer drove in a career high seven runs last week, something to think about as he heads into free agency., 57968=The Colorado Rockies received some good news on Thursday as it was revealed that their All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki will only miss around 6 weeks after undergoing surgery on his left groin. Tulowitzki originally injured his groin on May 30 in a game against the Houston Astros while running out a ground ball in the infield. The primary diagnosis was that Tulowitzki would miss up to 8 weeks following his surgery, but it is now expected that he will be back on the field a little bit sooner than was originally thought, which is good for the Colorado Rockies as Tulowitzki was batting .287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI before his injury., 34362=12/26/13: The Rockies signed first baseman Justin Morneau to play first base during this offseason and are banking on him coming back to life. Morneau, for many years, was one of the elite players at his position and any team would have been happy to have him. He has struggled at the major league level for the past few years after coming back from major injury. Simply put, he has not been the all-pro in the past few years as he was earlier in his career. The Rockies are banking on the thin air and relatively weak division to rejuvenate his career - which would make the Rockies a compelling team in 2014., 54686=5/9/13: The Rockies got off to a very impressive start, far better than anyone really expected. Through the first week of May, they are tied for first with the reigning World Series Champion San Francisco Giants, and are two games clear of third place Arizona. The Dodgers, who were expected to challenge the Giants are 3.5 games back. Pitchers generally do not like to throw in Denver where the thin air improves hitting. But the Rockies seem to be in this for the long haul and signed three time All-Star pitcher Roy Oswalt to a minor league contract. Oswalt, when on, is a great pitcher, though he got rocked last year as a member of the Texans., 61512=Colorado Rockies tickets ensure that fans see the Rockies playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Rockies have their work cut out for them in a competitive National League West. With matchups with great teams like the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres and non-divisional meetings with the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs throughout the season, the Rockies will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 39955=10/24/13: The Rockies made it official in the past week by formally extending manager Walt Weiss' contract. He came in as manager with a one year deal, and even though the Rockies finished at 74-88 on the season - it was an improvement over 2012. It was, however, the third straight sub-500 year for the franchise (that World Series appearance seems like decades ago now). What is more frustrating is that they continue to have a top 10 offense. Maybe that is partly the result of playing in the mountains - but it is just as likely that it is the organization's fault for not identifying, acquiring, and developing talented pitching and defenders., 62329=MLB Tickets 2013 Major League Baseball Games of the Week 2013 MLB Highlights Hottest MLB Teams Lengthy winning and losing streaks seem less likely in Major League Baseball because day to day matchups are so different and give less talented teams more opportunities to break through on a daily basis. The pitcher controls so muchÃ¢Â€Â¦, 31827=1/23/14: It looks like relief pitcher Raphael Betancourt may get his wish to play again with the Rockies. Betancourt came to Colorado in 2009 and has posted an excellent 3.08 ERA and 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings in 264 relief appearances. Of course, he is coming off of Tommy John surgery and will likely miss the first few months of the 2014 season. He said recently that he wanted to return to the Rockies and that he would retire if that did not happen. The team and player are now in talks, so a return looks very likely. Colorado and their fans are hoping that when he returns, he can help a bullpen that is in the middle of a playoff chase., 41881=10/3/13: Despite the fact that the Rockies finished the season in last place in the NL West with a 74-88 record, the team is not planning any front office changes in the offseason. Owner Dick Monfort announced that item over the weekend, though it looks like he wants to take a more hands-on approach to player trades and signings. Even with the consecutive last place finishes, the Rockies actually improved over 2012. First year manager Walt Wiess will return as well. With some player development and better health, it is not inconceivable that the team contends for a playoff spot next year., 28236=3/6/14: Two seasons ago, the Rockies were among the worst teams in the entire league and only won 64 games. They hired first time head coach Walt Weiss and improved to 74 wins last season. A nice improvement, but still seven games under 500. Actually, the Rockies were five games over 500 on June 11, but their season disintegrated with injuries to their two best players, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and outfielder Carlos Gonzalez. It shows just how much those guys mean to the team. For the Rockies to make it all the way to even ball, both stars will have be in the line-up more, as well as get some help from the rest of the team., 33066=1/9/14: No team is every perfect. Even the best teams have some flaws, but find ways to cover them up or reduce their impact. Teams that are said to be perfect in April rarely are perfect in October. The trick is to stay in the race and continually improve. The Rockies have room for improvement. A chief concern is starting lefthanded pitching. There is speculation that the Rockies could try to trade for Jaime Garcia of the Cardinals. Garcia missed most of 2013 with injury, but will be back to full form by spring training. He has had an ERA under 4.00 each season and is reasonably priced for the next two years., 31266=1/30/14: Considering the Seahawks are playing the Broncos in the Super Bowl, perhaps Rockies fans are a bit relieved by this revelation. Seahawks' QB Russell Wilson will have a baseball card next season, but it will be as a member of the Texas Rangers. Technically, the Rockies had Wilson's baseball rights last season, but it does not look like he is going to leave a promising pro football career. The Rangers selected Wilson as a Rule 5 player last month, so now he is under Rangers control. Russell played in Class A ball in 2010 and 2011., 7167=11/19/14: The Rockies lost free agent outfielder Michael Cuddyer to the Mets last week. With the huge asterisk denoting 'when healthy' Cuddyer is among the best hitters in all of the major leagues. He won the batting title in 2013, but has been mostly hurt for his career. Cuddyer actually admitted that he would have signed the Rockies' qualifying offer for $15.3 million for a single season if the Mets had not come calling. At least the Rockies will get draft compensation for him. The next question is if the Rockies will trade shortstop Troy Tulowitsky, as the Yankees are rumored to be interested in him., 32495=1/16/14: Many pitchers want to avoid Denver like the plague due to the high altitude which makes the ball carry further, thus making them less effective. So it is pretty rare to hear that the Rockies are the only destination of choice for a pitcher. That seems to be the case with Rafael Betancourt. Betancourt is 38 years old and rehabbing from Tommy John surgery - so he is not the ideal pitching candidate. The Rockies declined his $4.25 million option for 2014 as well. But Betancourt says that he wants to return to the organization or else retire., 30091=2/13/14: Congratulations to former Rockies' great Todd Helton. He became the first player to have his number retired by the franchise. A three-day celebration is scheduled for August 15-17 to commemorate the honor of the end of number 17 from the Rockies rotation. The only other number retired in the Rockies is No. 42, but that was retired by all of professional baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson. Helton was the 8th overall pick in 1995, and hit 369 home runs with a career batting average of .316 over 17 seasons. He is easily the best player in franchise history.}",
