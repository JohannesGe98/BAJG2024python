It is a smaller school, with a nice community feel. I am, however, ready for something bigger and better. Although this school is greatly enjoyable, I am personally yearning to be part of a school with more people, more opportunities, and more entertainment. The main issue I have with KSU is the lack of majors. Since the school is still growing, many programs are not offered, and I cannot pursue my intended major of Mechanical Engineering. So, I will be moving on soon, but have enjoyed my time here very much.', ""The courses I have studied here are rigorous and numerous. General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Calculus I, II, and III, and Criminal Procedure are a few of the most challenging classes I have taken. However, the professors and fellow peers at Kennesaw are more than willing to do anything they can to help the students learn and succeed. I have enjoyed my coursework, in spite of it's difficulty, and I have learned very much from the classes and professors I have had.""]]",Kennesaw State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kennesaw-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/78702,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,6,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00088-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,913461583,913307192,HORIZONTAL,"{491969=The Greek Life is definitely growing here.

This is your life and no matter how badly your parents want you to be a heart surgeon, you can't control how you grow weak in the knees at the mention of a scalpel. You have to learn what you want and go for it. There are so many programs at KSU and you are guaranteed to find your niche. Also, we've all heard the horror stories of the girl/boy that goes to college and comes home a drunk, a drug addict, a drop out, or a parent. Cliche as it is, it's true. Don't forget some of the lessons your parents taught you. It's for your good."", ""KSU seems to have a million and one things to do. From exercise, to outdoor groups, to sororities and fraternities, to gospel choir. If you like to dress-up in medieval wear and role play, guess what? There is an entire unofficial club dedicated to just that. No matter what you like to do, you can find it at KSU. The food is pretty awesome. There's hot dogs and hamburgers, Chinese food, alfredo and spaghetti, biscuits, greens, and BBQ pork, naan and curry, tacos and spanish rice, a full length sandwich and salad bar, and a huge dessert and coffee island I only allow myself to visit once a week. And that's just dinner. Breakfast and lunch follow in a similar pattern. For upwards of $250 a semester, you're getting your moneys worth."", ""There is always something happening on campus. Especially if you are living in the dorms. Going to the events lets you meet new people and have a good time. Most events always have free food and prizes. It's a great way to get a break from the books and let loose for a while."", 'Every teacher has a different perspective. They will definitely introduce you to an alternate way of viewing the topic.

I'd even be willing to pay even more just to have a football team to help promote Kennesaw even more (KSU will be getting football in 2014). The education and experience is definitely worth the money. The dorms, however, are rather pricey! That is only because they are top notch and have several amazing residence life programs! The majority of the dorms are apartment style. Every single occupant has their own lockable rooms, so there is no sharing bunk beds! I think that majority or on-campus residents would rather have cheaper rent, though. It's a little overpriced. Their new culinary center has so many different varieties that I am always satisfied after each meal. However, the prices can be a bit outrageous. ~$7+ per meal. It is a buffet center so it's easy to get your money's worth, but for people who don't eat a lot, it can become a disadvantage."", ""Kennesaw is an amazing school that is growing significantly. When I first came here, no one from my small town had heard of it and it was a lot smaller and looked a lot different. Within the past three years that I've been here, KSU has grown so much! Several dozen students from my hometown are transferring now to Kennesaw and it is definitely a now widely known university there. There are so many plans for further growth and it's just amazing to watch how much this school is transforming. I can't begin to imagine what KSU will be like in 10 years. I do know that my degree will be worth even more with years to come! Since Kennesaw is growing at such an amazing rate, the dean or success and several campus organizations are definitely putting a lot of effort into campus activities. I've seen this grow exponentially since my first year here. There are definitely many different opportunities you can become involved in to enjoy your experience here at KSU. And the list of activities are definitely continuing to expand and the current ones are improving a lot as well!"", ""The general education courses are definitely not as intense as schools like Georgia Tech. As long as you go to the classes and take notes, it is rather simple to make straight A's in every gen. ed. course. My major specific courses are, of course, more intense yet still easy enough to make straight A's if you pay attention and study. If you're interested in learning as much as you can, it is possible to do at Kennesaw! You just have to discipline yourself to the studies instead of just doing enough to get by. My major specific college within Kennesaw is definitely the best I could attend in Georgia. I have been challenged and have learned so much to prepare myself for my career when I graduate.

The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received.

Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms.

Kennesaw is getting a football program in 2014 and there is always intramurel sports, 742066=Our student dining hall is ranked one of the highest in the nation and has even beat out those at culinary schools. We have several other dining choices on campus that accept the meal plan as well. The food is delicious and there is a good variety, by fall of 2014 we should have a new taco bar as well., 14051=KSU is rapidly growing and constantly changing - it's an exciting time to be an Owl! The dining hall, The Commons, was added in fall 2009 and a new soccer stadium (where the Atlanta Beat soccer team plays) opened in May 2010. A football team is expected in 2014. The dorms are great because you get your own bedroom regardless of which of the four communities you live in., 226638=Kennesaw has a very diverse population and is accommodating to all types of students, not just traditional high school graduates. It offers clases online for the non-traditional student who may not have time for going to campus or night classes, as well as classes starting from 7:30 am ending at 10:15pm for the students who want to come to class before or after work. There are a number of hybrid classes, and classes offered at the center for continuing education for specific certifications that don't require even being a Kennesaw student. There is a variety of major options and graduate school options so that anyone seeking almost any degree is welcomed and will be taken care of there., 566345=It varies; I remember my ENGL 1101 class was way easier than the equivalent high school course, AP Language and Composition.

They also have a session set up for adult learners in August before school starts., 609477=I've never lived on campus. I live close by, in off-campus housing. More and more off-campus housing is opening each year and the shuttle buses stop at them. From my friends places, the housing is better than other schools. You don't share bedrooms. May have to share a bathroom depending on the floor plan you choose., 319451=I commuted, so I don't have an opinion on this one. But my friends that lived on campus loved it. I have been inside them before (hanging out with friends), and they are very nice, especially the new ones. They are building even more now, since our attendance continues to explode, so I'm sure those will be state-of-the-art, environment-friendly like the other ones too! They will be available around Fall 2012, Summer 2013 I think., 318496=AWESOME dining hall. We got The Commons in 2010, and it has never disappointed. Even students with food allergies can find something tasty to eat there! And if not, the cooks are way cool that they will MAKE something for you! Sweet, huh? They are also environmentally aware. They collaborate with farmers and local growers for their food, and use water sparingly. Even the toilets have a system to cut down on water use! There are many stations- an Asian, ethnic, all-American, pizza/pasta, soul, greens/fruits, sandwich, all kinds!

Yum... seriously, good stuff., 139861=we have tons of sports and intramural activities to chose from. we have everything from tennis to camping. the only sport we don't seem to have is football, but we are planning to have a team in 2014., 104986=There are many things around campus to do, such as hookah bars, if youre into that kind of thing. In 2015 there will be a football team so tailgating will be an option. Many people hang out in each others dorms since they are so big., 571296=In 2009 I lived in the freshman housing and it was pretty decent. They kept everything clean in the building and their were monthly fire drills. KSU housing department tends to have events for students living there,for example: movie nights, parties, and casino night, so I would defiantly recommend freshman trying to find their way on their own and in college live on campus. If you do not wish to live on campus, there are many college style housing located around the campus that the B.O.B (Big Owl Bus) provides transportation to and from school., 775750=This school has everything, or at least it will by Fall 2015.

Am enjoying being here The social life in Kennesaw is so friendly. Everyone has a place where they can feel wanted and are invited to. There are a lot of Christian groups around campus that would love to help anyone make friends. There are also several nice sororities and fraternities to join.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms.

campus, they will notify you three times, even if you are not at serious risk. they will first call you, then text you, and also email you the same message so you are up to date about what is happening. there are campus police everywhere on campus, and if you happen to not be around any and you are being chased or have an emergency, there are plenty of emergency call boxes that have these buttons on them that once you press them, it will automatically call the campus police (who can call the county police) to the exact location of where you hit the button. you should never feel unsafe on this campus.', 'greek life is not a huge part of kennesaw state university. the fraternities and sororities do not own houses, but instead they have designated meeting rooms within the student center building. it is a growing organization at the school though, so i would say within fifteen years they will all own houses, but it would be farther away from campus due to the campus being in the heart of kennesaw and not having much room to expand on the main campus grounds.', 'there are many many clubs that you can join. there are a lot of religious groups that are pretty active on campus along with the fitness clubs.', 'i would say if you were a student who was wanting to have a non-traditional styled school that has been built within the city, this is a great school for them. the students should not want to be on campus as much as wanting to be around the campus seeing what the world has to offer. it is a great area to get a job and an apartment off campus, since there is a large mall and many other stores.', 'the green, which is a giant circle of grass that has a small walking track around it in the heart of campus, usually has many different people on it doing different things. people like to slack-line, which is where you take a hammock like object and tie it up in the trees around the green, and sleep in it for hours on a great sunny day. also, some people tight rope in between the trees, and many people play frisbee on the green. so the green is probably the best place to have unorganized fun on campus.', 'the school overall is pretty great for the price and location. it is a growing school, so they do have a lot more fees and will charge you for random things that you probably did not think you would have to pay for. you have access to many high tech things, and you always will have the ability to get with a free tutor and have your paper edited if you need it to have a second look by someone other than yourself.', 'kennesaw state university is in the heart of kennesaw the city. there is town center mall, which has a great variety of stores. there are also a great variation of bars, clubs, and restaurants to visit around the city. you are not far from the highway, so you can get right onto it and get to atlanta within thirty minutes. the campus has a variety of things going on, so getting involved would give you plenty of opportunities to have something to do.', ""the dining hall, the commons, is a great place to eat. as soon as you swipe your id card, you are accessible to hundreds of different options. you could eat pizza, foreign foods, southern styled food, desserts, salads, and burgers. the menus of the different types of foods always has a great variety to it. the school is very environmentally friendly, so you don't have to deal with throwing away dirty paper plates, but instead they have a state of the art washing room that power cleans all the dishes. the commons is also a great social place because everyone can get exactly what kind of food they want, yet still be with their friends."", ""i have not lived in the dorms, so i would not know how the dorm life is on a daily basis. from what i've heard, it is great to live on campus and the resident assistants are pretty relaxed about what goes on in the halls."", 'i have only had to take general education classes that everyone is required for their major, so i cannot put input on any academic classes for upper level students. with that being said, the classes are pretty easy. i have not had to take much time out of my days off campus to make sure i knew the content in my classes. if you go to lectures you will be okay, for the most part.', 'i would really look into reviews on possible professors on various websites prior to enrolling into their classes. there are many great professors, but there are more bad professors. you really do not want to take the chance and possibly have a bad professor because at that point you might as well drop out of the class altogether. usually they make it very difficult to find a way to help you out in getting your grade better.', 'kennesaw state university is not a school that feels like a

There is a very low rate of theft, sexual assault, and other dangers that are quite common on some other campuses (i.e. shootings, etc.).

Don't leave your dorm room unlocked or deadbolted unless you're inside it, don't leave your bookbag/purse/keys unattended in the Commons or library (or anywhere else, for that matter), and lock your car in the parking decks/lots (and make sure not to leave anything visible in your car that would invite someone to break in).

From what I've heard, your sorority or fraternity will become your family, and if you're living on campus, it's nice to have some kind of family that you'll see often."", ""It's impossible to count the organizations, clubs, societies, and activities to get involved in at KSU. From sororities and fraternities, to intramural sports, to the cheerleading and dance squads, to honor societies (which, by the way, do not deem you a nerd if you join - it just means you've been serious about your education and you're being rewarded for it) - there is truly something for everyone. There's even a horror movie club that shows horror movies every week. It is SO important to get involved on campus and join something - even if it's just for a resume or scholarship application, you're going to want to be a part of something, find a niche for yourself. It's a matter of taking pride in the fact that you are an important part of Owl Country, and truly enjoying your college experience, instead of considering it a grueling four or more years of hard book-hitting and academic torture. College truly will be the best years of your life."", ""Kennesaw State is a great choice for students who want to be pushed academically but still want the opportunity to get involved on campus. While the work can be hard, if you stay on top of it, you will have plenty of time to join clubs, organizations, and societies. It's also a great place for nursing students - the nursing program here at KSU is highly renowned, highly competitive, and will be very rewarding if you get in. The business and education programs are also great, and the theatre/drama department here is growing rapidly."", ""Some interesting traditions on campus include KSU Day, which is held on the campus Green, and gives students a chance to get outside in the spring and enjoy free food, games, and other activities, and celebrates KSU. There's also Cram Jam, which, as I mentioned, is a party in the Commons to kick-off finals week. As for unusual locations, there aren't many of those. Everything is fairly easy to find and access."", ""For what you pay in tuition, Kennesaw State is certainly worth the money. You will receive a fantastic education and meet incredible people. Meal plans and dorm rent are expensive and may not be for everyone (although every freshman is required to purchase a meal plan), but if you choose to live on campus, the dorms are no Motel 6. What you pay in rent gets you respectably nice living quarters. If you choose to attend KSU, don't let anyone make you feel guilty, or lame for not choosing a more popular Georgia university, such as UGA or Georgia Tech. Kennesaw State is a truly wonderful school, too, even if it doesn't receive proper recognition for it."", ""From sporting events to dance parties in the University Village to Cram Jam (the end-of-semester party held in the Commons to kick-off finals week), it's nearly impossible to be bored. The campus Green, in the middle of the campus, almost always has something going on during the warmer months of the year. If you live in the dorms, there is an endless supply of Residence Life events to go to, and I highly recommend that you go! It's an entertaining, easy way to meet new people, make friends, and get to know the RA's of the building, and there's usually always free food (and because meal plans are expensive, it's always a good idea to go to events where there's free food). There's also a good chance at many events to get free t-shirts, which are always good to have. My best advice is to NOT stay in your dorm room all the time - get out there, go to events, and enjoy all of the things that KSU has to offer. College is about having fun, too!"", ""There are so many option for food and dining at Kennesaw State. The Commons, which is the main dining hall, is the main place to eat, with different restaurants to visit, and usually, all of the food is delicious. In the Commons, you can stay as long as you want (well, until they close), eat as much as you want, and even bring your homework - it has wifi! There are also multiple coffee shops around campus, as well as a sandwich shop and Chick-Fil-A in the student Center. Next to the Commons is On The Fly, a small place to get drinks, wraps, pizza, and sandwiches, and take them with you on your way to class or back to the dorms. There's also a small cafe on the first floor of the University Village Suites, one of the freshman-exclusive dorms, and, finally, the Hoot, a restaurant in the Village (freshman dorms) that serves everything from chicken tenders and fries to funnel cake."", ""Dorm life is great at KSU, with several different dorms to room in. The dorms are themselves beautiful, and a lot of interesting and engaging events happen there. You can have your own room, or anywhere from 2 to four roommates. There can be, as with any other college's living arrangements, roommate conflicts, but that's what the RA's are there to help with. The RA's are incredible. They become some of the first friends you'll make, and they're great to go to with any questions. They have basically seen, heard, and experienced it all!"", ""Kennesaw State University is definitely a university that takes its academics seriously. Many of the classes, in order for you to do well, require regular attendance (meaning, don't miss any of you can help it, and if you do, make sure you find out what you missed!), regular studying, and a lot of reading (I cannot stress this enough. There is so much reading to do here). Most of the professors are absolutely fantastic and will help you in any way I can. KSU truly does care about its students! Some of the programs, such as the nursing program, require extremely impressive grades as well as community and extracurricular involvement to give you a better chance of getting in, but if you truly put forth the effort, you will succeed beyond your own wildest expectations (and others', as well)."", ""Do not put off turning in financial aid documents or correcting anything on them that may be wrong or missing. It is vital, once you are accepted and have set up a KSU student email address, that you check it daily, even before you start attending, because you will constantly receive important emails through that address. Do not procrastinate on anything concerning the tax returns, verification forms, or anything else they need from you. It's much less stress if you stay on top of everything. Also, apply for as many scholarships as you can, and get as much money as you can. The worst that can happen is that you have excess money, and you get a nice refund check. The last thing you want is to take out a student loan, like I did. Also, get involved on campus! Do not stay home on a constant basis. Join something, anything, and meet new people. It's such a rewarding experience to be involved on campus, and believe it or not, it's easy to make a difference not only on campus, but in the community and even in individual people's lives, by getting involved. You will have more fun and gain greater experience than you might think."", ""Kennesaw State University is a higher education institution that actually cares about its students and doesn't simply view them as tuition-paying attendees. It's a very diverse campus with students from every corner of the globe, and is accepting of any and all races, cultures, religions, and orientations. It's easy to feel at home at KSU, like you've really found a place for yourself.""]]",Kennesaw State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kennesaw-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/78702,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,48,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00088-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,913461583,913307192,HORIZONTAL,"{491969=The Greek Life is definitely growing here.

The dining hall, The Commons, was added in fall 2009 and a new soccer stadium (where the Atlanta Beat soccer team plays) opened in May 2010. A football team is expected in 2014.

They kept everything clean in the building and their were monthly fire drills. KSU housing department tends to have events for students living there,for example: movie nights, parties, and casino night, so I would defiantly recommend freshman trying to find their way on their own and in college live on campus. If you do not wish to live on campus, there are many college style housing located around the campus that the B.O.B (Big Owl Bus) provides transportation to and from school., 775750=This school has everything, or at least it will by Fall 2015. The dorms are the ridiculously high quality- even the worst dorms are better than some of the best dorms on other campuses. With the renovations and additions to so many buildings, there's no way but up from here., 773205=Those emergency buttons and call stations are everywhere, the KSU police is everywhere. They take every report seriously. I have never even once begun to feel unsafe on campus. Also, ask anyone from the class of 2017 about the fire alarms in the University Village Suites.

The low In-state tuition has allowed me to take my core classes at a very acceptable and reasonable price. The campus is beautiful and the new dining hall is very deserving of appraisal. The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received. I'm sure we will see tuition costs rise dramatically very soon, as the introduction of a football team in 2014 will be spark some increased interest in this tuition state-wide, and possibly even nation-wide., 607735=There isn't going to be a football team until Fall 2015 but there's still Homecoming.

Students pay so many fees alongside tuition, so you might as well take advantage of everything your campus has to offer. There is a student Recreation and Wellness center that is pretty outstanding, and its technically FREE (you pay for it with your tuition). You will have to pay an international fee that goes to paying for scholarships that send students on study abroad programs- so sign up for one and use YOUR money.

Kennesaw Mountain is a good hiking experience, and there's Pigeon Hill if the big mountain isn't enough for you. There are tons of events that go on on-campus, but they are usually during the day. There is a pretty good Greek-life population at Kennesaw, but there aren't that many fraternities/sororities to chose from. Nature bound is a fun club to join if you like the outdoors, and there are a ton of on-campus concerts/plays that go on throughout the semester.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment. The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester.

It is really hard to avoid all of their tasty creations and homestyle favorites. Whether you have to eat on the run or prefer to dine in, KSU Dining experience is the absolute best!

Fair warning, along with your involvement on campus...you should also make sure you've come prepared. If you come prepared and ready to learn, you will thank yourself in the long run. While KSU provides loads of fun activities to participate in, don't lose sight of your purpose. Stay focused on achieving academic success. Interact regularly with your professors.

Not only are both local county, city, and University police constantly patrolling the campus on everything from bicycles to SUV's, but there are also emergency stations located on almost every corner of the campus, using extremely bright lights to provide constant directions to the nearest emergency buttons which activate emergency services to your location immediately. The security of all the campus buildings, offices, parking lots and decks is also incredibly well managed, providing dorm buildings with card-only accessibility, gated parking lots, police patrols throughout the entire campus at all hours, and an emergency alert texting system which notifies all students of any emergencies, missing people, or campus safety drills."", 'The Greek life at Kennesaw State University is not only extremely accessible to all incoming and current students, but also very well organized and constantly growing. The culminating aim of the numerous fraternities and sororities on campus is to destroy the bad reputation of college Greek life, providing clean, wholesome, and fellowship-friendly environments for students of similar backgrounds and interests to enjoy planning events, communicating with the student body, and often sponsoring or fundraising designed to promote the self-sufficient Greek life system on campus.', 'The social and academic clubs and organizations offered to Kennesaw State University students are not only extremely well organized and managed, but also provide excellent opportunities for the students of such a large institution to meet and form relationships with other students, connecting the entire student body in a very relational way. Kennesaw offers everything from intramural sporting activities, to religious and ethnic clubs, to international seminars, and to visual and musical artistic organizations. The University has truly perfected its ability to outreach and connect to the large amount of students who attend, as well as bringing a sense of unity to commuting, international, and working students who would normally not have such opportunities at other institutions of the size and magnitude of Kennesaw State University.', 'Kennesaw State University is an excellent school for students who are passionate about studying, seeking professors and staff who enjoy their responsibility to educate future leaders, for students who wish to have access to multiple University events and sports, a simple commute to anywhere in the surrounding Atlanta area, and for those who truly enjoy the benefits of hard work and studying. Kennesaw professors and courses are designed to grow those who are motivated to learn, inspire, and lead others. The campus is also extremely family friendly and compatible for all types of working and family members seeking a college education.', 'The lawn, as it is known to students familiar with the campus, is not only the center of the main Kennesaw University Campus, but also is traditionally the place with the most activity and events on any given day. Along with the numerous amount of students simply studying or resting along the perimeter of this relatively quiet area of campus, many local bands play on the lawn as their local venue, Greek life and student clubs host special events, and the student body as a whole has been known to conduct intramural activities and hire outside entertainment to be provided to students on the University lawn.', 'In terms of academic quality, students truly receive the quality education they are paying for, yet at an affordable price. Kennesaw State University is also very cooperative to transferring students, providing credit for the majority of other college or university equivalent courses.', 'The Kennesaw area has multiple well known restaurant chains, as well as many locally owned businesses and services to take advantage of in terms of things-to-do. Visiting the conveniently located Town Center Mall provides a very clean, safe environment to shop and eat. Also available and close-by to students living on campus are the school sporting events, including state-of-the-art fields, stadiums, and courts designed to provide a great all-around experience to bother young and old athletic fans alike.', 'The dinning services at Kennesaw State University uphold excellent standards in terms of food preparation, presentation, and quality. In comparison to other Universities, Kennesaw dining goes above and beyond the required specifications, providing quality food and service throughout the entire academic year. The food itself is never tasteless, over-cooked, or dissatisfying.', 'Although I am a commuting student, I have multiple friends and acquaintances who reside in dorms at Kennesaw State University, and I have only heard great things about the condition of the units, neighbors, and services within the dorms. All of the dorm options on campus are extremely spacious, in excellent condition, and are nearly flawless in terms of aesthetics.', 'Kennesaw State University is not an easy college in terms of academia by any standards. However, like most large universities, Kennesaw also employs professors who are more focused upon providing busy work in order to advance their own research than educating the students. I have only personally encountered this once however, and it should not be considered an adequate reflection of the rigor of the University.', 'I would advise future students to study a map of the campus in order to have a general idea of buildings and classes in relation to their location and classes. I would also advise weekly meetings with each professor in order to establish a grounded student-teacher relationship. I would advice upperclassmen to consider commuting in order to save on living expenses and have the ability to work part-time off campus.', 'Kennesaw State University is a great school for commuters, study-abroad students and very technologically interactive. The campus itself is extremely clean, well staffed, and contains well qualified and dedicated professors in each field. The school does a fantastic job at making everything very accessible and student-friendly.']]",Kennesaw State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kennesaw-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/78702,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,88,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00088-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,913461583,913307192,HORIZONTAL,"{491969=The Greek Life is definitely growing here.

It's a great location and campus police are friendly, but they get the job done. Talking to an officer is great because they make you feel safe and let you know they're here for our safety. They are usually retired officers from all over so they know what they are doing. There are also RAD self defense classes available for those who want extra security."", ""My roommate is pledging, and she enjoys it. She's met quite a few people from it and I think she has no regrets. Our Greeks are deeply involved in service, but then again so is the entire KSU family. Make sure you check the fraternity and sorority website for more details."", ""The diversity of clubs and activities is frustrating because it's no way you can do them all. There's something for everyone and if not, it's easy to start. We even have a paintball team!"", ""Kennesaw is great for ALL types of students. It's still transitioning from being a commuter school, so those who like tradition may want to consider somewhere else. Or, they can do as our new club does and start tradition! The motto of the new club KSU Black and Gold is tradition begins here. Academically, KSU is great for all types of students that want to further themselves and not only get a degree, but get a career after college."", ""Our homecoming this year is for volleyball instead of the usual basketball (we're still working on getting a football team.) If you see the big round circles on the ground near the Village and the Village Suites, go to the center and clap. (Not every time, but what happens next is a sort of cool surprise.) We're currently getting ready for Monster Ball at the end of October! Make sure you explore the hidden nooks and crannies on campus, like the gazebo near the Social Sciences building. Visit for more traditions!"", ""Depending on where you're coming from, it may or may not seem expensive. I'm from Georgia, so the in state tuition and Zell Miller scholarship helped me out. This school is worth the money if you take advantage of everything you pay for. Check you're OWL express account and look at the balances. You'll see that you pay for certain fees that most people might overlook. Go to the gym, talk to your RA, attend the workshops that interest you, and excel in your classes. Now is the most important time than ever to take advantage of your education, because you're paying for it. At Kennesaw, they try to give you plenty of opportunities to get bang for your buck."", 'There is literally always something going on around campus. There is also some type of workshop, fitness class, cookout, or anything you can imagine. There are plenty of clubs to join. Students get points for going to sporting events which eventually add up to prizes. If you know the right people, the party scene is fantastic. This is not at all a party school, but all I will say is there are plenty of opportunities to party.', ""The Commons was nationally ranked or something like that, and the food is really good. Don't be afraid to try some of the different eateries. The dessert round-about is amazing, so make sure you know where the gym is. And if you every get tired of the whole burgers, fries, and pizza routine, there are other options in the Commons as well as outside. The Peace Cafe in the University Village Suites is really really really good. They can get pricey, but it is worth it. The Hoot is located in University Village and is very popular for late night eating. It's quick, they accept meal plan swipes, and everything I've had from there is good. There are also places around that give discounts with your campus ID like Wendy's, Waffle House and etc. There are plenty of options, and I don't have any complaints."", ""I LOVE my apartment. I'm in University Village, a freshman dorm, and the word dorm is an understatement. It's basically an apartment with a kitchen, furniture in the common area, and everyone gets their own bathroom. The Village Suites are slightly more traditional college style with a kitchen for the entire floor, residents share a bathroom, but they get their own room. The only problem that I hear students complain about is the wifi. Overall, I recommend looking at ksuhousing.com and visiting the school in person."", ""Classes are challenging because they wake you up to a whole new experience. It's a completely different style of teaching than most high school students are used to and requires a different type of studying. It might be hard to learn exactly what you need to understand or study from a lecture, but professors are understanding. If you make an effort in class, read the syllabus, and talk to the professor with any concerns, you should do fine."", ""Make sure you have a clear way to pay for things. Consider work study, getting a job, or do as many scholarships as possible. It's a lot more expensive than you think! If you go to the Waffle House late at night (which I'm sure you will) speak to Ms. Regina. And the wifi here isn't that great in residential areas. Visit somebody's dorm to get a real experience before making a decision about where you live. Find someone who's already been here to guide you. Get informed and get involved. You won't regret it."", ""This is a great school depending on what you're looking for. The professors and students alike are GREAT.

The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester. Am enjoying being here The social life in Kennesaw is so friendly. Everyone has a place where they can feel wanted and are invited to. There are a lot of Christian groups around campus that would love to help anyone make friends. There are also several nice sororities and fraternities to join. Am learning a lot The classes here are not overwhelming, but they are challenging and fun. The teachers I have had are very good and I understand the material.

Overall, the campus is quite safe and the police response to any issues is within minutes.', 'I do not have much experience with the Greek life on campus, but I do know that one drawback is that no common houses for each Fraternity or Sorority are allowed at KSU.

Greek life always has something planned.', 'The tuition prices are great for the quality of professors here, as well as overall experience. The only issue is if you live on campus, housing can become expensive, compared to off-campus accommodations. The meal-plan is also decently priced in respect to the unlimited food you have access to once inside the dining hall, which is named The Commons. Again, the unlimited plan is overkill and buying a smaller sub 200 meal plan is a more down-to-earth money saver.', 'The green is a nice place to relax and throw some frisbee, or even take a nice walk. Concerts and other events seem to be thrown for students every few weeks, so there is always something to look forward to! KSU also has its own wellness center equipped with a ton of exercise equipment and resources!', 'The food here is very delicious, and the only reason it did not garner 5 out of 5 stars is because it can get repetitive. Burgers and pizza every other day as alternatives to eating the gourmet flare meals, which can sometimes taste rather different, can become tiring. The food is touted to be very healthy, most of which is organic and sourced in the vicinity of Kennesaw.', 'A variety of dorms surround the campus exterior, and provide a nice place to live. The dorms are styled like apartments, and really make you feel at home. Residence life is also helpful.', ""Classes here are definitely tough. Smaller sized colleges are sometimes wrongly attributed to easy A's, but this is not one of them. Trust me, the science program is more than a challenge."", 'Living on, or at least near campus is easier than the commute, especially being in close proximity to Atlanta traffic. Do not buy the unlimited meal plan, no matter what your stomach tells you, it is not worth the extra cost in the end. Enjoy yourself when you get here!', 'Kennesaw is an up-and-coming college, growing each day in student body and size. Campus life is calmed, yet abundant.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment. The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester. Am enjoying being here The social life in Kennesaw is so friendly. Everyone has a place",True,0,0,

There are a number of hybrid classes, and classes offered at the center for continuing education for specific certifications that don't require even being a Kennesaw student.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment. The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester. Am enjoying being here The social life in Kennesaw is so friendly. Everyone has a place",True,0,0,

It is a environmental based club that does a number of out door activities and trips. There are a lot of great clubs to choose from, especially for international students!', 'Kennesaw State University is great for students that want a university feel but not to be overwhelmed by a gigantic campus. It is good for students who do not have cars either. if not living on campus, there are many close by apartment complexes that are in walking distance or may even have the B.O.B. bus stop there. It is also a great school for people who want a homey or close nit feel. the school is a good enough size that it, like i said before, feels like a university but is comfortable and easy to make friends there, and many will know each other.', ""One place you'll see everyone on a beautiful day is The Campus Green. Everyone will have brought out their hammocks and Frisbees. You may even see a few people whip out their tight ropes and have them tied to the tree trunks! There are always usuals you will see gathered around the sectioned smoking sections around campus that seem to be a hangout spot along with the small amphitheater near the social science building. Not really any strange traditions but you will get used to seeing people zoom by you on their long boards and bikes on their way to class."", 'Kennesaw is very well priced for the education that you are going to get, along with the professors and beautiful campus. Dorms are a bit more pricey but they are definitely worth the money, they come fully equipped!', 'There are a few places around Kennesaw that are fun; some good bars, Town Center Mall ( which has the owl bus access), movie theaters, Kennesaw Mountain, and Lake Acworth is close by for nice days. And atlanta isnt too far away either. But even just chilling on campus and sitting on the green is great, when the weather is nice, everyone is out here enjoying it!', 'The Commons is great, especially now that they are accommodating to more types of diets and dietary restrictions. After two semesters of living on campus and basically living off of The Commons it can get just a tad repetitive, but its still very satisfying!', 'Dorm life at KSU is truly great! They have some of THE BEST dorms in GA. Rooms are great size, clean and the whole experience is fun and new!', ""Kennesaw is a very good school, that comes with a great higher education, but that means you are going to have to work. You'll have your free time but expect to slack off like high school. Every grade is very important and can change your whole experience in a class. Study!"", ""1) Do not plan your schedule for socializing. You are at school for education, and though college is a fun time in your life, take it from some one who knows how much focusing more on your social life than classes can screw you over, that you really need to create a schedule is best for you education, first. 2) If a teacher allows extra credit, do it! Always, even if you don't think you need it. Believe me you will always benefit. 3) Take advantage of study groups and tutoring supplied on your campus. Tutoring can get very expensive, but if your school has free tutoring (which KSU does), then definitely take advantage of that! 4) Buy your books used not from your school, and at sell back time your school will usually still buy them back from you even if you bought them else where. Books purchased from campus are most of the time more expensive and you might be able to get a few extra bucks back at sell back time! 5) Research your professors before class registration and have a list AND alternate possibilities ready. And then take full advantage of drop/add. It will be you best friend those first two weeks of classes."", 'Kennesaw State University is a truly welcoming school.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment. The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester.

There are always community events occurring and so many diverse ways to get involved and meet new people. The residence halls are also very well kept and safe. There are many measures taken to ensure the safety and integrity of the residents, such as locked resident halls to anyone without a key card, and bathroom keys for every floor. Every night there are guards at each entrance to ensure the protection of students, as well. The university itself offers a wide variety of majors, minors, and general education classes for anyone to enroll. The classes are very educational, and always appropriately challenging.', ""For perhaps the first month or so of my college experience I was very upset and lonely. I did not know a single person and I wasn't getting along with my roommate. But after meeting just one person and talking to my academic advisor my whole life has changed for the better. Not only did I change rooms, but I joined my hall government and then the United Students in Residence Hall association. I have met wonderful, well-rounded people who have made my life so much better. Now I am also the Director of Internal Affairs for that organization and get to personally help many new freshman along with returning students. But UW Oshkosh offers so much more than great friends, it offers a great education. My classes are always enjoyable thanks to my up beat teachers and staff. It is also a very safe, community aware neighborhood. The campus is small enough that everyone is united and you can always walk down the street to visit friends or go shopping."", 'Coming from a small, private high school in Milwaukee, I did not know what to expect from my college classes. I was stunned to learn how diverse all of my classes are and how easy it is to understand my lessons. Whenever I do have difficulty with a class, my professors have always been there to help explain what it is that I am not understanding. None of my classes have been too challenging, but they have never been too difficult, either. All the professors are also very animated and make the class enjoyable and interesting.']]",University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Oshkosh/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/122711,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00088-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,913548623,913486147,HORIZONTAL,"{27967=My name is Starlisha J Williams and I am in the eleventh grade at Madison high school in Milwaukee WI.

Also, at Reeve Memorial, they are very picky at what you can add on to your meal. For example, at Titan Tacos, if you didn't want tomatos but wanted to add sour cream, they won't let you unless they charge you extra.

After touring other UW schools I found that for the amount I am paying I am receiving a much better education than other more expensive schools. Financial aide is readily available & often times students receive more money than needed. Am enjoying being here Oshkosh has something for everyone, whether you like sports, on campus clubs, or just relaxing there is something here for everyone. You will have no problem fitting in, especially if you choose to get involved in some way. Living in the dorms is pretty sweet too. The CA's are super helpful, as well as the rest of the Residence Life staff. The transition from high school to college is a breeze, especially at UW-O. Am learning a lot By having a mixture in class size I am beginning to see what works best for me. Pit classes are generally the hardest to learn in, but having a great professor makes things a lot easier. Professors are generally easy going & really are here to help you learn. They strive to learn your names & enjoy answering questions you may have. Login to",True,0,0,
