"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""As stated before, if you want a wild life, this isn't for you. There are parties, yes, but there are no resources for wild stuff, this school is designed to be quiet and help you be quiet but successful student. If you're like me, and you like the idea of going to school to learn and you're okay with having to study, but like bouts of fun, too, then go here. My ideal night is a few hours of fun (whether that's at the pool, at the party, or at the Starbucks) and a bit of quiet time to relax or study, and this school is perfect for that. Take into account that it isn't only the school that's quiet, it's the town of Nacogdoches, which is a pretty conservative town. So behave! And good luck!"", ""I know you've probably already heard this, in reference to your junior year or future college career, but you've probably heard it only from your parents or counselors, who went to college 20 years ago. But honestly, and really, do not let the work build up. Every time someone said that to me, I figured they were just talking about the college student who goes to school to party. I'm not that student, I'm the student who goes to learn, and I thought I would know better than these people telling me to study every day. I'm a hardworking student, but the kind that figures out what works best for her after spending some time in every new situation. I encourage that, but really, and as much as you've heard this before: When you're up at 3am studying and you have a final in five hours, you're gonna know that there was something else you could have done instead going to Marble Slab or that party or whatever. Even if you don't want to take this to heart, at least promise yourself, that if you're not going to be the person who studies all day, do at least one-to-two hours more than you normally. Not all day, and not even consecutively, but that little extra ounce of work goes a long way. Also, if you don't like your professor, this time, there's nothing you can do about it. You can drop the class, but if you don't , you're stuck with him/her and if you feel they're not treating you right, you can't go to the counselor to complain and make sure you don't fail. Hardly no one is running an interference with these professors, and you better be good from day one, because if you think you're the professor is the kind who will reflect their personal opinion of you in their grade, they probably will and no one will stop them. Not to say that they are all scary like the movies and TV shows portray. Before I went to SFA, I was expecting all professors to make it clear from day one that you are nothing to them but an inconvenience and that they expect you to stay in line, or they will fail you and kill you, so to speak. That's not true. A lot of them rule with a tight fist, yes, but no one is a professor if they don't want to help. Remember that you have to go through a lot of school to be a professor, so you're more likely to run in to bitter high-school teachers that want to make your life miserable. No professor doesn't want you to do well, so treat them with respect, and they will to. But yeah, you'll get that occasional pain-in-the-butt teacher, and yes, you do have to play nice."", ""Considering that I pay around 14k at SFA for tuition, which includes a meal plan (which keeps me well-covered) and for the cheapest dorm possible, I'd say I get bang for my buck. Though I will not stay in my particular dorm any longer once possible, again, it's not as if I was miserable. It was definitely liveable, but I've been to the other dorms and they're just plain nicer. Considering that the gym and library AND tutoring is considered in tuition, it's a pretty sweet deal. The AARC (tutoring center) is open Sun-Fri until about 1am, and you can be a walk-in, or, if you sign up early enough, you can get a private tutor. And it's all free, like the gym, as previously stated. The meal plans all cost the same, but you can get different variations. There's one, the 7/14plan, that gives you two meals a day along with $125 Dining Dollars a semester, which is basically a debit card for places like the on-campus Starbucks, Chick-Fa-Le or etc. I've never gone to the cafeteria more than two times a day, so I recommend this one, especially since they have an awesome place, the Einstein Bagel Bros. in the library where I love to waste my dining dollars before class. If you're a cafeteria person, you can get the 7/20 plan that gives you three meals a day at the cafeteria and $50 dining dollars for one semester."", ""If you want a huge school with lots of actions, you may want to look elsewhere. There are certainly parties and plenty of sororities, fraternities, and other organizations, but it's a very quiet, low-key school. I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help. Considering that it's a pretty large student ratio, it's kind of amazing how helpful and patient everyone is."", ""Four out of five of my classes, and I'm ignoring my math class because it's not my strong point, had teachers that were not afraid to engage with you and make sure you know what you needed and wanted to know. When I feel like a teacher wants me to learn because they really want you to, not just because it makes their paychecks better, it makes me WANT to learn and I can safely say, that those four teachers this semester were really awesome and treated me with great respect. I didn't feel like a kid, I felt like a student. When you're in high school, you feel like you're being babysat, don't you? Well in my first semester at SFA, I felt like I was for once learning something relevant and I felt encouraged to do my best. Earlier I said that four out of my five of my teachers this semester helped me achieve great heights, and that's because I'm not going to lie to you about that fifth teacher. I'm very bad in math, so bad I had to take remedial and I almost failed. That being said, large part of it was due to my teacher hardly being an English-speaker. He was foreign and had terrible English, and I think if you have a group of students that need a lot of help in a certain subject, you don't give them the worst teacher in the school. SFA has a notoriously horrible math department and this proved the case. Don't be too discouraged, though (unless you're going in to math, of course), because the teaching, nursing and forestry programs are pretty kick-ass, they're the reason the school is there.""]]",Stephen F Austin State University (SFA) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Stephen-F-Austin-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/66979,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,3,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00264-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900810351,900699765,HORIZONTAL,"{145974=Not too bad.

So as a responsible student just simply study. Study and review little by little everyday so when tests come, things won't feel so overwhelming and feel like it's the end of the world. Also be aware that there are cruel people in this world, and it is best not to trust anyone too quickly.

Teachers go out of their time to give their students all the tools to make good grades, not just good, but excellent.

My professors would sit down with me in their office and explain my possibilities of making a B, or A and tell me ways I could prepare more to ensure I got what I wanted. They were patient and truly wonderful. I never felt left alone or uncomfortable. We even planned times where I would come in and review with them material that I didn't fully comprehend in class.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E.

But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E.

The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me.

The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out.

These services are free and on campus for easy access.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

Also, go to SI study groups, they help a lot as well! Student Instructor are student who have taken the class and passed with an A. They talk to the professor and give study guides to the student and help you complete them. They answer any question that you might have during study groups or possibly in class. Also, take advantage of as many services as you can because they are all free! The Recreation Center offers weight machines, a running track, in door and out door volleyball and basketball, a rock-climbing wall, cycling rooms, aerobic classes, walliball, racketball, and an outdoor heated swimming pool which is all free!

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access.

I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

And don't forget, year around free passes to all sports games. Am enjoying being here The student life at SFA is amazing. There's always something going on and something for everyone. There's clubs you never knew existed and even the opportunity to create your own. There's a wide range of athletic events, especially this year when I heard there's going to be a bowling team. There's tremendous community support, job opportunities, and just a cool small college town to be in there. Am learning a lot Being at this school has been a great opportunity. The teachers are always available to talk about a test, your grades, or just about the subject in general. Since I've been at SFA, I've visited all my professors and they have all helped me to improve my performance in class by giving me tips and helping me understand the material. I",True,0,0,

I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

Meal plan is very expensive. (1550 a semester...ridiculous), 16858=If you want a huge school with lots of actions, you may want to look elsewhere. There are certainly parties and plenty of sororities, fraternities, and other organizations, but it's a very quiet, low-key school. I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access.

There are certainly parties and plenty of sororities, fraternities, and other organizations, but it's a very quiet, low-key school. I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

School spirit is high at this school. The football games are live and exciting as well as the basketbal games. Also, off campus there are a few night clubs.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

Tips for prospective students USE THE AARC! The AARC, in my opinion, is the best thing located on campus! Its free and you have help with classes.

They talk to the professor and give study guides to the student and help you complete them. They answer any question that you might have during study groups or possibly in class. Also, take advantage of as many services as you can because they are all free! The Recreation Center offers weight machines, a running track, in door and out door volleyball and basketball, a rock-climbing wall, cycling rooms, aerobic classes, walliball, racketball, and an outdoor heated swimming pool which is all free!

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you.

The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E.

The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

From our folklore fear of stepping into the Stone Fort on the edge of campus (if you do, superstition has it that you won't graduate) to our purple spirit (wear a purple shirt and sit in the purple out section of the football stands), SFA doesn't lack school spirit and tradition.

You'll get to be in classes with knowledgeable professors, but without too hard of a workload that might prevent you from making friends and doing activities. More important than the classes though, I would say are the experiences that SFA can offer.

I've heard that the wide selection at SFA (there's always an option of sandwiches, pizza, 'junk'-ier food (i.e. hamburgers, chicken patty sandwiches, hotdogs, etc.), or home-cooked food) is excellent compared to other schools, but, as with anything, after you eat it day after day, it tends to get old."", ""SFA has a committed residence hall association that works to offer many different programs and activities in the various dorms, though, if you're not interested, you're not required to attend. I've loved both the dorms I've lived in (Lumberjack Landing and Wisely Hall), but, of course, it's sure to vary some depending on which dorm you live in."", ""Classes are not very academically rigorous here if you have a well-rounded background and a decent work ethic; however, if you're a struggling student, they'll help you build up that background knowledge and work ethic, providing you with lots of support along the way. Also, though classes aren't always challenging, they often offer a more practical side to academics (i.e. field-experience)."", ""If you're deciding between another school and SFA, wait before deciding. SFA is one of the slowest schools to get scholarship information out, but they also tend to give out a lot of scholarship money. Also, visit the campus and talk to professors from the major (or majors) you're considering at Showcase Saturday. It'll give you a better idea if SFA is going to be the place for you."", ""SFA is known for its beautiful campus, but it also hosts helpful professors and friendly students.

But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out.

I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access. The learning ability at this school is magnificent and every student should take advantage of the fact that the classes are small and the professors desire to help every student.

There are certainly parties and plenty of sororities, fraternities, and other organizations, but it's a very quiet, low-key school. I'm not a huge party-animal, and by that I mean for entertainment, I go to Marble Slab and the movies. Occasionally, I DO go to a bar or club or something active. But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me. I'm the only person in my family to go to a university and I've been really overwhelmed by all that I have to do keep my funds coming in and such, and I've had ask some really basic questions that I should have known before, and no one has ever made me feel unwelcomed or like they didn't want to help.

The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access.

The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E.

The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has.

But to be honest, if you're a serious student, you don't need an active party life. While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school. Everywhere you walk, there's flowers and beautiful, full green trees sheltering you and looking out at in the fall at the orange trees covering the huge hills is nothing short of breathtaking. Not to mention, I've no had no one act like they didn't want to help me.

Austin State University the education that is offered is superb. The question is are you able to go the extra mile in order to give yourself the highest degree of education. The professors do their job in order to supply you with appropriate information in order to be successful. But if the homework is not done, or the appropriate study skills are not utilized then your pretty much out of luck unless your a genius. The school offers many services in order to help you out. For example the AARC (Academic Assistance and Resource Center) offers peer to peer tutoring, specified subject walk-in tables, and Sudent Instructor peer groups for specific classes. These services are free and on campus for easy access.

The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you. Have you seen the pool? It's a pretty large space and, get ready for this, has a lazy river. It doesn't look like a hole in the concrete, either. It looks like a lagoon and is purely beautiful at night. Only an hour there and I feel greatly relaxed. If you DO want to work out, the gym is H-U-G-E. Machines, machines, machines, AND they have cable TVs on them, so you can watch and work out. Did I mention the rock climbing wall? As for the dorms, they aren't great, honestly. The most expensive ones, about $4800, have a kitchen, with a microwave and full-sized fridge, private bathroom with two sinks, living room with a couch, and two private bedrooms. They rock. But the cheapest, Hall 14&16, where I'm at, sadly enough, ha ha, is $1400 and I absolutely will be relocating ASAP. Not that I had huge troubles this past semester. The rooms are just big enough for a pack rat like me to live in, but the community bathrooms are only cleaned once a day, and if something happens after they clean in the morning, you have to look at it all day. Yeah, gross. Not to mention the halls look like an asylum, and there's not a pool table or ping pong table like every other dorm has. But there are meetings in the hall designed for study tips and other activities to help benefit you at school. My trips back and forth from buildings isn't bad, either. I can get anywhere in about five to ten minutes, and even if it is hot or cold or miserable, it's a beautiful walk. SFA spends more on landscaping (2 million a year) than any other Texan school.

School spirit is high at this school. The football games are live and exciting as well as the basketbal games. Also, off campus there are a few night clubs.

While the work load wasn't a killer, I was definitely spending at least half of my free time doing homework, if not more. The good thing about SFA and the small town of Nacogdoches is, if you need a few free hours and then to get back home soon to do school work, you don't have to go far. There are several forms of entertainment on campus. One being the student center, which has a pool table, Starbucks, and lots of eating options. Although most of these close early (with the exception of the pool table lounge), there is still a little store and lots of sitting areas if you need a new place to study and sip on a coke. The best thing to do on campus for fun is the gym. I know, I know, so many of us roll our eyes when we hear this, but you if you don't want to work out, the gym is still a place for you.

Often when I sit down for lunch, at least one person has something interesting that they learned about in class recently that starts a discussion among the table.

Unless you get wrapped up into the sorority life and want to attend frat parties every weekend, or unless you are 21 there really isnt much to do.

For the amount of time that it has been around, it would be easy to assume that it was filthy inside.

We have our own police force, but not very many of them are on duty at night, and that's when things usually happen. There have been robberies and indecent exposure semi-frequently in the last year, but a lot of that comes from the fact that UK has an open campus. There were shots fired near campus a couple times, but not on it. There was also a report of one girl being raped this year in her dorm, but it was by someone she brought in with her. The dorms all have doors that automatically lock, and you have to swipe your ID to get in if you live there. You have to check in any guests, and they leave their IDs in case anything was to happen. The other buildings on campus have similar restrictions after normal hours. There is a service that will have someone drive you back to your dorm if you're out alone at night, and you can always call them if you feel uncomfortable out by yourself. I, myself, have never felt unsafe on campus, but I know that things have happened to other students."", ""I'm not involved in Greek life, so I can't say much about it, except that some organizations are good and some are not. You have to be careful about which one you choose. For sororities, it's mostly pretty good, except that some have reputations for being promiscuous or big partiers. For guys, there is hazing; they say there isn't, but they lie. I lived in a fraternity house that the university reclaimed because SAE got kicked off campus for 2 years for setting someone on fire, and there were cages in the basement where they would haze the rushes. It's amazing what they have to do if they want to get their girlfriends letters or a ring."", ""There are tons of clubs and activities on campus that you can get involved in, and if we don't have the one you want, you can make your own as long as you have a faculty supervisor to vouch for you. There are academic clubs, ethnic clubs, pre-professional clubs, stomp teams, club sports, and we even have ultimate frisbee."", ""Students who don't need a lot of personal attention will love it here. You can always get help from either teachers or peer tutors when you need it, but the teacher doesn't bother with making sure you're doing everything. The anonymity is especially nice if you learn better on your own and don't want to come to class all the time."", ""We have the world's largest water balloon fight during K Week (first week of class)."", ""I think it's really expensive. I'm pretty sure it's the most expensive public school in the state, but it's also the best quality as far as professors and the education you receive."", ""There's quite a bit to do here. In spring, there's Keeneland, which is a horse race track. We have a movie tavern on Richmond Road. Typical bars and clubs downtown. Bowling, new trampoline park. If you just want to stay on campus, there's a rock wall in the Johnson Center, and the Student Activities Board always has something going on. There's also Comedy Caravan on Wednesdays and free Late Night Film Series showings on Thursdays and Fridays, generally. There are other events that go on sporadically, and there are always posters up everywhere. There's no excuse to get bored here."", ""It depends on where you go on campus, but most of the food is pretty good everywhere. The buffet on south campus (Commons) isn't great, but you can get as much food as you want. The rest of the restaurants that are UK run are pretty good: there's one at the library (Ovid's), a cafe in the Business building (Blue Chips), another buffet on north campus (Blazer), and one in the student center (Ovid's Express). There are also chain places in the student center (Subway, Chik Fil A and Panda Express). Additionally, there are several places close to north campus that are easily accessible (Arby's, McDonald's, Jimmy Johns, Pazzo's, Cane's, Fazoli's, Smashburger, Jamba Juice, Firehouse Subs)."", ""Again, it really depends on which dorm you're assigned. There are some new dorms that are pretty recent and some that are going up right now, but the older dorms (Blanding and Kirwan dorms) are not so great. The new dorms are suite style, so you don't have to share your bathroom with so many people, and the furniture and halls are quite nice. The older dorms are small and the furniture isn't so nice, the walls are really thin, and you have to share bathrooms with the entire floor."", ""I think it really depends on what classes you take, and what major you choose, but my classes are fairly difficult. In my upper-level courses, I've never had an experience where I could just drift through. You have to be actively engaged in your classes, and a lot of them require attendance regardless, so it's not that hard. The challenge of the work doesn't bother me because I know I'm getting a quality education in return."", 'Get involved in a club, sport, or other activity. UK is a large school, but being involved in something smaller makes it not so daunting. Additionally, making friends and networking are always a plus when you come to college.', 'For a Kentucky university, UK is quite large. It can be overwhelming here if you are not the type of person to speak up and be heard because there are simply so many people, especially in the entry-level courses. Academically speaking, it is a good school with good programs and many teachers that are willing to work with you, so as long as you can get involved and learn how to stand out a bit, you will be just fine here.']]",University of Kentucky (UK) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Kentucky/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/77017,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,28,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00264-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900958831,900807083,HORIZONTAL,"{792235=I have a great abundance of academic rigor.

basketball is big here, and students take it seriously. :)"", ""during finals week, it is said that rubbing the foot of the patterson statue next to the patterson office tower will bring you luck. you can't graduate without trying a spicy beef wrap from ovids, and winter always means sledding down the bowl in front of the library."", ""tuition is a bit steep but it is a public university so not nearly as high as a private college. being in state helps. if you live in kentucky you can use your kees money too, which helps out tremendously! other ways to save money day to day: with your meal plan you get flex dollars. you can use these to buy cereal at the two corner stores on campus, but because those things are so overpriced, you are better off just buying those things at kroger if you can make a trip and using your flex dollars for other things. for example, starbucks takes flex dollars, so if you're an avid starbucks user, you are better off using your flex dollars for that because you can get other things cheaper elsewhere. always carry your student id with you, it will get you discounts at numerous places. fazoli's on north campus gives a discount to students. always always compare prices of textbooks from amazon.com to the bookstores - you really do not need a brand new textbook, so buy it used if you find one. and cheap seats through the student activities board shows movies for $1, so plan on catching ones you didn't see there on the big screen with free popcorn."", ""there is an almost infinite amount of things you can do for fun at uk. things that are high in tradition and also tons of fun include attending basketball games, going to keeneland meets, and participating in the little kentucky derby, the weekend before derby festival in which there is a hot air balloon race and balloon glow. if you volunteer you can even help blow up a hot air balloon. basketball games are beyond fun, especially if you get tickets in the erupption zone. uk also hosts the world's largest water balloon fight, so watch for flyers about that. the key to having fun at uk is getting involved. with your dorm, a sorority or fraternity, the student activities board, or a religious organization, any way you do it stay involved and meet people."", ""if you live in a dorm you will get a meal plan, which have changed a lot since i lived in the dorms, so i can't really comment on that; just use it wisely. there are four main places on campus that take meal plans: blazer, commons, ovids and k-lair. blazer is the buffet style all-you-can-eat place on north campus, and the food is usually decent here. commons is the equivalent on south campus, and depending on the day, the food is adequate but sometimes boring here. ovids is located on the side of the william t. young library, and the food is great here, but watch out for busy times because it gets extremely crowded. and lastly, k-lair is in central campus, and i think the food gets overlooked a lot here but is really good. it has a lot more space than ovids, and just as good of food but for some reason people tend to forget about it."", ""some of the dorms are outdated, but i would definitely recommend living in a dorm at least for one or two years. it's a unique experience and you meet so many people that way. north campus is not as crowded as south campus, so it is a lot more quiet, and it is very close to a lot of food places on south limestone. it is quite a hike to the library and to south campus, however, so if you have friends also attending, try to get on the same side of campus at least!"", 'i gave three stars for academic rigor - it really just depends on what major you choose. i was an accounting student at the gatton college of business and economics. i felt that some of the university studies courses were pretty easy but very interesting, but once you get into your upper division accounting classes, it can get extremely challenging. i have had several friends who were in the engineering department, and that is one of the most difficult majors out there. get ready to work your butt of there! same with nursing. but it will all be worth it if you find what you love.', ""apply for housing early; it fills up fast. meet with your advisor about classes; they know what prerequisites you need to be on track and can give you great advice. attend everything you can go to - basketball games, lectures, keeneland meets, student activity board events - don't miss out on a thing!

I lived in one of the dorms that are considered the worst and I still didn't mind living there. The Blanding-Kirwan Complex, where I lived, as well as Hagin, are considered some of the worst residence halls on campus, but its mostly due to age. The Complex was a great place to live just because there so many people at any given time of day, it was almost guaranteed to make a new buddy!

The towers aren't bad (2 person rooms) but they have communal bathrooms that are very old, and the elevators occasionally go out. Central Campus has guy-only dorms and a girl-only dorm. I have been told that Haggin for the guys is awful, but everyone survives. North Campus is where the newest dorms are for now, and those dorms are known for being more studious. Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people and make friends. When people on your floor go out, if you have made an effort to talk to them, they might ask you to go along too! Talking about dorm experiences is another way to connect with people, so no matter where you might end up in the dorms it is a good experience to have."", ""I am currently taking more difficult classes with professors who expect a lot from each student, regardless of background knowledge of the topic.

It is an old tradition to rub on the statue of the former University of Kentucky President James K. Patterson Statue for good luck before a final. Another finals week tradition, or rather supersition is that walking through the quad during finals week will not bode well for the person who does it. One unusual spot on campus is the President's house. It is tradition that the house grounds aroumnd the house would be open for student's use.

Free movies are also presented to in the Worsham Theatre on Campus. The Dining halls also offer special meals which are cooked outside in the open with a party-like atmosphere including lights and music.
