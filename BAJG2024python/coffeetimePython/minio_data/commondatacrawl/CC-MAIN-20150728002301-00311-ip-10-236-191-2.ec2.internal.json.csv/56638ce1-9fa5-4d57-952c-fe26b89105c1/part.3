€JÔ" at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time.

In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus.

So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August.

I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

It is true that you can just skate by at ASU but you can also get a great education. As a senior, I am just realizing how many resources are truly available to me on campus.

When I am now almost paying double of what I was paying when first admitted three years ago so keep that in mind when you are planning your college finances. Just because tuition and fees are one-price this year, don't simply multiply that number by 4 because those numbers are sure to change.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus.

Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can.

As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly.

If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities.

I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""Since ASU is such a large university, no one is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. You have to go out and find all of your own opportunities (i.e. scholarships, assistant positions, etc.). The opportunities are definitely there (trust me, there are plenty of them), it's just up to you to go after them. ASU is great for the types of students who are able and willing to seek out their own opportunities and endeavors. Even if you are not (I wasn't when I first started out), ASU is a great place for you to learn how to."", ""Get to know your professors! Building student-teacher relationships is really important for getting more opportunities (i.e. letters of recommendation, teaching assistant/research assistant positions). Plus, they can serve as your mentors and help you with just about anything. Don't overdo yourself. Some students get really excited at the thought of college and immediately sign themselves up for everything they can. As the semester goes on, they are worn down and exhausted. Find some things that you are interested in and get involved, just don't overdo it. ASU has a lot of opportunities, so finding stuff to get involved in is easy. Don't skip class! A lot of people enjoy the freedom of college where the professors don't take attendance. However, these students usually end of paying the price with a failing grade. Yes, you will find some really easy classes where a lot of students skip and end up doing okay. But, for the most part, skipping class is a bad idea. Most of my professors have designed their classes so that the exams are designed so the that the material comes from 50% lecture and 50% text book. Therefore, attending class (and taking notes) is crucial to your grade. I know a lot of people who skipped class and ended up failing and having to re-take it. If you have room in your schedule, take a class that interests you that is not related to your major. Sometimes, you may feel overwhelmed by all of your classes that have to do with engineering, business, psych, or whatever your major may be. Taking an unrelated class lets you take a break. I took a calligraphy class and it turned out to be really relaxing! Meet people! When you take your first classes in college, you are most likely going to be in huge lecture halls with 100 or 200 other students. Many of these kids with be with you until the end of your college years. Meet them! Then you can work together on homework, projects, etc. and help each other out. Having people to who are going through the same challenges as you is really nice to have. You can work through it and study together. Plus, you get to make a lot more new friends! Live in the dorm for at least your first year. Living in the dorm is how you meet most of your college friends because you are always on campus. I have friends that have never lived in a dorm and it was much harder for them to meet people and make new friends. I also have friends who moved off campus after freshman year and regretted it. They said they felt cut off from everyone else because they weren't on campus as much."", ""Because ASU is a public institution, the tuition is much cheaper than the private schools' tuition. Especially because I am in the honors college (which has it's own community), I get the feel of attending a small liberal arts college with the opportunities of a large university. So, I get the best of both worlds at the cost of $9,000 a year. It's awesome!"", ""There is so much to do here. Because ASU is such a large university, there are so many opportunities, both academically and socially. There are so many clubs! There is pretty much every kind of club you can imagine. If ASU doesn't have it, then you can start it (it's really easy). I am involved in a bunch of organizations and have leadership positions in a few of them. It has been so much fun! Since ASU is a large research institute, there are plenty of opportunities for research assistant positions and teaching assistant positions. Some incoming freshman may think that these positions sound boring, but they turned out to be a lot of fun and they also serve as great learning experiences. Not to mention, they look really good on the resume for grad school! I am in the honors college, so I got to live in the BRAND NEW dorms! They are really nice! I had an apartment style dorm, so I had my own room and three suitemates. My dorm also had two bathrooms (so I only had to share with one other person and I got my own sink!), a living room and kitchenette with a dining area. The dorm came with a fridge, kitchen sink, chairs, desks, tables, a couch and an entertainment stand. So, I didn't have to bring that much stuff."", ""Most people don't like taking the introductory classes (i.e. 101 classes) because they are so broad. Don't worry though! After freshman year, you can take the upper division classes, which are a lot more interesting. I have loved all of my classes so far and I have definitely learned a lot from them. The higher level the class, the smaller the class size is as well, which allows the professors to get to know you better. The higher level classes cover much more challenging and in depth information, so it helps to know your professor so he/she can help you with any material you may be struggling with.""]]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20188,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,137,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00311-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893447335,893248239,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college.

During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

I'm from the east coast and i went to ASU not knowing a single person. I ended up making tons of friends from all of the country including people that live in the same area as me. Also, i recommend the W.P. Carey school of business to any future business majors, the professors are great, and i have learned a lot so far.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

ASU not only had one of the lowest tuition rates (both in- and out-of-state) out of the entire United States, it also offered me the highest scholarship. That alone made Arizona State University, financially, the best university that I have found, but in addition to this, ASU was one of the best quality schools. First of all, ASU has one of the top Honors colleges in the nation, for good reason. This honors college at ASU has many dedicated staff members. These staff members get to personally know the students and go out of their way to hold workshops outside of class to help students write better papers, and even take the time to write helpful comments/criticisms on essay assignments. In addition to this, ASU has dining halls open for fourteen hours during week days and thirteen hours during weekends, as well as markets that offer food in exchange for meals from meal plans until 2 am during week days and midnight on weekends; the dining halls and markets also post nutrition facts about all of the food served for those wishing to eat healthier and those with allergies. In addition to this, the lounge facilities (ping pong tables, billiards, etc.) are free to use, and the recreation center has a low membership fee, as well as various free exercise classes. Furthermore, ASU has a free Flash bus system which travels around the Tempe campus, as well as buses/shuttles which travel between all of the ASU campuses; the metro bus/light rail system also offers great ticket deals for ASU students. Several businesses surrounding ASU also have many good deals for students, in addition to different temporary boutiques that businesses host on campus with inexpensive items such as jewelry and books.', 'Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢\x80\x94my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢\x80\x99ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends.', ""At ASU, I am currently taking an Ancient Greek Literature class, French, and Java Programming, among others. In just my Greek class, I have learned about not only ancient Greek texts, such as the Iliad by Homer, Apology of Socrates by Aristotle, and Life of Alexander [the Great] by Plutarch, but I have also learned how to closely analyze texts based on diction, figurative language, and allusions from Greek myths, as well as various other literary techniques. Because of this, I have been able to apply these techniques to my honors Human Event class, in which students are expected to be able to closely analyze philosophical texts such as Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes and The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. This will also help me in my English course next semester, and will continue to aid me as I seek a degree in English and a certificate in creative writing. In addition to my ancient Greek class, I am also in French. In my French class, we have learned more verb tenses, specifically past tenses, and more vocabulary. Because of this new knowledge of verb tenses, I am better able to tell stories of events that have occurred, as well as read and comprehend more French texts. In addition to this, my increasing knowledge of the French language and culture due to this class has allowed me to connect with other people, not only students, from around the world. In addition to this, I have also learned much in my Java programming class. In this class, I have learned how to write simple programs that display text on a monitor, Ã¢\x80\x9cmad libÃ¢\x80? programs, and even bank account programs that allow the user to create a bank account to deposit, withdraw, add interest, and display an account summary. I've also learned how to be more social, as I have spoken to teachers for help with assignments and have met more students from all of my different classes that have helped me with various homework assignments.""]]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20188,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,159,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00311-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893447335,893248239,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college.

My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

You will definitely learn something new everyday!']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20188,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,162,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00311-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893447335,893248239,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The best thing about ASU is the vast amount of backgrounds that its students come from because it allows for you to learn about other cultures while making friends. Furthermore, ASU is great for students who want to be involved and have a complete college experience.', 'When joining ASU, think of it as a large family. Do not be afraid to introduce yourself to people around you in your classes. Get out there and make friends as well as attend events and your college experience will instantly be better. Also, keep in contact with your professors. It is extremely helpful when your professors know who you are because it allows you to ask them questions and get a response back promptly.', 'Though I believe college is expensive, ASU makes up for this with plenty of exciting events for students to attend with free food (though we technically paid for this), movie nights, bounce houses, and many other awesome events such as the carnival and haunted house at West for Homecoming. It is all up to the students to be involved and attend these events in order to get bang for the buck.', 'At ASU West, I enjoy that there are no distractions since the campus is so calm, yet I can leave the dorm, catch a shuttle, and arrive in Tempe when need be. I find the students here easy to befriend and all the professors that I have had have great attitudes and enthusiasm about their subject area. It is also nice to have a short ten to fifteen minute walk to classes and the food here is pretty great.', 'Every single teacher that I have had at ASU West has been dedicated to my learning and my success. Each one makes sure to respond quickly to any questions I have sent regarding homework or large assignments and each has helped me to understand various complicated such as how to teach to a student who has a learning disability versus a student who has autism. Moreover, the classes are challenging for students, which provides a great opportunity to grow.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20188,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,163,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00311-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893447335,893248239,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

I was recently extremely impressed by Barrett because they paid for my and several other students tickets to the TEDxPhoenix conference, which I wouldn't have been able to attend otherwise due to the steep cost of the tickets. Thanks to the administration I was able to listen to some of the most incredible talks I have ever heard, and have since become involved in TED events on campus.

I have never been as consistently fascinated by anything as I am by this class! I have only just finished my first semester as a French major (and am changing it to Art History), so as for classes in the rest of the university, my opinions are based only on the introductory courses that ASU students must take to advance within their major.

If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680Wå(„é‹†Kÿ*-›æ}€­6¦°Zh¦}>Ój$» =ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

It is also good for those who are looking for a college where things happen. There are tons of clubs with sororities and fraternities everywhere. Being in the Tempe there is never a dull moment! With mill avenue, Tempe market place, and various other venues there is plenty of things to do. ASU isn't a hard school and the classes are mostly relaxed. Don't go in nervous because everything is a lot less nerve racking then you think."", ""Always go to class! This is a saying that adults tell kids all the time. I found out the hard way that this is a very true statement. Though missing a few classes won't hurt it is important to go most of the time so you learn the information that will be on exams. In many classes professors take attendance randomly to see who actually attends class. Also, try to find the cheapest books you can! They are very expensive and are used most of the time. I would recommend either getting your books a week or so before classes start(if a class has reading due on the first day) or waiting till after classes start to see if you really need all the books the professors assign. With these books do the reading! If you fall behind catch up. Don't let yourself get far behind because it will be impossible to catch up. Near exam times at the end of the semester professors like to have exams on the same day. If this happens and you haven't read the material, studying becomes extremely hard. Near finals if your grades don't seem where you want them to be, don't fret because most of the time your final grade will be higher then you think. Just study for the exams and everything should go good! My last tip would be to go out, explore, and make friends. College is a time to learn Anout yourself and grow as a person. College won't be very fun without friends to share the time with!"", ""To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks."", ""I do enjoy going to ASU for the most part. Because it is such a large campus with tons of Students making lots of friends because challenging sometimes. Though it is quite easy to meet people in classes around campus you don't really talk to many people. I didn't live on campus so meeting people was restricted to classes and by friends of friends. Classes vary in size and I found larger classes to be easier. Though you don't get much face time with the professor I had an easier time focusing on lectures. Most of my teachers were fun and interesting and with the campus being in the heart of Tempe there is plenty to do during free time."", 'For most of your first semester in college it is about learning how things work. It is a time when people are trying out their chosen majors to see if they will work out. For me my major classes were interesting and I learned tones! For certain Classes labs help you to get a better understanding on the subject for which it pertains. One thing I learned was that the saying of go to class is very true! Though it is very easy and more fun not to attend classes it is crucial if you want a good grade or just want to learn things.']]",Arizona State University-Tempe (ASU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Arizona-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20188,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,166,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00311-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893447335,893248239,HORIZONTAL,"{630140=Before coming to ASU, I absolutely hated the schoolÃ¢Â€Â”my sister went here, it was known as a party school, it was hot, it was too close to my home, I could list several reasons why I would do my best to avoid enrolling at this college. However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend.

I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA.

In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time.

I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost.

All the class buildings are close to the dorm building so getting to class is relatively easy.', 'An unusual location on campus is the civic space park across from the downtown campus and the place in between the dorm building and the school buildings called taylor mall.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus.

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on.

Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can.

All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best.

Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means.

ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus).

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means.

For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over.

Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities.

I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated.

ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party.

This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it.

Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in Ÿ_Li’

Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class.

"[['Categories', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', 'Arizona State University is overall a fun school. You have all the different kind of clubs. Name a random type of club and I will guarantee that it is available here on campus. There are also the sports. Students will go all out to support all of our teams from the football games to basketball games; you will see them there cheering our team on. Greek life is also entertaining to students here at Arizona State University. I am currently not in Greek life, but I do plan on joining a sorority next semester. Greek life does so much volunteering and community service such as raising money for charities or other organizations. I think it would be so much fun to be a part of a sorority and to get to know the people that will be a part of my life forever. There is also the annual Undie Run which is an event in which students undress to dress people who do not have money for clothes. It is a fun day but at the same time it helps people with needs. There is no way that Arizona State University does not have anything to do for fun. The list that I named above is only little things that this University has to offer its students. Arizona State University is nothing but fun.', 'The food and dining at Arizona State University is absolutely incredible. There are so many different varieties of foods that students can get. There is Mexican food, Chinese food, Italian food, etc. There is also a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice for students who like to drink coffee or smoothies. ASU amazes me with all the food and dining that they have available for us students. There is also Maroon and Gold, also known as M&G, which is another way of paying for food for ASU students and it is much cheaper. Meal plans are also great for food and dining and are a great convenience if they want more of a home cooked meal. In the end, the food and dining on campus has satisfied my hunger every single time.', 'My freshmen year I decided to live at home because it was the cheaper way out. I would have loved to live on campus to experience campus life and to just experience being on my own. Unfortunately, I was not able to do either of those, but I was able to visit my friends that did live on campus. One of my very good friends would always have positive feedback from living on campus. She would say that it is hard at first transitioning from living with your parents to living on your own, but it is a great experience in the end. My friend would note that living on campus, it makes everything much closer. For example, if one would want some peace and quiet while studying, they could just simply walk over to the library instead of driving to campus to get to the library if one lived at home. Also, you can get to classes and extracurricular activities quickly without having to worry about transportation since you can walk to most places. Plus, there are a lot more opportunities to meet new people. You also get your first real sense of being independent and on your own without being completely thrown into the real world by yourself. Overall, living on campus is a great convenience for incoming students.', 'Last semester was tougher that this semester because of the fact that my major was Biology Human Genetics. I only had a hard time with my Biology class. I realized then that Biology was not the right major for me which is why I changed it to Accounting. My second semester was much more easier because the classes that I took were ones that I enjoyed. The classes were tough in my opinion were rigorous but are able to be overcome with studying. So, that is what I and any other college student would do. I studied to maintain good grades in each one of my classes. Overall, Arizona State University does have hard courses, but nothing is too hard unless students study.', 'My number one tip for future incoming students is to always go to class. For one, students pay thousands to be enrolled at Arizona State University, so why not take advantage of it?

The professors that I have had for the past years have proved to me that they are there for every one of their students 100%.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather.

Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party.

So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class.

But with the help of professors, study groups, teacher's assistants, tutoring centers, actually studying, and doing your work, you can succeed.

The more you know, the better you can further your education and make your stay at ASU easier. Ration your time well. Make sure you have plenty of time to study and do your homework and school projects. The better you do in classes, especially in your first few semesters, the more you will be able to do later. Such things include: studying abroad, applying for scholarships, getting into grad school, and hopefully even getting a job. Joining clubs and/or student organizations is a great way to make new friends, get to know the campus, network, learn, explore, and have fun.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

During normal games, everyone wears gold, but in the black out games, everyone is dressed from head to toe in black.

ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university.

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ...

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Fraternity and Sorority Life is constantly finding ways to help and support Greek Life members and make it a better community on all four campuses. I definitely recommend Greek Life to all students.', 'Arizona State University has over 300 student organizations on all four campuses and it highly encourages university involvement. Due to its size and diversity, all students have the opportunity to join the organizations that they feel comfortable with and will possibly help them in their career path. It is crucial that students become involved with academic, service, athletic, political, etc. organizations; it will help their growth and networking.', ""ASU's four campuses are located in different areas around the valley, but I am currently at the Tempe campus.

The academic programs all have major maps that serve as guides for students to follow their courses and your junior and senior years become more rigorous because you become more involved with your major's courses. All course homework is dependent on the readings assigned; dedicate around 20 to 30 hours of studying a week."", 'As a current student at Arizona State University, one of my main tips for perspective students is to become involved in organizations in the university and meet new people; the campuses are large and it can be easy to feel lonely. Also, to help learning purposes, I suggest that incoming students sit in the front rows of classes because many classes are large and some of the students sitting in the back are on their computers and it can be distracting if you are sitting behind them. Some minor tips are to purchase a planner and input deadlines for courses, study for exams weeks in advance and develop a professional relationship with your professors.', 'Arizona State University is a pan-campus university and one of the most diverse universities in the country.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more.

With so many people you will be able to find a community by getting involved and many other students will be in the same college as you. ASU is especially known for their Business College, while their Education and Engineering College are among the top in the Nation. Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation.

It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates.

If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer.

Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus!

In the first couple of weeks, there are tons of welcome and back to school events that happen.

The residence hall association also puts on many other events throughout the school year, and these are just the things that happen on campus.

There are hard and easy classes, balance them so you don't go insane."", ""For your first year, have fun. The previous tip is important, but the next one is more so; it id going to be hard, but you must find a balance between classes and having a social life.

Don't worry, you can still enjoy a social life, especially if you are a sun devil."", 'ASU is described as a party school, but it also has many nationalized recognized degree programs.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona. However, due to the recent increase in tuition it would make sense to me that out of state students look hard into options of schools they are able to attend, especially if money is",True,0,0,

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona!

My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is.

( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Arizona State is not located in an outdoorsy environment, but students are able to hike ASU Mountain at any time! People who enjoy the city life will do great here. The desert is beautiful. Tips for prospective students Prospective Students take the following advice; do well on your SATS and ACTS for scholarships are not very hard to get at ASU, visit the campus, look into your majors program ( if no major has been decided pick a few you may enjoy and look into those), and live on campus! Bang for the buck For instate students I believe that Arizona State is the finest education that you will be able to receive while in the region of Arizona.

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible!

However, now that IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been here, I must say that I am really glad that I came here. I really enjoy being at ASU for many reasons; one reason is that, although ASU is known as a party school, I have yet to see any disruptive parties on campus, even though ASU and its various clubs host several social events, such as the Tiki Luau and the 11-11-11 Make a Wish party, in order to bring the entire ASU community closer together. In addition to this, for all of the dorms on campus, there are various lounges and recreation centers provided, which include ping pong tables, volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, televisions, kitchens, and even a swimming pool. In addition to this, the staff members at ASU are very pleasant and helpful. In fact, at the beginning of the year, I was searching for a specific building and went to a random writing center, since it was the closest place where I knew to find some university staff members. The three staff members immediately did all they could in order to help me find that building, from searching the computers and even helping me find the building on the map. In addition to this, many members of staff even get to know students personally, especially the dining hall staff. ASU has been very welcoming, helpful, and understanding in order to make college a much more enjoyable experience for me and many other students. ASU Counselors and teachers have also been very pleasant. In addition to this, Mill Avenue (a strip mall) is right next to ASU with several shops and restaurants and ASU often hosts small boutiques on campus that sell unique odds and ends., 50824=Being an out of state students has its advantages and disadvantages. My first time ever being in the state of Arizona let alone Arizona State University was during the second week of August 2008. It was my first time being away from family that I knew my whole life. When I arrived in Arizona, I stayed with distant family in the town of Gilbert. This was a strange feeling to be in a new state with family I had not known very well. Many out of state freshman come to this school without ever visiting before and when they come it is a new and awkward place. Many people want to be there to show them around and get them involved in campus so they can start making friends and learning what this campus has to offer. Resident Assistants can help assist them in choosing clubs to join, finding a success coach to help them with college, show them around campus so they won't be lost. There are a lot of things to find about this campus. Many resources like the tutoring center, technology center, and student service are places that help students out for free and should be used frequently by freshman's., 492838=I can honestly say I learned a lot at ASU-- I majored in Justice Studies and Global Human Rights and I am heading to law school in August. I learned a ton about succeeding academically, professionally, and socially. But I must say that with my majors I don't feel ready to tackle the work force. I feel like most Liberal Arts majors at ASU (like most universities) require further schooling to obtain professional work., 4749=-join as many extra curricular activities as possible! You won't always get along with your room mates so it's important to join clubs, greek life, ect. -drink lots of water, it is HOT in arizona! ( i learned that the hard way.. almost passing out while walking across campus -- but don't worry you'll get used to it) -live in Hassayampa - the newest and nicest dorm there is -take advantage of all the tree tutoring on campus, it helps alot -choose early morning classes - i know it sounds rough but when it gets past noon in August in AZ it tends to get up to 110 degrees.. and it's also good to get them out of the way -and of course have fun :-) there is a big pool on campus for when your stressed from exams and just want to take a break, 662922=To go to a state university it is pretty much required that you will be spending a lot of money to attend. My first semester tuition was around $5,200 not including my books which were another 3 or $400. I would recommend new colleg students to always look for the cheapest books you can get! I chose to live off campus at my parents house because the living costs for living on campus were rediculous. with this there is also food plans and much more. Even though it is expensive to go to a university I find it to be worth it. Though classes are much larger then at community colleges there is a sense of community with declared majors. For the first semester you are given a cluster of classes which most people in the major are also in. This gives students the chance to meet and make friends with the people they will have classes with during their college time. The only I don't like is that you are forced to pay $1000 for one class while some classes are completely online. I don't those classes are really worth the big bucks., 54441=Moving into the dorms is the best experience ever! Getting your 'own' place away from the parents. I would defintely recommend living in dorms that are on the south side of campus such as Hassayampa just because they are a little less party orientated. You have more peace and quite than those who live on north side of campus. I had the experience of living in Palo Verde Main dorms for my first semester and though it was really fun in those dorms it was still very distracting. The buildings are older on north campus so you are more likely to hear neighbors or people in the hallway more than if you lived on south campus. During the month of August when students start arriving there are so many free events going on. I recommend going to everything you can so you can have fun before the classes get into session; this week is known as welcome back week!, 364041=College is an entirely new experience, you have classes when you choose and a lot more free time. Also there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that you are interested in with more than 1000 club and activities to choose from., 134161=I would recommend waiting until the first day of class to find out if the textbook listed will actually be used in class. Often times the textbook listed will not be used at all. Also I would highly recommend using the www.ratemyprofessor.com website when picking classes. Sign up for orientation early in order to register for your classes early while there are still open seats. To get a good dorm, put in your application as early as you can. Go for the 1000 Maroon and Gold Dollars meal plan, as the cafeteria food gets old very fast, and the 14 Meals a Week plan is very expensive., 12135=First off, rate your professor website is very helpful in finding good professors and its true good professors can make a big difference on your efforts in class as well as saving your GPA. All you need is note books and if you can print of lecture notes before your classes start......and yes lecture note are online under blackboard you will hear about it during orientation. As far as making friends at the university there are so many people so just be your self. If you are really pulling for that high GPA in college then try to make friends with some smart people in classes and exchange numbers but do not rely on them all the times if anything just be prepared before asking another student questions because he or she may not know the answer. Keep in mind when your signing up for classes imagine that the class will start 1 hour earlier. example there is a class that starts at 7:30 am so imagine it will start at 6:30 am now ask your self...could you make it to class if it did start at 6:30? that hour is the time it will take you to get ready if your a morning person than your good if not then reconsider., 41296=Arizona State University Ã¢Â€Â“ as a 2nd year student this Fall 2009, I have enjoyed attending this university. I especially enjoy the variety of students from, literally, all around the world. ASU has four campuses and I attend the Main campus (also known as Tempe campus). On this campus, you can find buildings that are old, but some are fairly new. The school environment, especially the school I'm in W.P. Carey, makes it conducive for studying. The weather, especially in the fall, winter, and part of Spring, is great., 26680=ASU offers plenty of things to do. Take it from me, a student that has to say on campus from 9:40 a.m till 7:30 p.m. There is always something to do such as joining a club, going to the recreation complex, meeting new people at the Memorial Union, and for those students that love to have a good time the occasional party. Every once in a while there will be people giving out free drinks., 475207=Check out your professors. Ask around for input. Also, their credentials. Check the campus, location of and the times of your classes when you register (with an advisors guidance) and again a week before the semester starts. If you live on campus, time and walk to each of your classrooms, giving yourself at least 10 minutes leeway to get to class a little early, making sure you have time and KNOW where your class is. Also, it doesn't hurt to find the closest bathrooms and vending machines to your classrooms. Also, unless they are literally in the same building or next door, don't have two classes that end and start 15 minutes between each other. It just doesn't work. The same for living off campus. Depending if you're down the street a mile or in the next city, you will want to leave your living conditions at least a half an hour before your class. Traffic, construction, closed sidewalks, and whether you are walking, biking, skateboarding etc, across campus and if your classroom is on the 6th floor, or that odd corner of the basement of that one building that only has an entrance on the other side- will determine whether you get to class on time. So, give yourself extra time. Another tip, if you're not a morning person, then DON'T take classes before 10am. You'll undoubtedly be late or miss class on a normal basis leaving you with a Withdrawn or a failing grade. Unless it's ASU 101, then it won't matter :P JK. ... Start with a load you know you can handle (12 credits/hours or less). If you're computer/internet savvy, plus have convenient access to a 2009 yr or newer computer with all basic software, with solid internet access, updated sound and graphics accessories, a printer, and availability to use at least 5 hours a day, try an online class. Taking exams in your PJs is a life saver and far far less stressful. One more. If you live on campus, and all your classes are on thus said campus, this won't matter really. But if you're transporting to campus, don't pay for a parking permit. They are awfully expensive. There are many options for free campus and public transportation. Check out the options best for you., 896181=Greek life is huge on the Tempe campus, but as of Fall 2012, Greek life is going to be big at the downtown campus, Taylor Place will be having a Greek life floor and it will be the first year to experiment with this., 573155=ASU is great for students who want to escape the cold weather. It's bathing suit season in Arizona from about March to October. The pools on campus are always full, and students are always out and about., 178154=Arizona State University is one of the largest Universities in the nation, it offers a varieties of degree programs at several different levels to include bachelors' degrees, masters, doctoral and certificates. Numbering over 2000, the veterans community is quite large and simultaneously there are ROTC opportunities. Finally, ASU is very much in tune with the needs of the workforce and therefore includes such out-of-the-box type majors as Sustainability and various Engineering and science technology degrees spread out over four physical campuses and an online campus., 975548=Everywhere has its bad areas, but there is a lot of ASU police patrolling the area constantly. I had my 1300 dollar road bike stolen from the dorms, so anything can happen, just be careful!, 186252=Try to get all physical paperwork in as early as possible to avoid horribly long lines, beware of skateboarders and don't sign up for 7:40 am classes unless you know you are a morning person., 95744=It is my first experience living in a dorm and I love it. Although ASU is big you will like it because you will get to know what independence means. You can do anything that you want as long as it is not a bad thing. you have your own space to do your work, and have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Clubs at ASU are amazing. ASU has over 500 clubs that you can choose from. There is leadership clubs, dance clubs, religious clubs, you can find anything that you wish or I believe you can organize your own club if you desire. Vacations are the best. We get a month vacation for December which is awesome and we spend a lot of time just working on extra things that we want to achieve. For instance, I went to Mexico and just had fun with my family until break was over. It was awesome!, 291923=With the economy, ASU has risen its instate tuition by $136 for those who enrolled in 2008. I can not speak for the tuition raise for incoming freshman - it may be more. Also certain schools, for example the WP Carey school of Business and Honors College have steep tuition. The quality is exceptional. The tuition increases and fees are, perhaps, a necessary evil., 800285=tuition is on the low end if you look at other school's prices nationally. college is expensive. arizona legislature is trying to pass a bill that mandates that every student pay $2000 out of pocket with no chance of using scholarship money awarded by asu or its affilates, so be very aware of this if you need financial assistance. it hasn't passed yet, but when you read this, go to google and see if it passed or not, and proceed from there., 351722=Be prepared for a lot of sun and random rain storms during August and September. Nice weather, and there is always help the first couple weeks of school.}",,"07/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 79 out of 82 people found this review useful. 1 of 694 Stephanie from Tempe, AZ Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Admittedly, College of the Atlantic isn't cheap. It is a private institution and is priced as such. However, students at College of the Atlantic come from all walks of life, all income levels, etc. An impressive number of international students flock here each year. COA is extremely generous with scholarship money, grants, etc. A very committed staff will personally take the time to make sure you can afford your tuition. You can also choose to be involved in work-study, which is an enriching part of the COA experience. One of the positions is well sought after - kitchen duty, where students learn to prepare organic and local foods with care. Whatever the price tag, COA is invaluable. It will diversify you, allow you to travel (money is set aside for this), change your perspective on the world, and introduce you to people that can and will help you grow as a person."", ""Most people will tell you that as soon as they stepped on campus, they knew it was home. It could have been the view from the cozy, woodsy campus - from the patio of Kaelber hall, you can look out onto the breathtakingly beautiful Frenchman bay. Perhaps it was the people that felt like home. Friendly, energetic intellectuals who welcome just about anyone they see around campus. Maybe it took the classroom experience to pull them in. Sitting in on your first COA class is like being introduced to an entirely new world of possibilities. Challenging, fun, often mind-blowing. So what do we do for fun on a tiny island off the coast of Maine? Acadia National Park is more or less the back yard of College of the Atlantic. It is an amazing opportunity for recreation and education, beautiful year-round. At the college, students are rarely bored. From All College Meetings (or ACM), where students have a powerful voice in the college's decisions, to open mics, theater presentations, dances, and field trips."", ""The positive energy at COA is infectious. When everyone around you is incredibly passionate about what they're studying, it's hard to resist your own curiosity. The concept of going to class is completely redefined at the college by spirited professors, field work, independent studies, and hands-on applications. COA believes that college should not be a time out of life, but should be a time of learning that inspires your future. Professors become good friends. Your education is virtually completely up to you - if you have an idea, people at the college will be enthusiastic to help make it happen. An internship and senior project are required, and the products and experiences of each student are drastically individual and unique. At around 300 students, classes of about 8 people or so engage in in-depth conversations.

COA believes that college should not be a time out of life, but should be a time of learning that inspires your future. Professors become good friends. Your education is virtually completely up to you - if you have an idea, people at the college will be enthusiastic to help make it happen. An internship and senior project are required, and the products and experiences of each student are drastically individual and unique.

Admittedly, College of the Atlantic isn't cheap. It is a private institution and is priced as such. However, students at College of the Atlantic come from all walks of life, all income levels, etc. An impressive number of international students flock here each year. COA is extremely generous with scholarship money, grants, etc. A very committed staff will personally take the time to make sure you can afford your tuition. You can also choose to be involved in work-study, which is an enriching part of the COA experience. One of the positions is well sought after - kitchen duty, where students learn to prepare organic and local foods with care. Whatever the price tag, COA is invaluable. It will diversify you, allow you to travel (money is set aside for this), change your perspective on the world, and introduce you to people that can and will help you grow as a person. Am enjoying being here Most people will tell you that as soon as they stepped on campus, they knew it was home. It could have been the view from the cozy, woodsy campus - from the patio of Kaelber hall, you can look out onto the breathtakingly beautiful Frenchman bay. Perhaps it was the people that felt like home. Friendly,",True,0,0,

If you think that a bachelor of arts will be your last degree, then COA's excellent financial aid program can make this school a great deal. If you know that you're going to go further, then the added cost of everything you will have to take that COA doesn't offer makes this a terrible deal."", ""TAB has inexpensive options most of the time, and vegan and vegetarian options all of the time. The food is healthy (usually) and relative to the food available at larger universities, sustainably sourced. It tastes alright... most of the time 'veggies' means bell peppers and onions though."", ""Dorm life can be great in the Village where composting toilets and functioning dishwashers make for happier residents. The unlucky students who are housed in Cottage or Carriage house however contend with insect infestations, flooding, and poor heat. It's a toss-up. The on-campus community is a tight little knot in the knitted fabric of greater COA."", ""Academic rigor is great for the first year and a half, but after you've exhausted the intro level classes, material becomes repetitive. Classes are only 10 weeks long, which often forces faculty to truncate material. Some professors instead ask students to work more intensely during the shorter term, but those classes are usually unpopular and don't recur. The short term length in combination with outdated, underfunded, and in some cases non-existent lab facilities make for physical science classes that are academically weak. On paper, the college offers equivalent courses to science courses available at a university, but in practice, the course objectives amount to about half of what's covered in traditional courses."", ""Make sure to check out the projected course schedule on the registrar's page before committing to attend. Basic courses like physics, chemistry, calculus, and biology are offered on a rotational schedule, sometimes of four years. Coordinating important classes with required internships, senior projects, and optional study abroad/monster class opportunities can be difficult. COA may have something for everyone, but it doesn't guarantee availability of all course areas all the time. Oftentimes broad subject areas are represented by only 1-2 faculty members, who do not always co-ordinate their sabbaticals and vacations."", ""College of the Atlantic has a great program for freshmen but the rest of its program fails to live up to the admissions office's advertisements.

They have an emergency call button that automatically connects you to our campus police department. All of the walkways and paths on the campus are very well lit and the campus police do constant patrols throughout the night to ensure campus safety. The safety ratings on Southeastern's campus are impeccable."", 'Here at Southeastern, we have over fifteen different Greek Fraternaties and Sororities giving each and every person a chance to meet new people and become a part of the Greek life. Our Fraternaties and Sororoties and very diverse and completely accepting.', ""We have a wide variety of Clubs and activities here on campus. If you can think of something, there is, more than likely, a club for that. We have the Student Counsil to help eliminate communication barriers between the staff and the students, we have the Circle K club, which is the higher level Key Club and they are both founded by the Rotary Club. There are intramural sports that you can join, and if it isn't being played already, you can start your own team with only ten signatures. There are a limitless number of things on campus to keep college students busy and active."", 'Southeastern is an ammazing University and is great for any and all types of students.', 'We have some of the best campus traditions there are. Every year, we put on the Gumbo YaYa, Strawberry Jubilee, Move In Mania, and so much more. Our mascot, Roomie the Lion, is another sacred tradition and we have an actual Lion that was stuffed sitting in our game room. It is said that if you rub his right paw, you will have good luck. One of the oldest traditions on campus would be Friendship Oak. Located in the center of our campus, we have one of the largest, oldest oak trees in Louisiana. It is said that if you kiss you significant other beneath the tree, you will eventually get married to that person.', 'Southeastern is the only University in Louisiana to participate in the Rental Textbook program. It allows you to rent out as many books as you need for each class for one flat rate of 45 dollars a class. Whether you need 12 books for one class, of just two books, the rental program allows you to save thousands of dollars in not having to purchase the books yourself. At the end of the semester, you simply return the books you have and check out the books you will need for your future classes. We also have the Pennington Student Activity Center which is a two story, state of the art, gym. Complete with an indoor track and basketball court, the activity center is completely paid for by your tuition so you have full access to it. It is a great way to help students stay in shape.', 'With the amount of entertainment options on campus, you can ensure that you will never be left looking for something to do. We have a campus game room, located above the book store, there are DVD rental machines housed in the Student Union, we have our own post office so that you can keep in touch with your family and friends, and the campus is conveniently located in Downtown Hammond, one of the busiest cities in Louisiana. There are also campus activities going on at all times throught the year. From our famous Gumbo YaYa, to the Strawberry Jubilee, you will always be able to keep busy and stay occupied.', ""Campus dining at Southeastern is remarkable. There is a huge variety of options when it comes to eating on campus. For example, we have the Cayman Cafe', serving a variety of home cooked meals from spaghetti, to tacos, the cafe has it all. It also includes a salad bar, multiple drink stations, a dessert bar, and a stir-fry grill. Also on campus we have Chick Fil A, Taco Bell, Popeye's, Burger King, Subway, and many more options. For all of the late night study sessions and early morning classes, we have two different Starbuck's locations and the campus coffe shop located in the library, Java City."", 'The dorms at Southeastern are impeccable. You have a choice of having either a shared room or your own private dorm. Either choice would be beyond exceptional. You have one shared, full, bathroom and a shared kitchenette area. The rooms are equipped with your own bed, a personal air conditioner, a study desk and chair, a dresser, and a closet with a floor length mirror. The dorm rooms are completely renovated and up to date and, conveniently, are only a 5 minute walk from the library.', 'Southeastern has one of the best student-to-teacher ratios of any University and that really gives you a sense of academic security and makes you strive to do the best you can. The classes are designed to help each and every student live up to their full academic potential and set you up for success.', ""When attending Southeastern, take advantage of the many clubs and organizations the school has to offer. Join a club and become a part of something great. Also utilize the Center for Student Excellence Center(CSE)'s free tutoring program to achieve your academic goals."", 'Southeastern Louisiana University is an amazing college.

The traditional option for a pilot to test their aircraft solo during Phase I is not covered or affected by this AC, and remains an option for those who choose to do so in accordance with their aircraftÃ¢\x80\x99s operating limitations.', 'Additional Weather Information: Domestic and Flag Air Carriers Provides guidance and standards to domestic and flag air carriers for approval of a system for obtaining forecasts and reports of adverse weather phenomena', 'Advanced Qualification Program Provides FAA guidance for approval of an Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) under SFAR 58.', 'Aeroelastic Stability Substantiation of Transport Category Airplanes This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance material for acceptable means, but not the only means, of demonstrating compliance with the provisions of Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations part 25 associated with the design requirements for transport category airplanes to preclude the aeroelastic instabilities offlutter, divergence, and control reversal.

This is important as there is a significant difference between an air carrier maintenance program and an inspection program used in non-air carrier maintenance operations. We explain the background of these programs as well as the Federal Aviation AdministrationÃ¢\x80\x99s (FAA) regulatory requirements. We also describe and explain each of the 10 elements of air carrier maintenance programs. When we use ""must"" or ""will"" in this AC, we are referencing actual regulatory requirements. When we use ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"" in this AC, we mean the FAA. When we use ""you,"" ""your,"" or ""yours,"" we mean you, the air carrier.

These changes include, among other things, exempting credit unions with up to $100 million in total assets from the new rule, lowering the risk-based capital ratio level required for an affected credit union to be classified as well capitalized from 10.5 percent to 10 percent, lowering the risk weights for various classes of assets, removing interest rate risk components from the risk weights, and extending the implementation timeframe to January 1, 2019. These changes would substantially reduce the number of credit unions subject to the rule, reduce the impact on affected credit unions, and afford affected credit unions sufficient time to prepare for the rule's implementation. The proposed risk-based capital requirement set forth in this proposal would be more consistent with NCUA's risk-based capital measure for corporate credit unions and more comparable to the regulatory risk-based capital measures used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and Office of the Comptroller of Currency (Other Banking Agencies). In addition, the proposed revisions would amend the risk weights for many of NCUA's current asset classifications; require higher minimum levels of capital for credit unions with concentrations of assets in real estate loans or commercial loans or higher levels of non-current loans; and set forth how NCUA can address a credit union that does not hold capital that is commensurate with its risk. The proposed revisions would also eliminate several provisions in NCUA's current PCA regulations, including provisions relating to the regular reserve account, risk-mitigation credits, and alternative risk weights.

It also eliminates the provisions in the current fixed assets rule relating to waivers from the aggregate limit. Further, instead of applying the prescriptive aggregate limit provided by regulation in the current fixed assets rule, the Board proposes to oversee FCU ownership of fixed assets through the supervisory process and guidance. The 2015 proposal also makes conforming amendments to the scope and definitions sections of the current fixed assets rule to reflect this proposed approach, and it amends the title of Ã‚Â§ 701.36 to more accurately reflect this amended scope and applicability. In addition, the 2015 proposal simplifies the fixed assets rule's partial occupancy requirements for FCU premises acquired for future expansion by establishing a single six-year time period for partial occupancy of such premises and by removing the 30-month requirement for partial occupancy waiver requests. The Board notes that, in July 2014, it issued a proposal regarding the fixed assets rule that addressed, among other things, the partial occupancy provisions of the fixed assets rule (July 2014 proposal), but NCUA did not finalize that proposal.

The amendments also expand the criteria in NCUA's current totality of the circumstances test, which is a regulatory tool used to determine if an association, after satisfying the above-referenced threshold requirement, also satisfies the associational common bond requirements necessary to qualify for inclusion in an FCU's FOM. The amendments will better ensure that FCUs comply with established membership requirements. Additionally, NCUA is granting automatic membership qualification under the associational common bond requirements to certain categories of associations that NCUA has routinely approved for FCU membership in the past.

To provide regulatory relief to FCUs, the 2015 proposal eliminates a provision in the current fixed assets rule that established a five percent aggregate limit on investments in fixed assets for FCUs with $1,000,000 or more in assets. It also eliminates the provisions in the current fixed assets rule relating to waivers from the aggregate limit. Further, instead of applying the prescriptive aggregate limit provided by regulation in the current fixed assets rule, the Board proposes to oversee FCU ownership of fixed assets through the supervisory process and guidance. The 2015 proposal also makes conforming amendments to the scope and definitions sections of the current fixed assets rule to reflect this proposed approach, and it amends the title of Ã‚Â§ 701.36 to more accurately reflect this amended scope and applicability. In addition, the 2015 proposal simplifies the fixed assets rule's partial occupancy requirements for FCU premises acquired for future expansion by establishing a single six-year time period for partial occupancy of such premises and by removing the 30-month requirement for partial occupancy waiver requests. The Board notes that, in July 2014, it issued a proposal regarding the fixed assets rule that addressed, among other things, the partial occupancy provisions of the fixed assets rule (July 2014 proposal), but NCUA did not finalize that proposal. For reasons discussed below, the 2015 proposal incorporates similar partial occupancy proposed amendments from the July 2014 proposal, with one modification to the time period for partial occupancy., 7367=Ã‚Â§ 1601 - Congressional findings and declaration of purpose, 8683=Ã‚Â§ 1614 - Repealed., 5928=Ã‚Â§ 1759 - Membership, 8182=Ã‚Â§ 1609 - Repealed., 7779=Ã‚Â§ 1605 - Determination of finance charge, 7991=Ã‚Â§ 1607 - Administrative enforcement}","Wed, 03 Jun 2015 14:27:04 GMT","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 25924 - Chartering and Field of Membership Manual 2015-05-06; vol. 80 # 87 - Wednesday, May 6, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

This rule is effective July 6, 2015. 12 CFR Part 701 Summary The NCUA Board (Board) is issuing a final regulation to amend the associational common bond provisions of NCUA's chartering and field of membership requirements. Specifically, the amendments establish a threshold requirement which provides that, in order for an association to qualify to be part of a federal credit union's (FCU) field of membership (FOM), the association must not have been formed primarily for the purpose of expanding credit union membership. The amendments also expand the criteria in NCUA's current totality of the circumstances test, which is a regulatory tool used to determine if an association, after satisfying the above-referenced threshold requirement, also satisfies the associational common bond requirements necessary to qualify for inclusion in an FCU's FOM. The amendments will better ensure that FCUs comply with established membership requirements. Additionally, NCUA is granting automatic membership qualification under the associational common bond requirements to certain categories of associations that NCUA has routinely approved for FCU membership in the past. For ease of reading, NCUA uses the terms Ã¢Â€ÂœassociationÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœgroupÃ¢Â€? interchangeably in this rulemaking. This is a list of",False,-1,0,{992=Title 12 published on 2015-01-01.}
