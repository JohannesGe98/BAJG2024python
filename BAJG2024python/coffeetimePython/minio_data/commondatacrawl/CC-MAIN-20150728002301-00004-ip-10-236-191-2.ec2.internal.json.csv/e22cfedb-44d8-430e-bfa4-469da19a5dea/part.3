Each semester there are hundreds of classes that are offered in pretty much every subject matter imaginable. The fact that Pomona is part of the five college Claremont Consortium only means that there are hundreds of more options available. You can take classes at any of the other colleges! The professors at Pomona are another huge reason why the education at Pomona is superb. All of the professors I have had have been eager to help, very approachable outside of class, extremely knowledgeable of the material, and make going to that early morning class quite enjoyable. There are also numerous learning opportunities outside of class as well. For instance, this past semester I got a job as a lab assistant, where I have been able to learn many new things in a more hands-on way. Countless other students are also doing research (which is very easy to get started in) or doing an internship in the area. Education is the fundamental reason why students go to college, and Pomona has definitely made that its priority.

Am learning a lot From day one the teachers are really excited about teaching. Many professors, while not able to get to know students in class, welcome office visits with open arms.

USD offers a wonderful education for a wonderful price. Am enjoying being here While the first few weeks are rough if you are a freshmen (the usual getting used to college kind of things) the community advisers on each floor really take the time to get to know students and make sure life is going ok. The student center (the MUC) has daily activities and movies on the weekends. Even though USD is in a small town, there is a lot to do if you look for it. Am learning a lot From day one the teachers are really excited about teaching. Many professors, while not able to get to know students in class, welcome office visits with open arms. The class variety makes it easy to explore options and get a taste of other majors. By the end of the semester students will feel like they have actually learned material, not just memorized it.

There is of course UWSB, the University of Washington Student Body (similar to ASB). This organization is dedicated to provide the best time you can have within the University. They take suggestions to what you would like to see, whether that is a program or an event. They listen to the opinions of students to construct the productivity of the school. Some clubs are available to those in housing. There is the Residential Housing Association (RHA) and the subcommittee of it; Housing Sustainability Committee (HSC). These organizations are there to plan and coordinate events. Whether you are interested in being a part of being Green within the community or simply want to help put together a celebration.', 'If you are interested in dance, agricultural, psychology, law, and programming, this school has a variety for you. These are some of the programs available at UWB; anything else is available to see on their main webpage http://www.uwb.edu/. If you like a smaller class environment, then this is perhaps one of the smaller sizes of student population at a university.', 'On the campus grounds, there is a group of interesting wooden figures. These monuments are known as the Guardians that watch over the campus. It goes along with the local lore that the guardians protect the local wetlands. The campus location is by wetlands to observe the local wildlife. Agricultural programs will be developed in the near future for interactions to learn about the life within Washington.', 'Whether it is playing outside in a friendly game of Frisbee or visiting a friend within the dorms, there is so much to do. If interested in the clubs, you help plan and coordinate events with fellow peers. There is also a local trail for joggers and bicyclists by a local park for those enjoy the outdoor activities.', 'There are a few choices for food on Campus. A Subway is located within the same building as the library. If you want to have a social gathering of friends, there is both Food for Thought and the small cafeteria in the UW2 Building. These are great choices to pick from if you are hungry and on break from a class. If you want to explore the area of Bothell, it is about a mile walk to get to the mini mall of Bothell. This area consists of small businesses, most of which are dinning places, some of which even accept Student discount.', 'Life in the dorm could not be any more fun. You have the options to choose either your own private dorm or share with other students. The types of room options available are single bedroom shared with two others, share a room with one other, or share a room with one other and two others in another room. Student placed together by the results of a quick poll that is taken prior to housing assignments. You are then best placed with another with similar options that you chose. This is to make the chances of you and your roommate get along with one another. -See more of special programs in Clubs and Activities section-', 'Those employed at the University of Washington Bothell Campus want to make you succeed. You will be given material that you will construct your understanding. In any given topic enrolled into, you will learn and retain at least a few ideas or concepts. The classes at the UWB are not to be skimmed, they contain information that can be vital to life around you. There are a numerous classes to choose. There is no reason to fall behind in your grades, this school is designed to educate you, not to get-by.', ""Be prepared to expand your mind of the program choices that are available. Be sure to lose that idea of procrastination, assignments become difficult after the second quarter. If you are dedicated to the readings and other assignments, you will have a fun and enjoyable time. If you are a freshman, take classes that interest you the most. Do not worry about determining your major right away, there will be time for that later on to decide. Do talk with your advisors in the office for it is their duty to help you succeed. Use the resources from the school to help you, programs available are the Quantitative Skill Center and the Writing Center. Of course, more programs are Careers finding, Finances, and Travel abroad. The library of the University is very helpful to you as a student. If you need a book or information but cannot find it, just ask the workers inside. Remember that these programs are for your usage, and you will enjoy the school's education and resources."", 'The atmospheres of the students and professors are very positive.

Just down the hill from the main part of campus we have a huge wetlands restoration project...great for science and environmental majors! If you go the opposite direction, there's a trail running through the forested area of campus, where you can see The Ancestors Sculpture and a few original houses still standing from when the entire campus was a farm."", ""At UW Bothell, you're paying a public school price for a private school education. Of course it's a deal! However, tuition costs keep rising at a ridiculous rate. Sooner or later, we could be paying as much as these private schools."", ""There's always events going on on-campus: holiday celebrations, movie nights, open mics, intercultural night, Bollywood night...and many more, with new events added every year. There's also becoming more and more clubs on campus--it's likely you'll find one that matches your interest."", ""There are two cafes on campus: Food For Thought, the cafe and student center in the U Bookstore, and Common Grounds, the cafe and common area in the UW2 building. They are good for a quick snack or coffee, but it's hard to get a full meal here on the cheap. There's also a Subway in the library building, but eating from there gets old quite fast. Because the school is so small and so many students are commuter students, there's really no cafeteria or dining hall. Sometimes it's better just to walk 8 minutes to Bothell's Main Street and get some Thai food."", ""Personally, I've never lived in the dorms. However, they are not your typical student housing.

However, the support and small class sizes make it a bit easier to learn and focus on your studies. The only thing notably different from other campuses is that some classes seem to have more relaxed midterms and finals. Relaxed meaning they aren't always a huge deal and usually consist of a paper or presentation (sometimes a quiz, too)."", ""Go into UW Bothell with an open mind- I came to the school dead-set on transferring and becoming a linguistics major. After my first year, I found that I was much more interested in two majors from the School of Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences: Global Studies and Media & Communication Studies. Also, I loved my professors and fellow students too much to leave. UW Bothell offers many things that large universities can't. The school is heavily invested in one-on-one student tutoring (writing center, math and science center, digital media tutoring) and on-campus jobs where students can learn from experience. Socially, UWB wouldn't be the top choice for a typical college experience, if that's what you're looking for (and you could be looking for the opposite!). There's no Greek system, limited dorms, and no party scene. As the school grows, however, more students are living on campus and developing a more social feel. Get in while you still can, it gets more competitive every year!"", 'UWB is a public university with a private school feel--small class sizes and a warm, tight-knit campus community.

How can you argue with that? Will enjoy being here To me the idea of living in Seattle itself is overwhelming, but Seattle has a lot to offer. Bothell is 15-20 minutes north of Seattle, so I will still have access to the big city without constantly being in it. I think the location will make it more enjoyable for people who like the city, but don't necessarily want to live in it. Will learn a lot University of Washington (Seattle) has an excellent reputation of education, so I am very pleased to know that many of the same professors also teach at the Bothell Campus.

So, I leave school before 4 (during fall and winter). That means all of the activities that tend to begin at 5 or later, are unavailable to me. Sucks, right? Not to mention, most of the clubs that I have any interest in meet when I have class (and it's chemistry so I can't exactly skip...). Therefore, nothing much for me to do... Although the new field is open to students (i think...)."", ""Like I said before. This campus is really small. Heck, the whole town is small. The Common Grounds and the Food for Thought is readily available but, again, over-priced for somewhat decent food. The food trucks that come by are pretty good, still over-priced, and they only stick around from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. There are some restaurants nearby in Main Street, Bothell but not many. If you're a picky eater, you're going to have problems. I only went to the Thai restaurant but there was also a Japanese restaurant, a diner, and a donut shop (you have to travel a little further though). About 15 minutes from the campus through a graveyard (not as creepy as it sounds). If you take a bus or drive, there is also a Starbucks, a Subway, and a teriyaki restaurant (next to Starbucks and tastes pretty good). Other than that, not much else without driving or taking a bus a few miles."", ""I don't live in a dorm but I visited a friend's dorm. The rooms were small and many of the students seemed to know each other. Learn to clean up after yourself. Your parents won't be picking up after you. You might want to also learn how to cook. As college students, we don't have a lot of money so cooking for yourself can probably save time. Also, make sure to establish some rules with your roommate. Friend or not, if one of you is okay with sharing food and the other isn't, you're going to have problems. Establish rules to help decide what is okay and what isn't. It will make dorm life much more comfortable."", ""Depending on the classes you take, college can be very hard or very easy. It also depends on the professors and your effort. If you skip a lot, don't pay attention in class, and procrastinate; you're going to fail. The professors are very easily accessible so be sure to ask questions and try to talk to them face-to-face rather than through email. DON'T PROCRASTINATE. Seriously. Just put in effort and you should do great. The campus has a lot of resources you can use to get help, so USE THEM."", ""Either learn to drive or become very familiar with bus routes. There isn't much very close to the school and the closest Starbucks is a short distance away. The Common Grounds and the Food for Thought has decent food but I you shouldn't expect too much. The food trucks that come are delicious but pretty over-priced. Much of the student activities are later in the evening after around 5. Lots of available clubs (apparently) but I haven't been to a single one because they tend to be during my class hours. So: learn to drive, maybe get a part-time job, and don't expect too much from this very new campus."", 'The University of Washington is a very small campus. It shares some resources with the Cascadia Community College and has small class sizes. The only real redeeming quality it has are that the professors are easier to connect with and that much of the facilities are new.']]",University of Washington-Bothell Campus Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Washington-Bothell-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,24,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00004-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911301443,911265051,HORIZONTAL,"{28130=Personally, I've never lived in the dorms.

For a comprehensive discussion of the role of credit cards as a medium for payment, see Kevin Foster, Erik Meijer, Scott Schuh, and Michael A. Zabek (2011), ""The 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice,"" Public Policy Discussion Series 11-1 (Boston: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, April), www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppdp/2011/ppdp1101.htmÃ‚Â  . Return to text, 63251=The data show that in the aggregate, credit limits on credit cards grew steadily in the period before the Great Recession, reaching a peak of about $3.7 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 before falling to about $2.7 trillion at the end of 2011 (data not shown in tables). 29 As the economy has recovered, aggregate credit limits have grown modestly, but they still remain about 25 percent below their peak value. Consistent with the large drop in the aggregate dollar amount of credit lines made available, credit record data also indicate that issuers have reduced limits on millions of credit card accounts, particularly accounts that were inactive or little used by cardholders. These data indicate that about 60 percent of the individuals who had at least one bankcard at the end of 2007 experienced a reduction in the aggregate limit available on all of their bankcards by the end of 2011. This estimate includes those individuals who had at least one bankcard account closed, which, all else being equal, would result in a lower aggregate limit. 30, 64449=Credit record data provide further insight into changes in individuals' aggregate credit limits in recent years. A review of these data finds that average aggregate dollar limits on bankcards vary with the credit risk posed by the cardholder and respond to changing economic circumstances. Individuals with lower credit scores have substantially smaller aggregate limits available to them than do individuals with higher scores. For example, at the end of 2011, bankcard holders with credit scores that placed them in the lowest quartile of all people with credit scores had an average aggregate credit limit across all of their bankcards of about $7,600 (figure 5). By contrast, those with scores that placed them in the highest quartile typically had an aggregate credit limit of about $33,200. This pattern holds across time; the data show the same basic relationship for each of the years reviewed. Credit record data also indicate that bankcard issuers curtailed limits (including by closing accounts) as the recession took hold, particularly for those with better credit scores. The cut in limits for those with higher scores may have been larger because such individuals tend to use their cards less and to have larger numbers of cards that they rarely use., 275359=The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act) is a federal statute intended to establish fair and transparent practices for the extension of credit under open-end credit plans, including credit card accounts. The Credit Card Act amended the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) and was implemented under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Z in three phases, with implementation dates of August 20, 2009; February 22, 2010; and August 22, 2010, for the various provisions. 1 Responsibility for TILA transferred from the Federal Reserve Board to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on July 21, 2011., 68683=Direct mail solicitation is an important channel for card issuers to acquire new credit card accounts and retain existing accounts. 33 After reaching an all-time annual high of 6.8 billion in 2005, mail solicitations for general-purpose credit cards fell sharply as the Great Recession took hold (derived from figure 6). 34 The effects of the weak economic environment, including surging delinquencies and losses on credit card activities, led card issuers to mail only about 1.5 billion solicitations in 2009. Industry data indicate that the retrenchment in mail solicitations began to reverse in the latter portion of 2009, as prospects for economic recovery improved. Mailing volumes continued to recover throughout 2010, increasing 128 percent from December 2009 to December 2010 (data not shown in tables). Overall, nearly 3.0 billion mail solicitations were sent out in 2010, and another 4.2 billion in 2011., 288352=18. See Bricker and others, ""Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2007 to 2010,"" in note 16. Return to text, 119215=An individual's attitudes about alternatives for purchase and consumption reflect his or her orientations toward or against those alternatives. These orientations may affect subsequent information processing and behavior. The 2012 survey asked respondents whether they thought using credit cards was a ""good thing"" or a ""bad thing."" Their attitudes toward credit cards differed by their credit behavior. Cardholders making greater use of their credit cards for borrowing were likely to view credit cards as bad: Considerably more than half of cardholders who hardly ever paid in full and of those who sometimes or hardly ever made more than minimum payments said that credit cards were bad or bad with qualifications (table 5). In contrast, cardholders who sometimes or almost always paid in full were more divided in their views. A little more than half of each group said that credit cards were good or good with qualifications. Nearly all of the rest of these cardholders said that credit cards were bad or bad with qualifications. The more critical view of credit cards among those who hardly ever paid in full and those who sometimes or hardly ever paid more than the minimum suggests that these heavy credit users may be predisposed to undertake more deliberative decision processes than transactions users, although the qualified positive responses of transactions users also suggest that they, too, may be deliberative., 285039=10. The Supreme Court's decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation, 439 U.S. 299 (1978), allowed banks to charge out-of-state borrowers local rates. In 1980, South Dakota deregulated interest rates, and Delaware did so in 1981. Many other states deregulated interest rates in the next year. Return to text, 52315=Although delinquency rates on credit cards tend to be relatively high even in good economic times, the recent recession triggered a significant upswing in delinquencies and charge-offs. The delinquency rate on bankcards reached just over 5 percent of the number of outstanding accounts in June 2009 (the official end of the Great Recession), receding to about 3 percent by the end of 2011 (figure 3). 23 In contrast, delinquency rates on closed-end consumer credit (such as automobile loans) peaked at about 4 percent during the recession before falling to about 2 to 3 percent during the recovery., 274277=Finally, cardholders were asked for their opinion on the statement, ""Most people read their Truth in Lending statements carefully."" Agreement with this statement trended upward from 1977 to 2001 but fell dramatically from 49 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2012. The change in the percentage of cardholders who disagreed strongly with the statement was equally dramatic: It increased from 24 percent in 2001 to 53 percent in 2012. The disclosure law's requirements have been accretive since its inception. It appears that as perceptions of TILA's complexity and doubts about the usefulness of some of the disclosures it requires have increased, cardholders' attitudes toward the law have become less positive over the years. 52, 249874=Despite their pessimistic views about other consumers, cardholders were fairly confident in their own dealings with credit card companies. Almost all cardholders believed that their credit card companies treated them fairly and were satisfied in their dealings with credit card companies, although only about half of the respondents held these beliefs strongly. The vast majority of all cardholders also felt confident that they could obtain credit from another credit card company if they became dissatisfied with any of their present card providers. The survey responses suggest that in 2012 many cardholders were a little less positive in their attitudes toward credit card companies and less confident of the ease of obtaining a credit card from another company than they had been in 2000. These opinions seem consistent with the tightening of credit standards associated with the recession and the Credit Card Act., 57549=To gain insight into the extent to which different economic environments may have influenced bankcard holder behavior, we examined cardholder payment performance across groups of states categorized according to changes in their job market conditions. For this exercise, we compared the rates of delinquency lasting 60 days or more among cardholders residing in states that experienced particularly poor employment markets with the delinquency rates of those residing in states that had relatively better outcomes. Specifically, we compared the bankcard delinquency rates of the residents of the 10 states that experienced the largest percentage increase in their unemployment rate from the end of 2007 to the end of 2010 with the delinquency rates of the residents of the 10 states that experienced the smallest percentage increase over this period. 25 The bankcard delinquency rate for the nation as a whole was calculated as a point of reference., 287660=16. See Jesse Bricker, Arthur B. Kennickell, Kevin B. Moore, and John Sabelhaus (2012), ""Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2007 to 2010: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"" Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 98 (June), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/default.htm. Return to text, 20077=Protecting consumers in their financial transactions has been a long-standing goal of government policy. At the federal level, the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) was the first in a series of statutes seeking to protect consumers in their use of credit. 6 Historically, TILA's focus has been on requiring clear and consistent disclosure of key terms of credit arrangements and associated credit costs. In this regard, TILA prescribes uniform methods for computing the cost of credit across different loan products, disclosing credit terms, and resolving errors such as those related to billing and payments. TILA has been amended over the years, most recently by the Credit Card Act with regard to its provisions on credit cards., 235909=1. The question read ""would be"" in 2000 and ""is"" in 2012. This change reflects a revision to Truth in Lending that requires disclosure of months to repay if only the minimum payment is made.Ã‚Â Return to table, 296192=30. The incidence of line curtailment presented here is based on an analysis that tracked the same individuals from the end of 2007 to the end of 2011. Some additional individuals may have entered the credit record files between these dates and also experienced a reduction in their total available bankcard limit. Statistics are derived from the CCP data. Return to text, 29993=Credit cards have become an important method of payment and a significant source of consumer credit. 13 In 2011, bankcards were used for over 22 billion transactions involving purchases of goods and services valued at an estimated $2.1 trillion. 14 Although down about 16 percent from its historical high, revolving credit outstanding was $847.3 billion and constituted 32 percent of consumer credit outstanding at the end of 2011 (derived from figure 1). Part of the growth in revolving credit has come from the substitution of credit card debt for some types of nonrevolving consumer credit, especially loans previously used to finance purchases of relatively less expensive household durables, such as furniture, home appliances, and entertainment devices. Also contributing to the growth in revolving credit was an increase in the use of so-called convenience credit--that is, credit used for transaction purposes such that monthly charges are paid in full at the end of the billing cycle. 15, 220076=Source: For 1970 and 1977, Federal Reserve Board, Survey of Consumer Finances; for 2000 and 2012, Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers., 38861=Consumers who pose an elevated credit risk often seek credit to support greater current consumption and sometimes resort to unsecured, high-rate credit products, which may include some bankcards, to augment their secured borrowing. In seeking to augment their borrowing, such consumers signal that they pose a higher risk of default and often find it difficult to obtain additional credit. One sign that a consumer is seeking additional credit is the presence of inquiries for credit in his or her credit record data. 19 For example, individuals who have relatively low credit scores have a notably higher incidence of credit inquiries in their files than those with higher credit scores, and they typically have more inquiries indicating that they are actively searching for more credit. As of the end of 2011, 68 percent of individuals with credit scores in the lowest 20 percent of the score distribution had a record of a credit inquiry in the previous 12 months in their credit history files, and, on average, these individuals had 3.3 inquiries (data not shown in tables). By comparison, less than 30 percent of those with credit scores in the top 20 percent of the score distribution had an inquiry in the previous 12 months, and, on average, these individuals had 1.6 inquiries., 280119=3.

Durkin (2000), ""Credit Cards: Use and Consumer Attitudes, 1970-2000,"" Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 86 (September), pp. 623-34, www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2000/00index.htm; Thomas A.

Durkin (2006), ""Credit Card Disclosures, Solicitations, and Privacy Notices: Survey Results of Consumer Knowledge and Behavior,"" Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 92 (August), pp. A109-A121, www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2006/06index.htm.

Return to text, 170258=Sixteen percent of cardholders responding to the 2012 survey had opened a new bankcard account in the previous 12 months. Reasons for opening a new account differed significantly by cardholders' payment behavior. Reasons related to availability and rates were reported most frequently by bankcard holders who only sometimes or hardly ever paid in full. Twenty-six percent of cardholders opening a new account who sometimes or hardly ever paid in full reported opening the account to rebuild or increase their available credit, and 19 percent opened the account to obtain a lower or zero interest rate (table 13). These responses are consistent with their payment behavior. The desire to receive rewards was mentioned most frequently by cardholders who almost always paid in full. Beyond the convenience in making payments, transactions users might reasonably be expected to seek cards with more generous rewards. Cardholders who almost always paid in full did not mention opening new accounts to rebuild or increase credit availability. Only 11 percent of these cardholders opened an account to obtain a lower or zero interest rate, which transactions users might rationally do on occasion., 250809=Cardholders believe that credit cards are useful to consumers generally. In 2012, nearly all cardholders believed that credit card companies provide a useful service to consumers. More than 60 percent of cardholders disagreed with the statement that consumers would be better off if there were no credit cards, and most of the rest did not feel strongly that this statement was true. These beliefs were little changed from 2000., 55116=Therefore, to gain a more comprehensive view of payment performance during the years of the Great Recession and the early recovery, we determined the number of cardholders who experienced some payment problem at any point during that period. For the analysis, we tracked a sample of individuals who were consistently included in the credit record files from the end of 2007 through the end of 2011 (this population is referred to here as the constant panel). Over this entire four-year period, about 20 percent of individuals with a bankcard in the constant panel fell behind on payments on one or more such cards by 30 days or more at least once (data not shown in tables). By comparison, at the end of 2009 (on a randomly selected single date within this four-year period), only 10 percent of individuals with a bankcard in the constant panel were in arrears by 30 days or more on at least one of their cards., 127077=Regardless of the definition considered, cardholders' awareness of APRs was very high in the 2012 survey. Among cardholders who sometimes paid in full, 92 percent were aware under the narrow definition, and 96 percent were aware under the broad definition (table 6). Eighty percent of cardholders who hardly ever paid in full were aware under the narrow definition. But if one allows for the possibility that these cardholders may have been paying low teaser rates--that is, if one adopts the broad definition--then up to 95 percent of cardholders who hardly ever paid in full may have been aware. The payment-behavior cohort with the lowest levels of awareness was the group of cardholders who almost always paid in full. Eighty-one percent of these cardholders were aware under the narrow definition, and 88 percent were aware under the broad definition. Cardholders who almost always paid in full were least likely to pay finance charges and therefore least likely to need to know their APR. Since APR information is not pertinent to their behavior, they may not retain the information in memory. In contrast, nearly all of the cardholders who actually paid finance charges were aware of their APR., 220265=Also notable is that the percentage of bankcard holders who said that credit card use was bad increased among those who hardly ever paid in full and those who hardly ever paid more than the minimum monthly payment. These behaviors can be relatively risky, making these consumers vulnerable to financial difficulties. Between 2000 and 2012, the percentage of cardholders who hardly ever paid balances in full and said that credit card use is bad increased 12 percentage points, from 59 percent to 71 percent, and the share of cardholders who hardly ever paid more than the minimum payment due rose 10 percentage points, from 63 percent to 73 percent (data not shown in tables). In contrast, among cardholders who almost always paid in full, the percentage viewing credit card use as bad did not change materially between 2000 and 2012. The change in attitudes of the former groups may reflect their experiences with delinquencies, which rose dramatically in the recent recession, and may have inhibited subsequent growth in revolving debt., 272916=The second statement on which respondents gave their opinion was, ""Some information in Truth in Lending statements is not very helpful."" Responses were similar to those for the first statement. The percentage of cardholders who agreed at least somewhat with this statement has also trended upward, from 59 percent in 1977 to 66 percent in 2001 and, most recently, 75 percent in 2012. These perceptions seem consistent with developments in the card market. Credit card regulation has tended to require disclosure of more information as new credit card products have been developed and features have been added to existing products. Also, some required disclosures may confuse consumers because the disclosures rely on unstated assumptions about consumers' future behavior. 51, 291911=24. Ezra D. Becker (2011), ""A Perspective on Credit Card Usage and Consumer Performance,"" paper presented at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conference on the Credit Card Act, Washington, D.C., February 22, www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/credit-card-act/card-act-conference-key-findings. Return to text, 66678=Credit limit curtailments did not appear to result in widespread constraints on cardholder access to credit. Despite the curtailment of credit lines, the credit record data indicate that at the end of 2011, in the aggregate, individuals were using only about one-fourth of the total dollar amount available on their lines under bank-issued credit card plans (data not shown in tables). Of course, such aggregate estimates mask considerable variability; some bankcard holders have very low rates of utilization (calculated as outstanding balances on all cards divided by the sum of the credit limits on all cards), while others are near or even over their limits as reflected in the credit record data. 31 For example, credit record data indicate that at the end of 2011 roughly one-fourth of bankcard holders had balances that were 80 percent or more of their available credit limit across all bankcards. 32 At the other extreme, about half of bankcard holders were using less than 20 percent of their available limit., 112431=The Surveys of Consumers reveal a trend since 2000 toward greater use of bankcards as a transaction medium rather than as a source of credit. In 2000, only 35 percent of bankcard holders reported that they paid their latest statement balance in full; in the 2012 survey this figure was 50 percent. Bankcard holders' reports of their habitual or usual behavior indicate the same trend. In 2000, 50 percent of bankcard holders said that they almost always paid the balance they owed in full; in 2012 the proportion was 62 percent. Part of the increase in transactions use has occurred since the recent recession and the implementation of the new credit card regulations. The percentage of bankcard holders who paid their latest statement balance in full increased 10 percentage points between 2005 and 2012. The proliferation of rewards cards likely contributed to the increase in the transactions use of credit cards. We do not have data for earlier years, but nearly three-fourths of bankcard holders reported that they had one or more cards with reward features in 2012. 37, 126118=This article uses the same awareness zones as those used to assess responses to the January 2000 Survey of Consumers in a Federal Reserve Bulletin article published the same year. 43 In that article, two definitions of awareness were considered. The first was a narrow definition, in which respondents reporting interest rates greater than 7.9 percent were classified as aware, and respondents reporting rates of 7.9 percent or lower or saying that they did not know the rate were classified as unaware. The second alternative was a broad definition recognizing that low teaser rates were common in the marketplace at that time, so reports of rates below 7.9 percent may have been accurate. Under the broad definition, respondents reporting any interest rate were classified as aware, and respondents reporting that they did not know their rate were classified as unaware., 25769=The following sections describe changes in credit card holding and use over time and issuer responses to the recent developments in the credit card market and the broader economy. This review provides background information for our analysis of responses to the February 2012 survey regarding consumers' recent experiences with and attitudes toward credit cards., 295626=29. Estimates are based on credit records included in the CCP data. See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2012), ""Delinquent Debt Shrinks While Real Estate Debt Continues to Fall,"" press release, February 27, www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/an120227.htmlÃ‚Â  . Return to text, 251253=Cardholders were decidedly more negative in their assessments of other consumers' satisfaction than of their own satisfaction with their credit card companies: Twenty-eight percent of cardholders disagreed somewhat and 21 percent disagreed strongly with the statement that most consumers were satisfied in their dealings with credit card companies. These assessments stand in stark contrast to their assessments of their own satisfaction with their own credit card issuers (only 4 percent disagreed somewhat and 1 percent disagreed strongly with the statement that they were satisfied in their dealings with their credit card companies; table 19) and are significantly more negative than those reported in 2000 (increases of 8 percentage points for cardholders who disagreed somewhat and 10 percentage points for cardholders who disagreed strongly that most consumers are satisfied in their dealings with credit card companies; table 20)., 249459=1. The question read ""would be"" in 2000 and ""is"" in 2012. This change reflects a revision to Truth in Lending that requires disclosure of months to repay if only the minimum payment is made.Ã‚Â Return to table, 273778=A third question asked whether cardholders agreed or disagreed with the statement, ""Truth in Lending makes people more confident when dealing with creditors."" Seventy-three percent of cardholders agreed somewhat or strongly with this statement in 1977. The percentage agreeing somewhat or strongly fell gradually over the next 24 years to 67 percent in 2001. The percentage agreeing somewhat or strongly fell 10 percentage points further in the 2000s to 57 percent in 2012., 9640=The credit card market has been further buffeted by new consumer protection regulations, most notably the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act). 2 The Credit Card Act sought to improve disclosure of account terms and conditions to consumers. The act also restricts a number of card issuer practices that the Congress deemed to be unfair, deceptive, or not sufficiently transparent. The provisions of the Credit Card Act were implemented in phases, but all are now in effect. Among the provisions of the act are limits on ""penalty"" fees for making late payments or exceeding credit limits; rules that specify how creditors must allocate consumer payments to outstanding balances; and restrictions on certain risk-management practices by card issuers, particularly limiting their ability to raise the interest rate on an outstanding balance unless the account payments are significantly in arrears or the interest rate on the account is variable (tied to an index). Each of these provisions affects the revenues and costs of card issuers. (For further details about the provisions of the Credit Card Act, see the box "" The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act.""), 284454=9. The Federal Reserve publishes estimates of consumer credit each month. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statistical Release G.19, ""Consumer Credit,"" www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/Current/. Revolving consumer credit consists of balances owed on credit cards and on unsecured personal lines of credit; it does not include home equity lines of credit or mortgage debt. The Federal Reserve first enumerated revolving consumer credit separately in 1968. Return to text, 283804=8. Authors' calculations from the 1970 Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. For more information about the survey, see University of Michigan, ""About the Survey,"" http://press.sca.isr.umich.edu/press/about_surveyÃ‚Â  (accessed October 28, 2013). The Survey of Consumer Finances first included questions on credit cards in 1970. Return to text, 31191=Most publicly available information about credit card holding and use is about individuals; however, since many financing decisions are made at the family level and attitudes and perspectives about credit cards may be formed based on collective experience, it is useful to consider the credit card-related activities of families. As of 2010, 68 percent of families had one or more credit cards (table 1). 16 That equated to about 152 million consumers (roughly two-thirds of individuals age 18 or older) holding about 520 million credit cards. 17 In 2010, about 39 percent of families with credit cards did not pay off their full statement balance each month, but rather paid a portion so that they carried an outstanding balance forward on their next statement. 18 Most families carrying credit card debt owed relatively small amounts. The median amount owed by families carrying debt on their credit cards was about $2,600; the average amount, however, was notably larger, at $7,100., 114175=The share of bankcard holders with relatively large amounts of bankcard debt is little changed since 2000. In that year, 33 percent of bankcard holders had $1,500 or more of bankcard debt, and 18 percent had $5,000 or more. In 2012, 35 percent had $1,500 or more of bankcard debt, and 19 percent had $5,000 or more. Use of relatively large amounts of debt was more common shortly before the recent recession than in 2000 or 2012, however. In 2005, 40 percent of bankcard holders had $1,500 or more of bankcard debt, and 24 percent had $5,000 or more. 38 That credit card debt was greater before the recession reflects the long-standing observation that consumers borrow more heavily during economic expansions, when prospects are good, and pay down debts during recessions., 156777=Hardly ever paying balances in full, and sometimes or hardly ever making more than minimum payments, is behavior that might occur if cardholders overestimate their ability to repay credit card debt. If so, and if paying high finance charges over long periods of time burdens them, then these cardholders might be expected to believe that credit cards make managing their finances more difficult. Responses to the 2012 survey do not provide much support for this hypothesis, however (table 11). Eighty-seven percent of cardholders who only sometimes paid in full and 85 percent of cardholders who hardly ever paid in full said that credit cards made managing their finances less difficult (compared with 80 percent of those who almost always paid in full). Among the cardholders who sometimes or hardly ever paid more than the minimum, 90 percent believed that credit cards made managing their finances less difficult. The percentage of cardholders who said they believed that credit cards made managing their finances more difficult increases as cardholders' tendency to pay in full becomes less frequent, but even among cardholders who hardly ever paid in full, only a relatively small share (14 percent) believed that credit cards made managing their finances more difficult., 11592=This article examines consumers' behavior, experiences, and attitudes with regard to credit cards in the aftermath of these economic and regulatory changes. Much of the data for this article are from a Federal Reserve-sponsored nationwide consumer survey conducted in February 2012 by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (Surveys of Consumers). Many of the questions posed in the survey were identical or similar to those asked on earlier surveys also sponsored by the Federal Reserve, making it possible to track changes over time in consumer knowledge, behavior, and attitudes about credit cards and to gain a more complete understanding of consumer experiences with this important financial product. 3 Because consumer attitudes and experiences with credit cards as reflected in responses to consumer surveys may be affected by conditions in the broader economy, we first present information from various sources about conditions in the credit card market prior to the consumer survey that was conducted in February 2012. Among the sources are credit record data and credit scores derived from these data, which shed light on recent changes in the credit card market, particularly as these changes relate to payment performance and access to credit. 4 We then examine responses to the consumer survey, taking into account some of the important differences found in how consumers use their credit cards and in their financial and other circumstances., 83211=Although bankcard holding declined somewhat in the wake of the recent recession and the implementation of the Credit Card Act, the majority of U.S. households continue to hold bankcards. Among households holding bankcards, the share having more than one such card (about one-fourth) has not changed much in recent years (table 4). However, the percentage of households having five or more bankcards appears to have decreased slightly (3 percentage points) since 2005., 58575=The analysis reveals variation in bankcard performance across the two groups of states as the Great Recession took hold and during the initial phases of the ensuing recovery. As one might expect, bankcard holders in states that experienced the largest percentage increase in their unemployment rate had worse payment performance than bankcard holders in the states that experienced the smallest increase in unemployment. From the end of 2007 to the end of 2010, bankcard holders in the 10 states with the poorest job performance experienced about a 10 percent increase in the rate of delinquency lasting 60 days or more, compared with a 3 percent decrease for bankcard holders in the 10 states with the strongest job markets. These outcomes are derived from the data portrayed in figure 4, which show a widening of the gap in delinquency rates between cardholders in the states that experienced poor employment outcomes and those in states with better outcomes., 155814=Bankcard holders' responses to a question asking whether credit cards make managing finances less difficult or more difficult provide evidence of cardholders' post-purchase evaluations of credit cards. Bankcard holders did generally believe that credit cards made managing their finances less difficult, and this belief was more widely held in 2012 than earlier (see table 4). Eighty-two percent of bankcard holders in 2012 said that bankcards made managing finances less difficult, compared with 72 percent in the 2001 survey. Only small percentages of respondents to both the 2012 and 2001 surveys believed that credit cards made managing their finances more difficult (8 percent and 10 percent, respectively). 45 A belief that cards make managing one's finances less difficult would seem inconsistent with the view that cards induce consumers to overestimate their ability to repay., 279756=1. The Great Recession dates from December 2007 through June 2009. Return to text, 40232=The result of these opposing supply and demand effects--the reluctance of lenders to extend unsecured credit to individuals who pose a higher credit risk and the elevated demand for such credit by such individuals--can be seen by examining data from a nationally representative sample of individuals drawn from credit record files. 20 Several relationships are revealed by an analysis of the credit record data. First, the share of individuals holding at least one bankcard was for many years quite stable, at about 80 percent, until the onset of the Great Recession; afterward, the incidence of cardholding fell to about 72 percent in 2010 (table 2). 21 (Note that the unit of observation in credit record data is the individual, not the household as in earlier analyses.) The reduction in the incidence of cardholding appears to have come from individuals in all credit score groups, although the largest percentage declines were among those with scores in the two lowest credit score quartiles (derived from data in table 2). Second, the incidence of cardholding is notably smaller in the two lowest credit score quartiles than in the two highest. At the end of 2011, about 53 percent of those in the lowest score quartile and about 65 percent of those in the second-lowest score quartile held a bankcard, compared with about 80 percent of those in the third quartile and 90 percent of those in the highest. The lower incidence of cardholding among those with lower scores means that most individuals with bankcards have fairly high credit scores: At the end of 2011, roughly 60 percent of all bankcard holders had a credit score that placed them in the top two quartiles of the score distribution., 76335=Although the volume of credit card mail solicitations is quite large, only a very small proportion of such solicitations result in an application for or the establishment of a new credit card account. To learn more about those who actually establish a new credit card account, one must look at data beyond mailings of solicitations for new cards. Using nationally representative samples of the credit records drawn as of June 30, 2007, and at the ends of 2008 and 2010, it is possible to profile the characteristics of individuals opening new bankcard accounts at different points in the business cycle. 36 These credit record data show that as the economy slid into recession there was a notable decrease in the share of individuals taking out new accounts who had credit scores in the lowest quartile, a pattern consistent with the change in mail solicitations. For example, over the six-month time frame of July to December 2008, 15 percent of the individuals opening new bankcard accounts had scores that fell in the lowest credit score quartile, a share down notably from the period preceding the recession: During the July to December 2006 period, the share of individuals opening new bankcard accounts with credit scores in the lowest quartile was 20 percent (table 3)., 189664=The February 2012 Survey of Consumers questioned bankcard holders about adverse experiences involving their credit cards during the 12-month period prior to the interview. Adverse experiences were defined to include actions such as denials or limitations of credit and increases in interest rates or fees. Some of these events may have been prompted by the high delinquency rates and credit losses experienced by card issuers during the recession or by regulatory changes, including those related to allowable risk-management practices and various forms of consumer protection. This section investigates the prevalence of adverse actions and examines how they may have affected consumer attitudes toward credit., 221844=Over 60 percent of cardholders believed strongly that credit card companies made too much credit available to most people, and 75 percent believed strongly that solicitations offering low rates for a short time confuse many people (table 19). These beliefs were held a little less strongly in 2012 than they were in 2000: The percentages of cardholders agreeing somewhat with these statements increased 8 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively, between 2000 and 2012 (table 20). However, the percentage of cardholders strongly believing that credit card companies made getting out of debt difficult increased about 6 percentage points, to 61 percent, over this time period., 26238=Although credit card holding increased rapidly after the introduction of credit cards in the 1950s, credit card-related borrowing accounted for a very small share of consumer credit for many years. As of 1970 just over half of U.S. households had one or more credit cards. 8 At that time, revolving credit totaled only $5.1 billion ($29.4 billion in constant 2012 dollars) and accounted for just 3.8 percent of total consumer credit outstanding (figure 1). 9 Credit card holding and use grew substantially in subsequent years. By 1977, nearly 63 percent of households had credit cards, and revolving credit had increased to $39.3 billion ($144.1 billion in constant 2012 dollars), a nearly fivefold increase in constant dollars; however, it still accounted for only a relatively small share of consumer credit., 211881=As mentioned, individuals' attitudes reflect their orientations toward or against alternatives for purchase and consumption, which may affect their behavior. Changes in attitudes may thus change behavior. The question on the Surveys of Consumers asking respondents whether using credit cards is a good or a bad thing has been asked several times over the years, beginning with the 1970 survey. As consumers have gained experience with credit cards, their opinions about credit card use have polarized. In 1970 about 65 percent of cardholders and 71 percent of consumers overall expressed an unqualified view that card use was either a ""good thing"" or a ""bad thing"" (table 18). In 2012 more than 95 percent of both cardholders and consumers overall expressed unqualified views about credit cards. Notably, the share of cardholders who viewed card use as a bad thing rose substantially between 2000 and 2012, while the share of cardholders viewing card use as a good thing was little changed., 304692=45. The ability to manage credit card accounts using the Internet may be one factor contributing to the rise in the percentage of bankcard holders who believed that bankcards made managing their finances easier. In 2012, 48 percent of bankcard holders reported having made a credit card payment using the Internet. Financial services have become more widely available on the Internet since 2000.

Understanding the Recent Rise in Credit Card Debt,"" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2004-47 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200447/200447abs.html. Return to text, 81990=Taken together, the data presented earlier reveal wide differences in credit card-related experiences and outcomes for individuals across a number of dimensions, including the economic conditions of their state of residence and one key measure of the credit risk they pose--their credit score. The following sections highlight findings from the February 2012 Survey of Consumers. The findings here indicate that credit risk was an important determinant of consumers' responses to the recession and the Credit Card Act. The survey responses identify consumers whose payment practices make them risky. Such patterns include hardly ever paying balances in full and hardly ever making more than minimum payments, behaviors that are associated with incurring relatively high credit card balances and making late payments relatively often. An examination of such cardholders' awareness of APRs, use of information, and decision processes provides insights on questions such as whether they systematically overestimate their ability to repay and whether their decisions are purposive and thoughtful., 115026=The feature of bankcard credit that allows cardholders to repay debt largely at their own discretion provides them with considerable flexibility in managing their accounts but is somewhat controversial. Critics of the feature contend that it leads some consumers to overestimate their ability to repay their credit card debt, causing them to consistently make only minimum payments and incur high finance charges for long periods of time. 39 The Credit Card Act addressed this concern by requiring new disclosures on monthly statements intended to encourage bankcard holders to make more than minimum payments. It is not evident from the survey results, however, that the new disclosure rules have altered consumer behavior. In 2012, 11 percent of bankcard holders said that they hardly ever made more than minimum payments, and 14 percent said that they sometimes made more than minimum payments. 40 This pattern is little different from the one revealed in the 2000 survey, which found that 9 percent of bankcard holders hardly ever made more than minimum payments and 11 percent sometimes made more than minimum payments. The next subsection discusses in greater detail consumers' use of information and credit card payment behavior using data from the 2012 survey., 283405=7. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), Report to the Congress on the Profitability of Credit Card Operations of Depository Institutions (Washington: Board of Governors, June), www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/credit-card-profitability-2013.htm. Return to text, 291063=23. Delinquency rates rose even more sharply when stated in dollar terms than when measured by the percentage of accounts. The elevated charge-offs associated with the Great Recession resulted in card issuers' experiencing negative returns on credit card activities in 2009, the first time issuers had had negative returns since at least 1986. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), Report to the Congress on the Profitability of Credit Card Operations of Depository Institutions (Washington: Board of Governors, June), www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/credit-card-profitability-2011.htm. Return to text, 300639=38. Just before the recession, data from the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances indicated that 41 percent of bankcard holders had $1,500 or more of bankcard debt, and 26 percent had $5,000 or more. See Brian K. Bucks, Arthur B. Kennickell, Traci L. Mach, and Kevin B. Moore (2009), ""Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"" Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 95 (February), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2009/articles/scf/default.htm. Return to text, 61994=Over the past few years issuers have repriced millions of bankcard accounts. Data representing a subset of the largest bankcard issuers indicate that many accounts experienced an increase in interest rates as a consequence of either late payments or changes in terms around the time when bankcard delinquencies increased coincident with the Great Recession and when the Credit Card Act rulemaking was in play. However, the share of accounts experiencing interest rate increases as a penalty or because of a change in terms dropped substantially once the provisions of the Credit Card Act took effect. For example, about 4 percent of bankcard accounts experienced an increase in their APR because of a penalty or change in terms each quarter in the first half of 2008, but this share dropped to about 1.5 percent each quarter by the second half of 2010. 27 Also, the incidence of late fees and the typical amount of such fees fell once the provisions of the Credit Card Act became effective. 28, 74389=Another way to demonstrate the changing risk tolerance of issuers of general-purpose credit cards is to consider the share of individuals in each credit score quartile who received a mail solicitation. Consistent with the overall volume of mailings, all score groups experienced a falloff in solicitations as the recession emerged, but those in the lower score bands experienced a much sharper decline. The data show that in June 2007 about 59 percent of individuals with scores in the bottom quartile received at least one mail solicitation; by January 2011 that share had fallen to 19 percent (figure 8). By comparison, in June 2007, about 58 percent of those with scores in the highest quartile received a solicitation; in January 2011 that figure was about 55 percent. Mailings to individuals with credit scores in the lowest two quartiles recovered some over the course of 2011 after reaching their low points., 124960=Presumably, use of information on account terms is part of cardholders' deliberative process. Because awareness of price is a prerequisite for informed use of credit, price disclosure is a key component of federal disclosure rules for consumer credit and a focal point for researchers studying the effect of awareness of price on credit decisions. 42 Since the implementation of TILA in 1968, the price of credit has been measured by the APR, and researchers have used survey reports of APRs to investigate consumer awareness of credit costs. Because the APRs reported by respondents in interview surveys cannot be checked against the rates they actually pay, researchers have relied on the concept of ""awareness zones"" to measure knowledge of APRs. If a respondent reports an APR within a range that is deemed reasonable based on the distribution of actual market rates, the respondent is classified as ""aware."" If the respondent reports a rate that is outside the range or answers ""do not know,"" the respondent is classified as ""unaware."", 56895=The Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax (CCP) data can offer further insight into the payment experiences of cardholders. Although the Great Recession and the ensuing recovery have been national phenomena, cardholders in different areas of the country have experienced considerably different economic environments, which may have affected their willingness or ability to meet their debt obligations, including credit card payments. As noted, the economic environments different individuals have encountered and their personal experiences may have influenced their responses to the February 2012 consumer survey., 72024=The share of individuals receiving general-purpose credit card mail offers has varied over time, primarily reflecting broad economic conditions. The penetration rate reached about 63 percent of individuals around the middle of 2007 before falling to a low point of 27 percent in August 2009 as issuers responded to increasing delinquencies and losses in the credit card market (data not shown in tables). The mail solicitation data also reveal a sharp reduction once the recession took hold in offers to individuals posing a higher expected risk of default (those with lower credit scores). In June 2007, about 11 percent of credit card solicitations were sent to individuals with credit scores in the lowest quartile (figure 7). Mailings to such individuals fell sharply after that, reaching a low point in January 2011, when only 2 percent of mailings were sent to individuals with the lowest scores. More broadly, the share of all mailings sent to individuals with credit scores in the bottom half of the score distribution fell from 43 percent in June 2007 to only 16 percent in January 2011. After the beginning of 2011, card issuers' risk tolerance appears to have recovered some, as the share of mailings received by those in the bottom half of the score distribution increased, reaching 23 percent in December 2011., 306826=49. Analysis of credit record data indicates that of the bankcard holders who fell behind on their payments by 30 days or more at least once from the end of 2007 to the end of 2010, over two-thirds subsequently experienced a reduction in their aggregate credit limit across all of their cards. Return to text, 279919=2. The Credit Card Act (Pub. L. No. 111-24, 123 Stat. 1734 (2009)) was signed into law on May 22, 2009. Return to text, 301338=39. See, for example, Lawrence M.

Return to text, 113583=The increase in transactions use may also include broader adoption of this pattern of use among bankcard holders who previously owed relatively small amounts of bankcard debt. In 2000, 32 percent of bankcard holders owed $1 to $4,999 (in constant 2012 dollars) after their most recent payment; in 2012, the share had fallen to 16 percent. Once revolving balances are repaid, cardholders may continue to use their bankcards for the sake of convenience in making transactions and in order to receive credits for rewards while paying balances in full on their monthly statements., 70657=Whether measured before, during, or after the most recent recession, the number of mail solicitations has been large. However, aggregate mail-volume figures reflect the receipt of multiple offers by the same individual, sometimes for the same card from the same card issuer. Another way to portray the extent of mail solicitations and their reach into the overall population is to measure the penetration rate--that is, the share of individuals who received at least one credit card mailing during a given period (for example, over the course of a month or a calendar quarter). A portion of the mail solicitation data available for such an analysis has been linked to the credit records of the individuals receiving the solicitations, so it is possible to assess the change over time in mailings to individuals grouped into credit score quartiles. 35 The mail solicitation data available for this analysis that include credit scores are limited to mailings received in calendar year 2007 and from the middle of 2009 onward; our analysis used data through the end of 2011. We considered both the overall penetration rate (beginning in 2007) and the distribution of mailings received by individuals grouped into credit score quartiles for the months in which the data are available., 252397=On several occasions since 1977, Federal Reserve-sponsored Surveys of Consumers have asked consumers about their views regarding disclosures required by TILA. One series of questions asked consumers about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with several statements about these disclosures. First, cardholders were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement, ""Truth in Lending statements are complicated."" Agreement with this statement has trended upward over the years. In 1977, 38 percent of cardholders agreed strongly with this statement, and 73 percent agreed strongly or somewhat (table 21). In 2012, the percentage of consumers agreeing strongly with the statement increased to 52 percent, and the percentage agreeing strongly or somewhat increased to 86 percent., 295096=28. See the slides regarding changes in penalty fees and over-the-limit fees in Jennifer Faulkner (2011), ""The CARD Act--One Year Later: Impact on Pricing Fees"" (Washington: Department of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Administrator of National Banks), http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/2011/03/OCC-Presentation.pdf. Return to text}","Mon, 24 Feb 2014 15:50:12 GMT","For both cardholders who almost always paid in full and cardholders who sometimes or hardly ever paid in full, the source of initial information about the new account was most frequently a salesperson in a store--28 percent and 36 percent, respectively (table 14). This result reflects the prevalence of accounts opened to make specific purchases or obtain purchase discounts or also, for the latter group, to receive low or zero interest rates. Mail solicitations were important sources of information for cardholders who sometimes or hardly ever paid in full; 33 percent of these respondents initially learned about an account from a mail solicitation. This percentage is three times greater than the share of cardholders who almost always paid in full who received initial information from mail solicitations. That those who revolve balances are more likely than transactions users to respond to mail solicitations is consistent with the observation that respondents to mail solicitations are riskier than nonrespondents, which supports the hypothesis of adverse selection in the credit card market. 47 Cardholders who almost always paid in full were more likely to obtain initial information from a bank employee or the Internet. The reason for opening a new account most frequently mentioned by bankcard holders who almost always paid in full was to receive rewards (33 percent).

The first question asked how carefully they read the information. A little more than two-thirds of those who almost always paid in full and nearly three-fourths of those who sometimes or hardly ever paid in full read the account disclosure information at least somewhat carefully (table 15). 48 Regardless of payment behavior, by far the majority of new cardholders filed the information away for possible future use, including some cardholders who did not read the information very carefully.

In just this past 3Q 2010, nearly 400 clients have moved over to IBM -- almost all of them from Oracle/Sun and HP. Of these, 286 clients migrated to IBM Power Systems, running AIX, Linux and IBM i operating systems, from competitors alone -- nearly 175 from Oracle/Sun and nearly 100 from HP. The number of migrations to IBM Power Systems through the first three quarters of 2010 is nearly 800, already exceeding the total for all of last year by more than 200., 199363=Randy reported that IBM had its best quarter ever for the XIV, reflecting an unexpected surge shortly after my blog post debunking the DDF myth last April. He presented successful case studies of client deployments. Many followed a familiar pattern. First, the client would only purchase one or two XIV units. Second, the client would beat the crap out of them, putting all kinds of stress from different workloads. Third, the client would discover that the XIV is really as amazing as IBM and IBM Business Partners have told them. Finally, in the fourth phase, the client would deploy the XIV for mission-critical production applications., 248663=They say ""Great Minds think alike"" and that imitation is ""the sincerest form of flattery."" Both of these quotes came to mind when I read fellow blogger Chuck Hollis' (EMC) excellent April 7th blog post [The 10 Big Ideas That Are Shaping IT Infrastructure Today]. Not surprisingly, some of his thoughts are similar to those I had presented two weeks ago in my March 22nd post [Cloud Computing for Accountants]. Here are two charts that caught my eye:, 241497=This wraps up the week for me. I have to pack the XIV back into the crate, and drive back to Tucson. IBM plans to host another Executive Summit in the September/October time frame on the East coast., 130842=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], we had receptions on the Show floor. This started at the Monday evening reception and went on through a dessert reception Wednesday after lunch. I worked the IBM booth, and also walked around to make friends at other booths., 60259=Since 2007, IBM has been able to double computer processing capability without increasing energy consumption or carbon gas emissions., 205282=Several members of the XIV team thanked me for my April 5th post [Double Drive Failure Debunked: XIV Two Years Later]. Since April 5th, IBM has sold more XIV units this quarter than any prior quarters. I am glad to have helped!, 158945=Each quarter since 2006, the [IBM Migration Factory] team has tallied the number of clients who have moved to IBM severs and storage systems from competitive hardware. We'll I've just seen the latest numbers, for the third quarter of 2010, and it looks like we set a new quarterly record with nearly 400 total migrations to IBM from Oracle/Sun and HP., 236094=Neil Jarvis, CIO of American Automobile Association (AAA) for Northern California, Nevada and Utah (NCNU), provided the customer testimonial. Last September, the [AAA NCNU selected IBM] to build them an energy-efficient green data center. Neil provided us an update now six months later, managing the needs of 4 million drivers., 218848=With EMC, however, the motivation appeared to protect software revenues from their PowerPath multi-pathing driver, TimeFinder and SRDF copy services. Back in 2005, when EMC Invista was first announced, these three software represented 60 percent of EMC's bottom-line profit. (Ok, I made that last part up, but you get my point! EMC charges a lot for these.), 219227=Back in 2006, fellow blogger Chuck Hollis (EMC) suggested that SVC was just a [bump in the wire] which could not possibly improve performance of existing disk arrays. IBM showed clients that putting cache(SVC) in front of other cache(back end devices) does indeed improve performance, in the same way that multi-core processors successfully use L1/L2/L3 cache. Now, EMC is claiming their cache-based VPLEX improves performance of back-end disk. My how EMC's story has changed!, 67729=This post concludes my series of posts on Oracle OpenWorld 2011 conference. Here are some pictures from Wednesday and Thursday., 160014=Let's do the math.... Since IBM established its Migration Factory program in 2006, more than 4,500 clients have switched to IBM. More than 1,000 from Oracle/Sun and HP joined the exodus this year alone. In less than five years, almost 3,000 of these clients -- including more than 1,500 from Oracle/Sun and more than 1,000 from HP -- have chosen to run their businesses on IBM's Power Systems. That's more than a client per day making the move to IBM!, 146356=The analysts predict that IBM will be the first to deliver 40 GbE, from their BNT acquisition. They predict by 2014 that Ethernet approaches (NAS, iSCSI, FCoE) will be the core technology for all but the largest SANs, and that iSCSI and NAS will be more widespread than FCoE. As for cabling, the analysts recommend copper within the rack, but fiber optic between racks. Consider SAN management software, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Productivity Center., 168157=Certainly, this debate is not new. In my now infamous 2007 post [Supermarkets and Specialty Shops], I explained that there were clients that preferred to get their infrastructure from a single IT supermarket, like IBM or HP, while others were lured into thinking that buying separate parts from butchers, bakers and candlestick makers and other specialty shops was somehow a better idea., 175064=Back in 2007, I mentioned how IBM's fully-integrated InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse [Trounced HP and Sun]. For business analytics, IBM offers the fully-integrated [IBM Smart Analytics Systems]. Today, IBM expanded its line of fully-integrated private cloud service delivery platforms with the announcement of the [IBM CloudBurst for on Power Systems], which does for POWER7 what the IBM CloudBurst for System x, Oracle Exalogic, or Acadia's V-block, do for x86. IBM estimates that private clouds built on Power systems can be up to 70 percent less expensive than stand alone x86 servers., 98778=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Thursday morning had some interesting sessions for those that did not leave town last night., 114622=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Wendesday afternoon included a mix of sessions that covered storage and servers., 186907=There are lots of analysts that track market share for the IT storage industry, but since Chuck mentions [IDC] specifically, I reviewed the most recent IDC data, published a few weeks ago in their ""IDC Worldwide Quarter Disk Storage Tracker"" for 2Q 2010, representing April 1 to June 30, 2010 sales. Just in case any of the rankings have changed over time, I also looked at the previous four quarters: 2Q 2009, 3Q 2009, 4Q 2009 and 1Q 2010., 121446=UNIX vendors must make the ""mainframe argument"" that their flavor of UNIX is more resilient than any OS that runs on Intel or AMD x86 chipsets. In 2008, Sun Solaris was the number #1 UNIX, but today, it is IBM AIX with 40 percent marketshare. Meanwhile HP has focused on extending its Windows/x86 lead with a partnership with Microsoft., 198395=Continuing coverage of my week in Washington DC for the annual [2010 System Storage Technical University], I attended several XIV sessions throughout the week. There were many XIV sessions. I could not attend all of them. Jack Arnold, one of my colleagues at the IBM Tucson Executive Briefing Center, often presents XIV to clients and Business Partners. He covered all the basics of XIV architecture, configuration, and features like snapshots and migration. Carlos Lizarralde presented ""Solving VMware Challenges with XIV"". Ola Mayer presented ""XIV Active Data Migration and Disaster Recovery""., 290945=To learn more about IBM results 4Q09 and full-year 2009, see [Quarterly Earnings]., 311024=GPFS can support AIX, Linux, and Windows! Version 3.3 adds support for Windows 2008 Server on 64-bit chipset architectures from AMD and Intel. Now you can have a common GPFS cluster with AIX, Linux and Windows servers all sharing and accessing the same files. A GPFS cluster can have up to 256 file systems. Each of these file systems can be up to 1 billion files, up to 1PB of data, and can have up to 256 snapshots. GPFS can be used stand-alone, or integrated with a full IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) unified recovery management solution with parallel backup streams., 226684=technorati tags: IBM, SVC, 2145-CF8, SSD, FlashCopy, Metro+Mirror, Global+Mirror, EMC, VPLEX, CLARiiON, Symmetrix, VMAX, storage, virtualization, non-disruptive, HDS, USP-V, USP-VM, HP, SVSP,, 287807=Some analysts predict that by 2013, one out of five companies won't even have their own IT assets. IBM supports all flavors of private, public and hybrid cloud computing models. IBM has its own strong set of offerings, is also the number one reseller of VMware, and has cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon. HP and Microsoft have recently formed an alliance, but they have different takes on cloud computing. HP wants to be the ""infrastructure"" company, but Microsoft wants to focus on its [""three screens and a public cloud""] strategy. Microsoft has decided not to make its Azure Cloud operating system available for private cloud deployments. By contrast, IBM can start you with a private cloud, then help you transition to a hybrid cloud, and finally to a public cloud., 107074=The analyst mentioned EMC's failed product Invista, which sold less than 500 units over the past five years. The low penetration for external virtualization, estimated between 2-5 percent, could be explained from the bad taste that left in everyone considering their options. However, the analyst predicts that by 2015, external virtualization will reach double digit marketshare., 215611=Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions. IT storage can be expensive, so companies would like their new purchases to be fully utilized on day 1, and be completely empty on day 1500 when the lease expires. I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array., 141290=Mastering the art of stretching out a week-long event into two weeks' worth of blog posts, I continue my coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Tuesday afternoon I attended several sessions that focused on technologies for Cloud Computing., 40403=Today, IBM announced [IBM PureSystems], a new family of expert-integrated systems that combine storage, servers, networking, and software, based on IBM's decades of experience in the IT industry. You can register for the [Launch Event] today (April 11) at 2pm EDT, and download the companion ""Integrated Expertise"" event app for Apple, Android or Blackberry smartphones.}","Fri, 29 May 2015 03:52:22 GMT","Before VPLEX, here is a breakdown of each solution: A solution to make the data migration non-disruptive would benefit the clients (make it easier for their IT staff to keep their data center modern and current) as well as the vendors (reduce the obstacle of selling and deploying new features and functions). Storage virtualization can be employed to help solve this problem. I define virtualization as ""technology that makes one set of resources look and feel like a different set of resources, preferably with more desirable characteristics."". By making different storage resources, old and new, look and feel like a single type of resource, migration can be performed without disrupting applications. Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions. IT storage can be expensive, so companies would like their new purchases to be fully utilized on day 1, and be completely empty on day 1500 when the lease expires. I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array. Problem: migration from old gear to new gear, old technology to new technology, from one vendor to another vendor, is disruptive, time-consuming and painful. Let's start with the problem we are trying to solve.","For IBM, the motivation was clear: Protect customers existing investment in older storage arrays and introduce new IBM storage with a solution that allows both to be managed with a single set of interfaces and provide a common set of functionality, improving capacity utilization and availability. IBM SAN Volume Controller eliminated vendor lock-in, providing clients choice in multi-pathing driver, and allowing any-to-any migration and copy services. For example, IBM SVC can be used to help migrate data from an old HDS USP-V to a new HDS USP-V. With EMC, however, the motivation appeared to protect software revenues from their PowerPath multi-pathing driver, TimeFinder and SRDF copy services. Back in 2005, when EMC Invista was first announced, these three software represented 60 percent of EMC's bottom-line profit. (Ok, I made that last part up, but you get my point!

In just this past 3Q 2010, nearly 400 clients have moved over to IBM -- almost all of them from Oracle/Sun and HP. Of these, 286 clients migrated to IBM Power Systems, running AIX, Linux and IBM i operating systems, from competitors alone -- nearly 175 from Oracle/Sun and nearly 100 from HP. The number of migrations to IBM Power Systems through the first three quarters of 2010 is nearly 800, already exceeding the total for all of last year by more than 200., 199363=Randy reported that IBM had its best quarter ever for the XIV, reflecting an unexpected surge shortly after my blog post debunking the DDF myth last April. He presented successful case studies of client deployments. Many followed a familiar pattern. First, the client would only purchase one or two XIV units. Second, the client would beat the crap out of them, putting all kinds of stress from different workloads. Third, the client would discover that the XIV is really as amazing as IBM and IBM Business Partners have told them. Finally, in the fourth phase, the client would deploy the XIV for mission-critical production applications., 248663=They say ""Great Minds think alike"" and that imitation is ""the sincerest form of flattery."" Both of these quotes came to mind when I read fellow blogger Chuck Hollis' (EMC) excellent April 7th blog post [The 10 Big Ideas That Are Shaping IT Infrastructure Today]. Not surprisingly, some of his thoughts are similar to those I had presented two weeks ago in my March 22nd post [Cloud Computing for Accountants]. Here are two charts that caught my eye:, 241497=This wraps up the week for me. I have to pack the XIV back into the crate, and drive back to Tucson. IBM plans to host another Executive Summit in the September/October time frame on the East coast., 130842=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], we had receptions on the Show floor. This started at the Monday evening reception and went on through a dessert reception Wednesday after lunch. I worked the IBM booth, and also walked around to make friends at other booths., 60259=Since 2007, IBM has been able to double computer processing capability without increasing energy consumption or carbon gas emissions., 205282=Several members of the XIV team thanked me for my April 5th post [Double Drive Failure Debunked: XIV Two Years Later]. Since April 5th, IBM has sold more XIV units this quarter than any prior quarters. I am glad to have helped!, 158945=Each quarter since 2006, the [IBM Migration Factory] team has tallied the number of clients who have moved to IBM severs and storage systems from competitive hardware. We'll I've just seen the latest numbers, for the third quarter of 2010, and it looks like we set a new quarterly record with nearly 400 total migrations to IBM from Oracle/Sun and HP., 236094=Neil Jarvis, CIO of American Automobile Association (AAA) for Northern California, Nevada and Utah (NCNU), provided the customer testimonial. Last September, the [AAA NCNU selected IBM] to build them an energy-efficient green data center. Neil provided us an update now six months later, managing the needs of 4 million drivers., 218848=With EMC, however, the motivation appeared to protect software revenues from their PowerPath multi-pathing driver, TimeFinder and SRDF copy services. Back in 2005, when EMC Invista was first announced, these three software represented 60 percent of EMC's bottom-line profit. (Ok, I made that last part up, but you get my point! EMC charges a lot for these.), 219227=Back in 2006, fellow blogger Chuck Hollis (EMC) suggested that SVC was just a [bump in the wire] which could not possibly improve performance of existing disk arrays. IBM showed clients that putting cache(SVC) in front of other cache(back end devices) does indeed improve performance, in the same way that multi-core processors successfully use L1/L2/L3 cache. Now, EMC is claiming their cache-based VPLEX improves performance of back-end disk. My how EMC's story has changed!, 67729=This post concludes my series of posts on Oracle OpenWorld 2011 conference. Here are some pictures from Wednesday and Thursday., 160014=Let's do the math.... Since IBM established its Migration Factory program in 2006, more than 4,500 clients have switched to IBM. More than 1,000 from Oracle/Sun and HP joined the exodus this year alone. In less than five years, almost 3,000 of these clients -- including more than 1,500 from Oracle/Sun and more than 1,000 from HP -- have chosen to run their businesses on IBM's Power Systems. That's more than a client per day making the move to IBM!, 146356=The analysts predict that IBM will be the first to deliver 40 GbE, from their BNT acquisition. They predict by 2014 that Ethernet approaches (NAS, iSCSI, FCoE) will be the core technology for all but the largest SANs, and that iSCSI and NAS will be more widespread than FCoE. As for cabling, the analysts recommend copper within the rack, but fiber optic between racks. Consider SAN management software, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Productivity Center., 168157=Certainly, this debate is not new. In my now infamous 2007 post [Supermarkets and Specialty Shops], I explained that there were clients that preferred to get their infrastructure from a single IT supermarket, like IBM or HP, while others were lured into thinking that buying separate parts from butchers, bakers and candlestick makers and other specialty shops was somehow a better idea., 175064=Back in 2007, I mentioned how IBM's fully-integrated InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse [Trounced HP and Sun]. For business analytics, IBM offers the fully-integrated [IBM Smart Analytics Systems]. Today, IBM expanded its line of fully-integrated private cloud service delivery platforms with the announcement of the [IBM CloudBurst for on Power Systems], which does for POWER7 what the IBM CloudBurst for System x, Oracle Exalogic, or Acadia's V-block, do for x86. IBM estimates that private clouds built on Power systems can be up to 70 percent less expensive than stand alone x86 servers., 98778=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Thursday morning had some interesting sessions for those that did not leave town last night., 114622=Continuing my post-week coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Wendesday afternoon included a mix of sessions that covered storage and servers., 186907=There are lots of analysts that track market share for the IT storage industry, but since Chuck mentions [IDC] specifically, I reviewed the most recent IDC data, published a few weeks ago in their ""IDC Worldwide Quarter Disk Storage Tracker"" for 2Q 2010, representing April 1 to June 30, 2010 sales. Just in case any of the rankings have changed over time, I also looked at the previous four quarters: 2Q 2009, 3Q 2009, 4Q 2009 and 1Q 2010., 121446=UNIX vendors must make the ""mainframe argument"" that their flavor of UNIX is more resilient than any OS that runs on Intel or AMD x86 chipsets. In 2008, Sun Solaris was the number #1 UNIX, but today, it is IBM AIX with 40 percent marketshare. Meanwhile HP has focused on extending its Windows/x86 lead with a partnership with Microsoft., 198395=Continuing coverage of my week in Washington DC for the annual [2010 System Storage Technical University], I attended several XIV sessions throughout the week. There were many XIV sessions. I could not attend all of them. Jack Arnold, one of my colleagues at the IBM Tucson Executive Briefing Center, often presents XIV to clients and Business Partners. He covered all the basics of XIV architecture, configuration, and features like snapshots and migration. Carlos Lizarralde presented ""Solving VMware Challenges with XIV"". Ola Mayer presented ""XIV Active Data Migration and Disaster Recovery""., 290945=To learn more about IBM results 4Q09 and full-year 2009, see [Quarterly Earnings]., 311024=GPFS can support AIX, Linux, and Windows! Version 3.3 adds support for Windows 2008 Server on 64-bit chipset architectures from AMD and Intel. Now you can have a common GPFS cluster with AIX, Linux and Windows servers all sharing and accessing the same files. A GPFS cluster can have up to 256 file systems. Each of these file systems can be up to 1 billion files, up to 1PB of data, and can have up to 256 snapshots. GPFS can be used stand-alone, or integrated with a full IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) unified recovery management solution with parallel backup streams., 226684=technorati tags: IBM, SVC, 2145-CF8, SSD, FlashCopy, Metro+Mirror, Global+Mirror, EMC, VPLEX, CLARiiON, Symmetrix, VMAX, storage, virtualization, non-disruptive, HDS, USP-V, USP-VM, HP, SVSP,, 287807=Some analysts predict that by 2013, one out of five companies won't even have their own IT assets. IBM supports all flavors of private, public and hybrid cloud computing models. IBM has its own strong set of offerings, is also the number one reseller of VMware, and has cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon. HP and Microsoft have recently formed an alliance, but they have different takes on cloud computing. HP wants to be the ""infrastructure"" company, but Microsoft wants to focus on its [""three screens and a public cloud""] strategy. Microsoft has decided not to make its Azure Cloud operating system available for private cloud deployments. By contrast, IBM can start you with a private cloud, then help you transition to a hybrid cloud, and finally to a public cloud., 107074=The analyst mentioned EMC's failed product Invista, which sold less than 500 units over the past five years. The low penetration for external virtualization, estimated between 2-5 percent, could be explained from the bad taste that left in everyone considering their options. However, the analyst predicts that by 2015, external virtualization will reach double digit marketshare., 215611=Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions. IT storage can be expensive, so companies would like their new purchases to be fully utilized on day 1, and be completely empty on day 1500 when the lease expires. I have spoken to clients who have spent 6-9 months planning for the replacement or removal of a storage array., 141290=Mastering the art of stretching out a week-long event into two weeks' worth of blog posts, I continue my coverage of the [Data Center 2010 conference], Tuesday afternoon I attended several sessions that focused on technologies for Cloud Computing., 40403=Today, IBM announced [IBM PureSystems], a new family of expert-integrated systems that combine storage, servers, networking, and software, based on IBM's decades of experience in the IT industry. You can register for the [Launch Event] today (April 11) at 2pm EDT, and download the companion ""Integrated Expertise"" event app for Apple, Android or Blackberry smartphones.}","Fri, 29 May 2015 03:52:22 GMT","Before VPLEX, here is a breakdown of each solution: A solution to make the data migration non-disruptive would benefit the clients (make it easier for their IT staff to keep their data center modern and current) as well as the vendors (reduce the obstacle of selling and deploying new features and functions). Storage virtualization can be employed to help solve this problem. I define virtualization as ""technology that makes one set of resources look and feel like a different set of resources, preferably with more desirable characteristics."". By making different storage resources, old and new, look and feel like a single type of resource, migration can be performed without disrupting applications. Given that IT storage is typically replaced every 3-5 years, then pretty much every company with an internal IT department has this problem, the exception being those companies that don't last that long, and those that use public cloud solutions.
