They are usually friendly and helpful, and will even jump start your car if it needs a boost. The SCCCD police office is also located on campus. However, Fresno City is in the middle of a somewhat bad neighborhood, so while violence is often kept to a minimum, theft is forever rampant. I have been told many stories of stolen textbooks, Ipods, phones, computers, cars, etc. and have even had my hubcaps stolen, but there is a positive side. Most of the students are not bad people and believe in doing the right thing. I have also lost my laptop once and my phone three different times due to my own case of scatterbrain, and all three times have been lucky enough to have them returned to me by helpful people.', 'As I mentioned earlier, the variety of clubs on campus is astounding. there is a club rush at the beginning of each semester to introduce students and make them aware of what is happening at their campus. the teachers act as advisors, while the students usually take control of the sessions, which are scheduled all at different times throughout the week to allow for a variety of students to attend.', 'People who are looking for flexible class hours, like a laid-back environment, want to save money, and thrive in a diverse population will do very well at Fresno City College.', ""For the amount of money you spend, although it seems to increase every semester, you really are getting a lot for a little money. There are copy machines and computers available for use all the time. The staff is usually very willing to help with students' needs, and are often students at the college themselves."", ""There are many, many things to do at FCC. You are almost guaranteed never to be bored. For athletes, there is a long list of sports teams that, along with the more well-known sports, includes badminton and water polo.There are clubs on campus for a whole slew of hobbies, backgrounds, and cultural interests. They are usually mentored by the professors, run by the students, often have free food, and all meet at different times so you are sure to find one that fits into your schedule. the library has an amazing, broad assortment of books, magazines, and periodicals to satisfy one's inner nerd as well. Twice every semester, there are vendor fairs, similar to farmers' markets, and there is some neat stuff to be found at a bargain. Also, events are always happening in the free speech area, such as Native American Heritage day, Hispanic Heritage day, Protests, debates, etc. The campus frequently holds talent competitions for singing, dancing, and the like. Next to the cafeteria is a game room with air hockey and arcade games as well as a student lounge filled with couches and air conditioned for quiet comfort. It is host to many lectures and presentations throughout the semester."", ""There are multiple food options on campus. The cafeteria is chocked full of different types of pizza, salads, sandwiches, desserts, healthy snacks, and many drink choices at somewhat reasonable prices. There is a cart at the oppostie end of campus for students who cannot make it to the cafeteria before their next class. also, next to the bookstore is the Pacific Cafe, with many different choices of asian food, as well as choices like corn dogs and hamburgers, as well as a large variety or snack foods. In addition, many places on campus sell their own snacks to profit clubs. This is often the cheapest option. There is also Wendy's, KFC, Carl's Jr., and a Taco Bell, all easily within walking distance."", 'Although I really have little to compare to, Fresno City seems on par with, and sometimes superior to, the academic standards at Fresno State University. many of the teachers are careful to push their students, and not to let them slack off simply because they are at a pubic school. There is an honors program on campus that I am a member of, and the Honors classes are very challenging, without being too ridiculously difficult. They simply make you think, which is the goal of any quality education.', ""The best possible tips I can give are to come early and bring an inhaler. the parking lots at city are always full, and drivers begin to get cranky after a while, which nobody likes to deal with. So come early to claim your spot. don't worry though, it gets better once financial aid checks are distributed and students are dropped for excessive absences, etc. The smoking policy on campus is currently that it is okay to smoke as long as one is at least 20 feet from the entrance to any building, though there is no real enforcement. efforts are being made to change this relatively unhelpful regulation."", ""In three sentences, Fresno City College cannot be described, but it is worth attending if, like me, you need a quality education on a budget. The teachers that I have been able to work with, with one exception, all want the best for their students, and do not try and cheat you simply because you are a city college student and not attending some big university. The environment is not the classiest, but it's not meant to be a social hotspot, it's there to help your career.""]]",Fresno City College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Fresno-City-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/50549,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,35,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903308911,903242419,HORIZONTAL,,"03/09/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 4 out of 4 people found this review useful. 1 of 78 Paige from Fresno, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Hoping to take some of the financial slack off of my parents, I followed in my sister's footsteps and plan on doing the two years and Fresno City then transfer to a four year university.

I'm also a part of the women's soccer team at Fresno City, so I'm familiar with other students who are invovled in athletics and those in the honors program.

It's alternate route to take for a decent education without having to pay thousands of dollars for a four year institute. Money has become the attention grabber and it doesn't seem to be getting much better. Hoping to take some of the financial slack off of my parents, I followed in my sister's footsteps and plan on doing the two years and Fresno City then transfer to a four year university. Basically my parents will be paying for 2 students for the price of one student going straight to a university for the four years. Am enjoying being here I'm not going to lie, but Fresno City was the least place I wanted to be. However, I have became accutomed to it and have a mindset to stay focus. I'm also a part of the women's soccer team at Fresno City, so I'm familiar with other students who are invovled in athletics and those in the honors program.

This range of opportunities I think is great for all the different types of students and their situations."", ""Unfortunately I haven't spent enough time on campus during peak hours to notice much in areas of traditions. However, through the opportunity of an extra credit assignment I was exposed to a little learning/reading museum on Campus. It is dedicated to Gary Soto a poet and author who is native to Fresno and alumni to Fresno City College. I don't remember if it is the only one in the state or the nation but his museum is the only one named after/dedicated to a living writer.

Just make sure the street allows parking. See a counselor often and sit in the front row of your classes., 69444=Study and really put the effort into your courses. It is school, after all. If necessary, have a weekly schedule to manage your time wisely and have an agenda to keep track of deadlines and important dates. Look into Transfer Day during the month of September. Use Assist.ORG and Ratemyprofessor.com to make the best out of your semester. Accept every chance that is offered for PRIORITY registration. You will have the best selection of classes and schedules. Classes fill up fast so this is your chance. If you really want to save money on books, use CRAIGSLIST.ORG and search in the Books category. Most of the time, you find the book(s) for your class. No waiting needed and you can resell them instead of just returning them when you rent them. So use Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist!}",

They are always aware of what is happening in the dorms and are available at whatever time you need them, whether it is during super early or super late. They are basically considered a support system in bad times and authority as well and they do anything for us to have an awesome year in our dorms.

As most freshmen will do, go to the frats to party for the first few months (if you're into that sort of thing). But after a while, most people outgrow frat parties and recognize that house parties are where its at."", 'Philosophy students, nursing students, engineers, international relations.', ""There are a bunch of good museums to go to (personally the Andy Warhol is my favorite). There are plenty of exercise facilities on campus. There are also a plethora of good restaurants in Oakland. I'd recommend Joe Mama's (good Italian food). As for movies, South Side Works Cinema is just a few bus stops away, and it has student discounts (tickets are unbelievably cheap on weeknights.)"", ""OK. When it comes to meal plans, don't make the mistake that the majority of freshmen make. Many people get the unlimited meal plans. I advise against this. This is way more food than you can eat, trust me. I originally had this meal plan, but I realized that it is really a rip off. There are two ways of paying for food on campus: dining passes (swipes) and dining dollars. Dining passes get you into Market Central or The Perch (these are the two main dining facilities). One swipe gets you all you can eat of a variety of foods: Pizza, sandwiches, soups, stir fry, salads, pasta, burgers, fries, grilled cheese, ethnic foods, etc. Now, these all you can eat buffets will be like a dream come true at first, but after three weeks or so.. you will become unbelievably tired of this food. Which is why I encourage you to go with the second option instead. Dining dollars are much more flexible than dining passes. Dining dollars can be used at the variety of other places to eat on campus: Taco Bell, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Pizza Hut, Einstien Bros. Bagels, Schenley Cafe (this has a bunch of good stuff.. even Sushi!) and Quik-Zone (this is a university operated convenience store type thing..it has things to microwave in your room, sandwiches, F'real milkshakes, sodas, candy, etc.) Dining dollars are way more enticing, but they can slip away from you. I would recommend figuring out how many dining dollars you want to spend per week and abide by that allowance."", ""Dorm life is one of Pitt's weaker points. While its not awful, dorm life certainly isn't as good as you would probably find at a smaller private university. First of all, it is very unlikely that you will get the housing you prefer. The university uses a lottery system to dole out the available dorms and apartments, and you rarely get what you want. Living in Towers is decent, because this is where most freshmen live (you will meet a sh*t ton of good people here). Sutherland is where the honors college dorms are (probably a little bit nicer than towers, but you are kind of isolated from everything on lower campus)."", ""I'm a Political Science & Philosophy major, so (apart from Psychology) I really can't speak as to the vigor of the natural science courses. However, their humanities courses are no more challenging than an average high school AP course. Overall, Pitt has a decent reputation; but it has a few departments and programs which stand out: Pitt has a phenomenal philosophy department - it has been ranked in the top 5 departments by several sources. Pitt also has good medical programs, especially nursing and physical therapy."", ""A couple of things about Pitt: Get your Application and FAFSA and everything done as soon as you can. Pitt offers merit scholarships, but they are quite limited in number. I didn't apply until right before the deadline, so most of the scholarship money was GONZO by the time my app went in. If your school offers AP courses or something like college in high school, absolutely take advantage of it. My high school had a Dual Enrollment agreement with a local college where college credits were earned for getting A's in classes with college equivalents. Pitt accepted ALL of my credits (40+)."", ""I've recently completed my first semester here at Pitt, and there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that I am at the right school.

There is a dining hall in towers and also Sutherland that offers different items cooked daily. The dining dollars are for places such as Taco Bell, Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut, a smoothie place, salads, sushi, yogurt, and more. I have not yet gotten tired of the food because there are SO many choices. The dorm rooms are, well, dorm rooms. I love my roommate- they do a great job of pairing you with someone who they think you will be interested in getting to know.

There are so many clubs and organizations always looking for people to get involved, not only will it look good on resumes, but I have met so many friends with similar interests this way.

The teaching assistants are students that have previously taken the class and are there for help. They may teach recitations or schedule one-one-ones.

Though it's good the first few weeks you get to campus, the food soon gets old. There is some variety in what is offered there, as long as you go at the right time. Towards the end of the day, they begin to run out of things. I personally would like Market to serve breakfast food longer throughout the week. Other than Market, there are bunch of food courts that you can dine in on campus. These are all awesome and offer a wide variety of food. Some of these places are known restaurants, including Einstein's Bagels and Chick-fil-A. These places were personally my favorite. The QuickZone also offered a wide variety of food that you could purchase to eat then, or bring back to your dorm for later. I bought food and would bring it back to my dorm. That way if I just wanted to eat in for a meal, I always had something I could make. Lastly, Pitt features Market-to-go.

There weren't the typical dorm distractions. We all understood the amount of work we had to do and respected each other. If you ever had questions about anything, there was always someone else working on the same assignment or project. It was a great way to meet people with similar interests and get to know people outside of classes. Our residence assistants were also fabulous. They were all upperclassmen engineers. They were fun, yet proved to be great role models for the residents in my building. The dorms were always clean, thanks to the housekeeping staff. And the number one thing - I always felt safe."", ""I am currently an engineering major at Pitt. My classes were extremely challenging my freshman year - more so than I expected. I actually had to learn how to study and what worked best for me. Even my electives, which were supposedly blow off classes were challenging. I have never had to put so much hard work into classes. You learn that you need to understand things on a much deeper basis than just a surface level understanding. Surface level understanding at Pitt will get you nowhere. It takes a lot of discipline to do practice problems for homework when you don't have to turn any in. You really are held accountable for learning on your own also. Professors are there to give an overview, the rest is up to you and how you use your resources (books, TA's, professors etc.). All and all, it's challenging, yet rewarding."", ""There are a few things that can be potentially intimidating about Pitt's campus. This includes that fact that it's an urban campus, and the hills. No need to worry about either. I feel extremely safe on campus despite the urban culture. The hills - you get used to walking to class. One last thing - you WILL end up with swipes for Market Central leftover at the end of the year. Most students eat there once every two days, or so. Dining dollars are a lot more convenient and useful so you should get as many as you can."", ""The University of Pittsburgh is fabulous.

These dining dollars can be spent at local on-campus eateries such as Einstein Brothers, Sub Connection, and the coffee carts, which offer options you will likely tire less of then the dining hall called Market Central. The dining hall is not amazing, but it does offer a lot of options such as stir-fry, hamburgers, pasta and a sub bar.', 'If you get stuck in the older dorms, such as Holland or Brackenridge, be warned that there is no air conditioner.

Usually, Pitt will waive the application fee if you take the tour of the campus with the Pitt Pathfinders and you can apply directly after you finish your tour. Also, tour the campus on your own and make sure you can handle the hills of Oakland. Do not be turned off by South Oakland either, there are nicer places for you to live when you move off-campus.', ""Pitt is a great school for people who are unsure of the path they wish to take, but know they want to continue their education.

At the beginning of every school year they host a Student Activities Fair where students can walk around and talk to representatives from almost every club at Pitt and see which ones they'd be interested in joining. There are well over 200 clubs at Pitt and in all different areas from sports to academic to religious."", 'Pitt is great for students who like to get really involved in their campus community and have a lot of school spirit. It is also great for people who want to be really involved in academics because there are a lot of opportunities for research and scholarships if you look for them.', ""For someone who is looking at Pitt's price tag it may seem a little expensive for a public school which may be true. However Pitt does make up for this by offering their students a lot of services at no additional cost including busing around the city, health services, a huge career placement department, and lots of gym facilities. It is wise to take advantage of every perk and service Pitt offers before you graduate to get the most bang for your buck."", 'Pittsburgh is a really artistic city. There are always symphonies performing, plays, musicals, ballets, and art exhibits. A lot of these shows are discounted for college students and many museums are free for college students. Also, Pitt has a program called PittArts where you can sign up to go on arts field trips to see a performance or art exhibit and get lunch or dinner, all for free.', ""The food options at Pitt are plenty. The main dining hall is almost always open with a bunch of different dining options. If you don't have time to sit down, there are countless to go places within a five minute walk of almost every academic building. If you don't want to buy campus food, there are still plenty of chain restaurants up and down Forbes Avenue and many of them have deals and discounts on certain days of the week."", 'The residence halls at Pitt are fun. There are always activities and programs going on in the buildings. The Resident Assistants are well trained and super friendly and always there to help the residents. In addition there are two specific clubs for resident students, Resident Student Association and National Residence Hall Honorary, that make students feel at home by putting on programs and setting up community service projects.', ""Pitt has a reputation for demanding academics. Classes are something to take very seriously because they can be tough. If you put in the work you get out the good grades, if you don't put in the work it will be obvious when you take that first exam. There is almost no class at Pitt where you don't have to work at least moderately hard. When it comes to academic advising it is best that students take the advisor's advice with a grain of salt. Sometimes advisers will try to get students to take on extra certificates or minors, while done in good intention this isn't always what you need so be sure to know exactly what you want before you go for advising."", ""The University of Pittsburgh is a busy place, there is a lot to do on campus and there is hardly ever a dull moment.

There are over 400. See below. -Pitt Program Council events. PPC is the event planning club at Pitt, and they get about 200k/year to play around with. In my freshman year, they brought in Hoodie Allen, Kenan Thompson, American Authors (with a free food truck festival), and Lupe Fiasco. They also do lots of other events throughout the year like spa days, open mic nights, trips to theme parks and pro sports games, paintball, and cupcake/cookie decorating. Other big clubs also bring people in, like the Rainbow Alliance brought in Laverne Cox.

There are also a couple cool clubs and bars around the city that students frequent."", ""Again, since I didn't live on campus I can't say much about the cafeteria. I personally didn't really like it, but I know it is a lot better and has way much more variety than most. The meal plans try to scam every freshman, so get the lowest one you can. The great thing about living in the city is that there are so many other options besides cafeteria food. Just don't tie up all your money in Dining Dollars and Swipes, and you'll be able to take advantage of that."", ""I never lived in a dorm. For the fact that they allow freshmen to live off-campus in the first place, when many schools don't, I'll rate them a 5/5. Besides that, I never met anybody who had any real problems with their dorms. Most people say it's super easy to make friends in dorms. They're tiny as hell, but that's kind of the idea if you live in the dorm. Still, I would strongly encourage everyone to look into off-campus housing. You will save a lot of money, and the Commuter Student Association is great at Pitt. They sponsor lots of free events for you to get to know other commuters, and I met a lot of my good friends there."", ""Rigor can be mixed bag with Pitt. Bio and Chem courses are notoriously hard, and cause lots of pre-med kids to switch majors (free tutoring is available, but if you're not totally in love with science you'll probably just give up). Other than that, you shouldn't be screaming your head off to get good grades, but you will be challenged."", ""-Since Pitt has endless things to do, it will be easy to overestimate your time and overbook yourself. Looking through the list and going to the activities fair, you will want to do everything. Commit to one or two clubs you really care about, and visit the rest whenever they have big events open to everyone. -Be open to meeting people different than what you're used to. Pitt isn't the most diverse school percentage-wise, but since it has over 15000 kids, it still adds up. -Take advantage of O-Week! Lots of schools don't offer anything like it, and it's a super easy way to learn about the school, make friends, and get a ton of free stuff, so go to as many events as you can. -Don't spend the next ~100 days wasting away in Oakland. Pittsburgh is a city known for it's diverse neighborhoods and the bus is free with your Pitt ID, so you should do something in all of them at least once (cultural district, south side, shadyside, squirrel hill, lawrenceville, east liberty, waterfront, north shore). -Take advantage of the internship/volunteering opportunities of living in a big city. Leadership in Action is a program that gives you experience working on a special project for a local nonprofit. First Experiences in Research is also a great program, and not just for STEM majors. They have projects for everything from bio to psych to history to art. -PITT ARTS!!! Their events are everything. They take you to a play or musical in the city plus get you dinner at a restaurant, for free. Sign up for their newsletters to get notified so you can sign up. -Watch your spending. Living in a city, it's easy to lose track of money you spend on random crap. My club's blog, pittpennysavers.blogspot.com , writes articles about how to save on Pitt's campus. -Study abroad. You can go almost anywhere! Obviously this is a bit down the line for freshman, but you can start looking into it today. They have a good website that details all the programs. There are lots of scholarships that can make it possible for almost anybody."", 'Pitt literally has something for everyone. There are majors/minors/certificates in nearly anything you could think of, over 400 clubs, and Pittsburgh is a city that offers a wide variety of living arrangements, tons of restaurants, and entertainment/fun events every weekend.

Pitt's football games always have great attendance by students. SO COME JOIN IN ON THE FUN!"", ""I have to say that from my experiences taking classes at Pitt, the professors are excellent. They were truly helpful with any questions or concerns I had. Whenever I had questions about the content I was studying at the time I had so many avenues where I could find help. I could go to the Academic Resource Center for tutoring, group study sessions performed by TA's during the week, e-mailing professors or teacher's assistants for explanation, and if all that didn't work I could always go to speak with my professor during their required office hours. I have found that alot of proffesors may be intimidating in a lecture hall but when you speak to them one on one, it's completely different, they are actually human beings!!!""]]",University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,48,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903560815,903375534,HORIZONTAL,,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 44 out of 49 people found this review useful. 1 of 214 Lauren from Harrison City, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The majority of classes will be very large lecture halls that don't allow for much student/teacher communication. You simply have to be ready to focus on the fact that you are there to learn and to set a solid foundation for your future."", ""The most important thing is to pay attention in lecture. It's completely different from high school, with most teachers only providing a few examples, expecting you to learn most concepts on your own. The faster you realize that you need to look over you notes on a regular basis, the better off you will be. Also, if you see that you're distracted in lecture by a friend of yours, explain the situation to them and sit somewhere else. This was one of my biggest realizations, because if you sit with a big group, you'll quickly stop paying attention in lecture and you will fall behind. Lastly, although study groups are a good way to clarify specific problems, individual study will make up most of your studying, because figuring something out for yourself is the best way to truly learn it and understand it."", 'Pitt is definitely one of the more expensive public universities, but the quality of education makes up for it. Specifically for the engineering program, most students participate in a co-op program. The program consists of a work/study cycle in which the job openings are secured through the engineering school. This program provides highly valuable work experience, increasing chances that graduates will be hired as soon as the finish college. This co-op program is what really sold me on picking Pitt, because it gets you involved with big name companies, and exposes you to the job environment you can expect to be in when you finish schooling.', 'Although the campus appears to be hectic and somewhat intimidating, you quickly realize that the majority of others are in the same situation you are, trying to juggle school and friends. My favorite part of the campus is the high energy environment, which really keeps you awake and busy. There is also plenty to do, depending on what you enjoy. You can visit the Carnegie museums, go to Southside to grab a bite, or catch a laser light show at the Science Center (this is my personal favorite). Because your Pitt ID doubles as a bus pass, you can reach any of these destinations in a few minutes, at no cost to you.', 'Although most of my impressions are from the engineering department, the depth and quality of my 2 music electives lead me to believe that the university is top notch in all departments. Specifically, the engineering program will not only teach you general math/science/computer concepts, but it will also force you to learn how to handle multiple projects, tests, and how to maintain a reasonable social life. You will quickly learn what time management/study methods work best for you, which will most certainly help you in your post-college life.']]",University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,49,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903560815,903375534,HORIZONTAL,,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 44 out of 49 people found this review useful. 1 of 214 Lauren from Harrison City, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Also, visit the campus, because it really is true that the feeling of the college campus is correlated to the amount of happiness you experience once you enroll.', 'Pitt is not the most affordable college in the world. Most financial aid comes from Federal and State assistance rather than from the institution itself. This is because Pitt is a public institution and unfortunately the state of Pennsylvania does not have the plethora funding for higher education that some states possess. However, the education and research opportunities are excellent and Pitt is definitely a good undergraduate choice before attending graduate school.', ""There is so much to do in Pittsburgh and so much to see whether you're looking for cuisine, museums, culture, or social interactions. We have professional baseball, football, and hockey teams in Pittsburgh so all sorts of sports fans can feel at home. The museums are large and within walking distance and since Pitt provides free transportation on the local Port Authority bus system, you can travel anywhere in the city at no cost. Great food is everywhere and there are famous eateries right on campus including Primanti Brothers and Quaker Steak and Lube (both featured on Man v. Food on the Travel Channel). Pitt also sponsors a constant array of entertainment including sponsoring trips around the city and bringing in therapy dogs for students to pet and love on once a week. The campus is also beautiful and surprising open for a city campus. In the early fall and spring there are enough open places for one to relax and enjoy the weather both on campus and within walking distance and there is a beautiful park less than a mile away where one can enjoy surprisingly quiet and peaceful wildlife on beautiful trials right in the middle of a city. If you're more of an indoor person, residence halls are lovely and Pitt also offers a single dorm option (even for freshmen) for those who are less social and are not yet ready to have a roommate. With free Internet and cable and a two large libraries located on lower campus, an indoor person can enjoy both video-games or a good book. The only downside of the city is that in the late fall and winter, Pitt experiences a fair share of rainy, dreary, and bitterly cold days, However, it gives you a better chance to get to know your roommates and floor mates!"", ""Class at Pitt can seem daunting when coming from a small high school due to the mere size of the Gen. Ed. classes. However, the longer you're here, the smaller the classes get. Good news is the larger classes are larger because you're unlikely to need a lot of individual attention because they're far easier and a lot less work than your smaller classes (but none the less informative). The professors I've had thus far have been entertaining and very willing to help out any student, and I've yet to experience any unfair grading or extremely difficult exams. Overall, I'm very happy with my education thus far and look forward to my next semester at Pitt!""]]",University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,59,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903560815,903375534,HORIZONTAL,,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 44 out of 49 people found this review useful. 1 of 214 Lauren from Harrison City, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

(Since I live off campus I don't have a meal plan). There are many restaurants (especially pizza places!) and a grocery store on Forbes for food. Rite aid also sells food, and you can take a bus to Giant Eagle, there's also some restaurants that deliver to the dorms as well."", ""From what I've heard, dorm life is great and everyone loves it. Move in day is a little overwhelming, as theres so many people trying to move in. They are building another dorm though! The dorm directors also plan activities sometimes too. I live off campus in an apartment though, and I've had a great experience with that (and cheaper than a dorm as well)."", ""This depends on many things: teacher, class level ( undergrad, grad, honors), the class itself (biology is going to be harder than say performance), course of study and how interested you are in the class. Overall, I'd say Pitt (since it's a big research and medical school) is a 3.5-4/ 5 for academic rigor, because it's definitely harder than state schools and community colleges... not everyone that applies gets in and it doesn't get as much state funding as state schools."", ""Get involved and out of your comfort zone. Take a performance class, join a club or class that sounds interesting, study abroad, intern or do research to build your resume--- there's so many choices and you'll only grow from the ones you make!"", ""This school is a superb one to go to-- whether it be the great neighborhood, enriching atmosphere, decent price and wide variety of academic opportunities. It is a 5 minute bus ride from the city itself, so you get both the city and a suburban feel. There is a sense of a close community that I didn't feel from other schools I visited (either when looking at schools or visiting friends).""]]",University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,75,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903560815,903375534,HORIZONTAL,,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 44 out of 49 people found this review useful. 1 of 214 Lauren from Harrison City, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

If you can get an education for cheaper at a school with as much merit as Pitt, definitely consider your options from the financial point of view."", 'Rather than going to parties every weekend, I was glad that Oakland was close to everything! Catching a movie in Downtown Pittsburgh, eating at the Cheesecake Factory in the South Side, buying groceries at Giant Eagle in the the Water Front, hanging out in Station Square, or just walking around Oakland with a group of friends to check out the surrounding areas such as Soldiers and Sailors Memorial, Phipps Observatory, or even scaling the Cathedral of Learning and exploring the Nationality Rooms--there is so much to do! Whether you feel like catching the bus to the mall and shopping alone or with a friend, you will always have something to do. By the way, you ride the bus for free with you Pitt ID card. Why not explore?', ""I can't complain about the restaurant selection on-campus. I love Chipotle and Subway and any place where they serve pizza or even sushi. However I wasn't too fond of the cafeteria food. There was a big selection, but the quality of the food was not so great to me. Having a lot of flex money or 'Dining Dollars' was important to me because then I could buy all the sushi, milk, name-brand cereal and snacks that I wanted and just keep them in my room. The stuff was a little expensive but hey, the meal plan was already paid for, might as well use it up."", ""Don't get too overwhelmed about adjusting to the college atmosphere; the dorms are set up so that you can easily make friends and also have your privacy. Getting a single room may not be a bad idea because you get to enjoy both! However, having a roommate can be a good experience too; they could very well become your best friend. Living in the dorms at Pitt was an OK experience for me. My Residence Assistant or RA was very nice every year but she was no pushover when it came to rule enforcement, which I thought was great due to those weekday party-ers. It's hard to sleep, let alone study when the person next door is screaming and blasting music on a Tuesday night; the walls seem paper-thin! There are also other rules that must be followed regarding guests and quiet hours; these aren't too bad. My only complaint would be the size of the sink in my room; it might as well have been a hose. I couldn't keep the floor dry because it just sprayed everywhere and the sink was extremely small and shallow which made brushing teeth a challenge. The water pressure was pretty high. Talk about a bullet shower...."", ""It's not as bad as it sounds, but college is not like high school. You don't have the same classes every day (unless that is the set up or you choose do so), teachers and parents aren't breathing down your neck about homework and attendance, and more than likely you won't feel the same structure as you did before. You have a lot more freedom! But with that, you also have more responsibilities. That doesn't mean you have to spend every waking moment with your face in a textbook or push yourself over the edge. Don't stress, just prioritize and manage you time wisely to relieve some of that workload. Of course schoolwork should come first, then the fun. Make time for both--that way you won't feel isolated or stressed out, especially when that deadline or due date approaches! Another useful tip is to take the time to get to know your professors. Go to their office hours and don't be afraid to ask questions. Sometimes they will cut you some slack!"", 'Pitt is pretty expensive. Take advantage of any scholarship opportunities you get and be sure to keep your grades up--good grades leads to even more opportunities for networking and racking up those dollars. The Outside of the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) program is also a great thing to be a part of; every Pitt student can do it! By keeping up with the activities sponsored by OCC, I have made a lot of friends, learned more about music and other cultures, and most importantly had a lot of fun!', 'The University of Pittsburgh is a great place to study! Although Oakland is super-urban, extremely crowed and often times quite noisy, the city has many beautiful sites; you will immediately feel welcomed and at home here.

Otherwise, they were a major disruption to the learning environment and so I'd have to say they would be very detrimental here, but I think they were a one time thing. Without that, the campus is very very safe. I've never ever felt threatened in the slightest or worried for my safety, even walking across campus all alone at 10 pm felt safe to me."", ""Not very active compared to other schools, but you can definitely find a way to enjoy it and get involved if you're into that sort of thing."", 'There are plenty of activities to be involved and engaged in. Our ultimate frisbee team just won the national championship, and our fencing team is also very competitive. I personally love snowboarding so I joined the Ski and Snowboard club which allows me to engage in my hobby for a discounted rate with other like minded students in close proximity to the school and far away.', 'Love sports, interested in pre med or engineering, love Pittsburgh', 'The Cathedral is definitely something everyone knows about and should check out, but lesser wonders are the Schenley Memorial Fountain and then further out the Phipps Conservatory and Schenley Park.', ""Definitely more affordable than some other big state schools, especially if you're in state. A great quality education and all around enjoyable experience, at a much lower premium than comparable schools."", ""See Pittsburgh! Visit Squirrel Hill and Southside regularly, ride the incline train, tour downtown Pittsburgh! All that transportation is free, so you should definitely take advantage of it. There are also plenty of school sponsored events going on all the time, so be in the know on PPC and you'll be constantly engaged."", ""Some have their qualms about Market Central, but I'd have to say we have it WAY better than most other schools. All you can eat buffet with several different restaurants, a la carte, self serve, and dessert? I don't see much to complain about. The food quality definitely decreases over the course of the year and even over the course of each day, but it never gets bad, just not as good. As far as off campus dining is concerned, there is so much diverse food in Oakland you'll never get bored. Enjoy Chipotle every day like some people I know or try something different every day; you'll be satisfied either way."", ""Usually quite fantastic, but it depends on which residence you live in. As a freshman, you'll definitely want to live in (by order of preference) Tower B, Sutherland or Tower A. They are really the social hubs on campus and will guarantee both proximity to resources and your highest exposure to a diverse student body."", ""I'd say most classes aren't very difficult, but there's definitely a high variance there. Introductory and intermediate science classes with large class sizes tend to be rather difficult, as they aim to filter the mass of students enrolled, but small classes are comically easy in that they usually require almost no effort to achieve an A. This isn't particularly bad, because everyone needs a break, but you need to make sure you're actually learning, so don't be afraid to challenge yourself and test the waters with some more advanced, major specific courses."", ""Try to be as friendly as you can with the people you meet and you'll definitely enjoy your time here. The coursework isn't too challenging, but you still need to make sure you don't slack off and focus when necessary. Really all you need to do to have a great, valuable experience is to be open to new experiences."", ""I love the University of Pittsburgh for it's engaging academic and extracurricular environment. The neighborhood of Oakland and surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods never cease to entertain me; I always have something to do. Academic resources fall short for some majors though, like computer science, but that is changing quickly as the demand for these lesser majors increases.""]]",University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh-Campus/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,106,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903560815,903375534,HORIZONTAL,,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 44 out of 49 people found this review useful. 1 of 214 Lauren from Harrison City, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There are safety stations every couple hundred feet, where all you do is press the button and a campus cop will be there within seconds. There was also never an interval greater than 5 minutes where you would not see a police officer driving on the street. The university is all students and for such a big city I felt incredibly safe on campus.', 'This is easily the best university to go to in Pennsylvania. There is so much to do in the city, on top of being a very prestigious school with great academics for half the price of a private school.', 'This is one of the biggest reasons I chose the University of Pittsburgh. There is so much to do in Pittsburgh that you will never be bored. Students gain entrance to 3 different museums for free. We get student rush tickets to Penguins games for 25$ where you could end up sitting in glass seats. Pirates games are only 10$ and you get a free t-shirt. Season tickets for football are only 20$. Throughout the year there are many ballets and plays being performed that are free to students. Schenley park is right across the campus with plenty of biking trails, a tennis court, and an outdoor ice skating rink. South Side is also just a short bus ride away which offers a great shopping experience. And with free transportation with your student I.D., there is no reason not to do all of these things.', ""On campus there are plenty of places to eat. There are two eateries, the Perch and Market Central, that you can use dining dollars, cash, or meal passes at. There are also plenty of other small food/coffee carts around campus. As well as a multitude of restaurants on Forbes Avenue such as The Original Hot Dog Shop, Primanti Brothers, Quaker Steak, Pamela's Diner, Subway, and Joe Mama's. The selection of options for dining is very wide and you will never get tired of eating the same thing with so many options to choose from."", ""Living on campus is great. From the towers or the Schenley Quad almost every class you're going to have is a very short walk. The rooms are much bigger than most other college dorm rooms that I've seen. Most have air conditioning and all have heat in the winter time. The freshman dorms also are right in the middle of the campus which is great. If you are more into studying you can join the Living Learning communities which are specially for students in certain majors and rules there are more geared towards helping you study. Each room contains beds that can be transformed in bunk beds, large desks, dressers, closet space, and carpeting. There are also small gyms in almost every dorm hall which is great for those who exercise a lot."", ""The University of Pittsburgh is one of the top public schools in the nation. Curriculum's are at the level you need them to be at. You are also able to pick your own schedule freshman year which is amazing. The science/medical program is also one of the best in the country. UPMC is just a block away from the campus, which has great opportunities for research and shadowing doctors and nurses. The success rate for students getting into medical schools from the university is above 70% which is excellent."", 'Definitely study, study, study.

College is about challenging yourself so these teachers are just what you need. Some of those I feared ended up being some of my best teachers. Also, don't be afraid to try something you never have before class-wise. I took Japanese though I had no prior knowledge and it was a wonderful experience. Stepping outside of your box is never a bad thing. Last but not least, always keep on eye on your E-bills (payment system for school). Every semester there seemed to be a problem with mine where payments would disappear and things would not add up. It isn't unusual when you have to keep track of thousands of students. Just call financial aid and the according offices and they will gladly work with you. But always check just in case because there is nothing worse than looking at something telling you that you owe more than you do.

I didn't even live on campus this year and the Pitt police do an amazing job and I have never seen any racial bias and I hangout with a very diverse group of people. Pitt students peacefully protest something about once a year and the cops are always there to watch but never interfere. As a personal anecdote I had a house fire off campus in South Oakland (where most off campus students live) and Pitt gave me money, temporary housing and clothes from the athletic department. There are also emergency phones all over campus that are used for calling police at any time. They have big blue lights so that you can't ever miss them. They are also in alley ways so that you don't ever feel isolated and unsafe."", 'Greek life in Pittsburgh is minimal ( about eight percent of students) and has very negative associations. Greek life is also expensive and the stereotyped are basically caricatures on campus. Coming from a working class town like Pittsburgh and a working class family the sense of entitlement that is associated with frats is typically frowned upon. Besides there are much better ways to make friends at Pitt rather than pay for them. All of the clubs are very open minded.', 'If you are bored on campus its your fault. I joined the Brazilian club and I am not Brazilian at all. I learned how to do many different Brazilian dances and many different things about the culture. I joined rugby and met a group of guys that is always doing something and built friendships I will likely never forget.', 'A student who is ready to work and deal with a lot of open professors. All the professors are very blunt but are willing to work with undergrads for research. This is often instrumental in any field of study.', ""The Cathedral of Learning is our staple of pride. It was being built during and shortly after the great depression so there wasn't very much money. The first three floors are dedicated to the community as Pitt reached out and told different ethnic groups that if they donated money that a room would be dedication to their heritage. The experience of being in one of these rooms is amazing. You truly feel like you are part of history by walking in. All of them are truly works of craftsmanship. A tradition that I can't take place in is Lantern Night. Truly something special for the girls on campus. It is behind the Cathedral of Learning and all the freshman females on campus are invited to light a lantern and let it float into the sky. If your mother went to Pitt she holds the lantern while you light it. Truly touching."", 'I would say that you get exactly what you pay for at Pitt and you design your experience here more than anyone else.', ""In Oakland there is a lot of good and ethnic cheap food so eating out is also an option any time really. If you have the money to eat off campus, do so. There are plenty of concert halls and theaters in the city, some owned by the university. There are lots of places that are free to Pitt students such as the Fipps Conservatory and Carnegie Museum of Art and Natural History. We also get free bus fare with the IDs so we can travel all over the metropolitan area. Mt. Washington is perfect for a date with a significant other as it has view of one of the most beautiful skylines in the country and many high end restaurants. Of course there is the bar scene for older prospects, go to south side and you'll be surprised how many bars are known for their good food and friendly atmosphere."", 'The food here is okay. If you like chicken patties, pizza and burgers this is the place! They serve them every day which can be bland. But there are also vegetarian and vegan options.', ""Dorm life on main campus varies but all of it is well kept. There are places on campus that offer only singles so you don't have to have a roommate (Lothrop Hall). Freshman who decide to live on campus have to live in either Tower A, B or C. These towers are a place of history. Every person I know says how much they either loved them or hated them. Regardless of how much they liked it they always had a great story to tell."", ""I feel that most of the academic rigor comes from the extremely intelligent professors. Some of them admittedly can't teach but have to as it is part of the requirements that they have if they want to research here.

The RA's really try to foster a bond among students. Sometimes it can get noisy and difficult to be around friends all the time, especially when trying to study. It's definitely an adjustment, but there are plenty of places to study, like the study rooms at the end of every hall, the lounges on every floor, or the library a two-minute walk away."", ""Webster is challenging but the professors present these challenges well so I want to take them on. Finals aren't necessarily tests but projects, presentations, or speech so we have to take what we learn in the class and actually use it, instead of cramming for an exam and throwing our knowledge away."", ""Make sure to get to know your professors because they will be invaluable resources when trying to find jobs or if you just need advice. Take advantage of the fact you're in a small school. Get involved so you can find your passion and what you want to do with the rest of your life. If you can, live on campus because it helps you focus more on school and become more involved. Don't miss classes even though you're in college. Webster is small and the professor will notice and wonder why you're not in class. Just remember, though, it's only because they care. Also, get a work study job because If ever I need someone to talk to, I have dozens of professors and peers who care about me in my work study. Without a doubt Webster has the best professors and the best students."", ""I've never comfortable in school settings until I started at Webster. The professors are the most supportive teachers I've ever met. Attending Webster makes me feel like I'm a part of this bigger family away from home. When I started my works-study at the English and Philosophy department, which is in an old mansion, I instantly became a member of their community.""]]",Webster University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Webster-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/10879,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,17,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00338-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903622255,903560957,HORIZONTAL,,"08/23/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 5 out of 7 people found this review useful. 1 of 70 Kevin from St Louis, MO Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Differences may arise from returns, bad product, or other sales concessions.', 'Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes.

It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size.

This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management.

Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages.

Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business.

It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.
