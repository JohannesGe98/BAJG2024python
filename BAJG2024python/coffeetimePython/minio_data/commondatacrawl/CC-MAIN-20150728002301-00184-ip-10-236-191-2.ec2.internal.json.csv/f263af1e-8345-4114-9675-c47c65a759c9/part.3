If you are interested in concerts there are always many that are put on by the universities Friday night fever group who also on occasion host events with laser tag, blow up obstacle courses, and international nights. For just about ever interest there is also a club; multicultural, lgbt groups, shoot gun club, Swing dance club (where you can actually learn how to do it, guys take that down because being able to dance like that with a girl is a huge turn on for most women) Also if you are interested in personal health all full time students have access to the Half Acre gym currently getting a new renovation, and trust me it is going to be awesome ( I work there) To be honest an amazing way to get involved is greek life dont knock it till you at least try out an event and remember ever house is different every where you go and if you actually give it a chance there is a place for everyone there and there are not all just parties they are so much more. Out side of the university for those of you who are more adventurous and love the outdoors Laramie offers a lot of free camping locations, rock climbing, hiking, and free hot springs near by. Also in town if you are home sick for your pets you can volunteer to walk animals at the local animal shelter. Or if you need to get some stress out go stop by the local batting cages or bowling ally where the prices are low and you can play billiards while you wait. Also don't forget Laramie offers cheap movies where students get a discount and Tuesdays are half price and if you are into even smaller venues there is the wyo theater that has one showing every night for three dollars, its a great date night. Dont even get me started on the summer....."", 'The largest dinning hall is Washaki the food is pretty good and there is a ton of variety and always a late night snack special. The student union also houses a convenience store, panda express, a pizza place, ice cream shop, pita pit, garden cafe where you can get drinks if you are old enough, and a coffee shop. Additional there are two other cafe/dinning halls on campus spread out so that you can always get a snack or some caffeine to keep you going in class.', 'The dorms are great, very safe. The key to making your experience there the best you can is to get out and be social from the very beginning. When I first arrived two guys on our floor where having birthdays the first weekend so we made cupcakes for everyone and made sure to say hello to everyone. From then on out anytime we were hanging out in the floors lounge or fishbowl as it is called here people would come in and join us making our floor more of a family than a group of people stuck together.', 'The classes here are college classes, you will have to study especially for the classes within your major. Trust me I was one of those high school students that did not really have to study to graduate in the top 10. The general education classes can help you open your eyes to things going on in the world that you did not know about before if you let them. Take classes for fun if you are taking a hard semester it will give you something to look forward to studying or to give you a bit of a break.', 'Just go. Getting in the door is the first step to figuring out what you want to do. Take as many of the general education classes as you can from the start and figure out what you are interested in. Get to know people on campus, they are extremely friendly and if you find a friend that is in your major it can help a lot when it comes to studying. Greek life in Wyoming is a very small community but can be very beneficial academically more so than some people think, especially when it comes to the professor dinners and getting to know your professors personally.', 'Is a surprisingly diverse university of its location due to its focus on international studies. It has over one hundred degree programs and is well known for getting its students jobs after the leave. The financial planning set forth by the universities founders was astounding and has set up Wyoming residents for success if they choose to take it as well as aloud for cheaper out of state tuition than some universities.']]",University of Wyoming (UW) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wyoming/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/18959,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,98,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00184-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,897415803,897301552,HORIZONTAL,,"08/20/2009 Reviewer is A past student here. 20 out of 30 people found this review useful. 7 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 131 Wesley from Firestone, CO Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For this they have an activity, a different one every Friday, that is free for students and they also show a movie that is still in theaters for free. There is also Cowboy Country Swing Club. This activity is every Thursday night and there occasionally is a live band and people to who just swing dance the night a way.

You get to become pretty good friends with the people on your floor if you put the effort in.', 'The academic rigor is pretty high at the University of Wyoming. It is bearable if you put the effort in to study and go to extra study sessions. When debating on doing homework or going to hang out with friends, ALWAYS opt to do the homework first and in a timely manner. In other words do not procrastinate it will help you in the long run and help relieve some stress.', 'Tips that I would give would be to be courage and spontaneous. Try new things and look for different activities that may be going on around campus, ya never know when there may be free food available. Talk to your teachers and go to extra study groups to help you understand the class and the concepts better, trust me it is better to go the extra mile. Take classes that may not be required for your major just to branch out a little and have a little break from those harder classes.', 'The University of Wyoming is a clean and friendly environment.

It has been small for a while and now with new leadership there is a positive future for it. The fraternities and sororities are very involved on campus and in the community and push each other through healthy competition to be leaders on the campus. I am in a fraternity and I would strongly recommend Greek life to anyone else because of all the memories I've made and people I've met. The people you meet will impact you for the rest of your life and help you become the person you want to be. Greek life does events such as socials among other Greek houses, philanthropy events, campus events, community events, member events, and much more. Rush week is at the start of every school year for new students to see each house and get an idea about what each house is about. That is where you can see which place is a fit for you if you are interest and if not it is a good place to meet some really cool people."", ""This campus is great for all types of students. Whether you like staying inside and reading books or going outside and running around all day there is always plenty to your disposal. The library is huge with a lot of useful stuff to help you study and the outdoors places are endless. This campus is a very diverse campus and anyone who comes won't have a hard time finding somewhere to fit in."", 'The University of Wyoming has a great academic program and is very cheap for instate and out of state students. With the low cost of attendance and the quality of education there is no place better! I would really recommend this university to anyone looking to join a college and the reward is definitely worth the small price you pay.', 'There is plenty on campus to do for fun. The university offers many clubs and extracurricular activities that students can to to stay busy. There are many clubs that you can join and most help you academically and help you create an attractive resume. There is a great gym here for those who like to work out and the university is constantly providing intramural sports for those who like to compete against other students on campus. Greek life is another great way to get involved with other students and is a great way to do things around campus and throughout the community of Laramie. With outdoor places surrounding Laramie you can always make a quick trip out to the mountains to hike, camp, climb and fish. During the winter there is a snowboarding place not too far from Laramie where you can ski and board for cheap. Aside from that you can always find people outside when the weather is nice and they are very open to tag-alongs to join them in whatever they are doing.', 'Washakie is the food and dining services offered at the University of Wyoming and is centralized between all of the dorms. The food there is not terribly bad and it is very easy to just walk on over to eat. The only downside to it is that Washakie is not very cheap and you could save much more money eating elsewhere. But for students Washakie is a great way to make sure that you are able to eat conveniently and you will never go hungry.', ""Dorm life was alright, I wouldn't say that it was bad but it all really depends on your roommate and the type of person you are. I never really got too involved with my floor because they were all taking classes that I wasn't but hearing from others the dorms can be a great place to meet some life long friends in college."", 'The classes here can be pretty tough and you can fall behind fast if you do not pay attention or miss class. Make it a habit to be attentive and ready for class each day and be sure to study outside of the class so you are not stressing too much before the tests. In most cases the professor will be more than willing to help you outside of the class to help make the classes less stressful and difficult. Overall though these classes will get you ready for the real world and are very beneficial to your future.', 'Be proactive. Get as much information as you can from the different departments so you can hit the ground running and waste to time starting your college experience. Explore all possibilities and activities that the university has to offer (clubs, student senate, Greek life, etc.) and study hard for the classes you take. Also be sure to start filling out scholarships as soon as you can so you are financially set for your future.', 'I absolutely love the University of Wyoming.

I feel comfortable walking around campus alone at anytime. We have safty phones located strategically around Prexy's Pasture. Our campus police are involved in our activities and can be very fun to hang out with during events. They are usually UW graduates and have many stories to tell. When there are emergencies, all students get up to date text messages and alerts on their phones/Facebook/Twitter/etc so we all know what is going on."", 'I am not a part of Greek life but I have several friends who are. I know that our chapters are very much a part of the entire UW community and help put on events for the whole school as well as their own events. I have gone to our homecoming sing contest many times and had a great time with the people in Fraturnities and Sororities.', 'I am a part of the Energy and Natural Resources club, the Society of Women Engineers, Architectural Engineering club, soon to be Hula Hoop club, Ultimate Frisbee team, and the Sustainablility club. There are many, many more clubs and anyone can make a club so long as you have at least 4 members.', 'Outdoor enthusists Engineers Agriculture', ""We like to sing the 'beer song' at home football and other sporting games. It is also a tradition to try and throw a pinecone into our large skeleton statue of a T-rex's mouth before finals. If you get a pinecone in his mouth you will supposedly ace all your finals. Beware though, for if you miss, you will fail all of them. I think, though, that Prexy's pasture is one of our best locations on campus. It is a green area in the center of all of campus with sidewalk criss crossed through for convienient access to many of the buildings. What's cool about Prexy's is that the sidewalk is paved according to students' walking patterns, which means after this year we will be adding another sidewalk area directly to the agriculture building due to a ton of foot traffic over this year wearing a path into the pasture."", ""UW has one of the lowest tuition rates, especially for students from Wyoming itself. However, this does not mean that our academics are any less appealing. I really enjoy UW and what frustrates me most is when people say that they are only going here because it is 'cheap'. So if you do not want to go to Laramie and are thinking of only coming here because it is cheap, please don't. Go some place you are going to love and be happy. I am very happy here in Laramie, and it dissapoints me when I see people who are not."", ""Lots of time outside! There is great rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, a great farmer's market and much more in the Summer/Fall/Spring. In the Winter we have skiing, snowboarding, cross country skiing, and ice climbing pretty close as well. Other than that, we have two movie theaters (one plays old movies for $3), ice cream and frozen yogurt, ice skating, bowling, resturants, bars, and other city stuff. Just less of it. It is Wyoming, afterall. But there is plenty to do if you choose to do it."", 'We have a few resturants on campus, the best I think being Elements which is a yummy sandwich and coffee shop located in the Classroom building where most freshmen classes are. Otherwise we have Panda, a pizza place, a little gyro place and a subway by the dorms.', 'The dorms here are good. Since UW is the only 4 year college in WY, we have a good bit of funding which the school uses to bring in exciting artists and speakers, all of which is free to UW students. This really helps one in the dorms because campus is literally a couple minutes away. There are also tunnels from all of the freshmen dorms to the dining center for when it is really chilly outside. You can use them whenever you would like though.', ""I have really enjoyed the math classes here, especially our calculus professors. They make math exciting while academically rigorus. I have also taken some wonderful anthropology classes that were rigorus in their writing and technical training. However, it seems that many students here can procrastinate very much, myself included. This I really don't like. It is definitly a school where you have to push yourself and not let yourself slack off with maybe some other students."", 'Come to campus and explore Laramie to see if you will enjoy your time here. You should also talk to the professors in your selected major at any school you are thinking of going to. They truly can make your college experience.', 'Laramie is a small town and the university is a medium sized school. They do very well with engineering, buisness and medical undergraduate degrees.

XML | CSV | Download as All Senate votes use these words. But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses Ã¢Â€ÂœyeaÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœnayÃ¢Â€? when voting on the final passage of bills. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in Ã¢Â€Âœordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.Ã¢Â€? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

Wanted something a little higher than my stock YZ bars so I went with the Reed bars .. Very happy with the bars...only complaint is that is takes very little for the alignment markings and paint (black) to wear off... making the bars look a little ratty after very little wear... just cosmetic -- so 4 stars., 43949=Comments On Mar 26, 2014:First time user of 1 1/8 bars and quite comfortable when mated with the appropriate 7/8 to 1 1/8 bar adapters. Riding hard pack and rocky trails, these bars took some punishment without a hint of bending....it finally bent after a throttle jam and bike cartwheeled before it stopped resulting in a slight bend!! The only downside to these bars are that they are limited in width compared to the 7/8 bars thats l had previously, 33707=Comments On Dec 10, 2014:All my dirt bikes have them.

The following relationships can be derived: Changes to the boundaries for census tracts and, for the first time, for census blocks are available in relationship files, which are only available in computer-readable form. The census tract relationship files feature the relationship of census tracts/block numbering areas at the time of the 1990 census to census tracts for Census 2000, and vice versa, including partial relationships. For the first time, the census tract relationship files show a measure of the magnitude of change using the proportion of the length of roads and sides of roads contained in partial census tracts. This information can be used to proportion the data for the areas where census tracts have changed. The historical counts shown for counties, county subdivisions, places, and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas are not updated for such changes, and thus reflect the population and housing units in each entity as delineated at the time of each decennial census. Boundary changes are not reported for some entities, such as census designated places and block groups. Statistical entity boundaries generally are reviewed by local, state, or tribal governments and can have changes to adjust boundaries to visible features to better define the geographic area","Block relationship files are available to compare the following sets of census blocks: 1990 tabulation block to 2000 collection block, 2000 collection block to 2000 tabulation block, and 1990 tabulation block to 2000 tabulation block. Census tract relationship files and block relationship files are not geographic equivalency files. For a true areal comparison between the census tracts/block numbering areas and blocks used for the 1990 census and the census tracts and blocks used for Census 2000 (as well as other geographic areas), it is necessary to use the 2000 TIGER/LineÃ‚Â® files. The 2000 TIGER/Line files will contain 1990 and 2000 boundaries for counties and statistically equivalent entities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian areas, Alaska Native village statistical areas, census tracts, census blocks, and by derivation from the census blocks, block groups. Census Block back to top Census blocks are areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries, such as city, town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block bounded by city streets. However, census blocks in sparsely settled areas may contain many square miles of territory.
