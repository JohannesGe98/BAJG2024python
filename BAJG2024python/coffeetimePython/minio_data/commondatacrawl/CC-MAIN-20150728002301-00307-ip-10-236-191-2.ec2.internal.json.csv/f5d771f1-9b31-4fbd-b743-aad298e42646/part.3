In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 41477=This document contains corrections to the final regulations to the Commission's rules which were published in the Federal Register on Thursday, November 6, 2014 (79 FR 65906).

SPR has allocated funds for 30 travel awards, 15 of which were specifically reserved for non-North American members. Award winners within North America will receive $500 to assist with their travel and accommodations while attending SPR, and those traveling from outside of North America will receive $1000. To be eligible, student members must: 1) reside outside a 500 mile radius from the annual meeting; 2) be the first author on a poster or paper accepted for presentation at the SPR annual meeting; 3) be up to date with dues, or have applied for for new membership status; and 4) still have pre-doctoral status (i.e. must not have received their Ph.D. by the time of the meeting). Moreover, student members with travel funds available from the laboratory in which they work are not eligible. This year, 124 student members submitted abstracts on which they were the first author, and which were then accepted for presentation. A lottery among these student members was conducted, and eligibility was verified with advisors, resulting in the recipients listed below. Recipients will receive a check in their registration packets at the meeting in Savannah.

Don't forget that there are plenty of opportunities to meet and mingle with other SPR students and members. Here is just a brief sampling of some of the special interests lunches, dinners, and meetings in the works: The Student Social - Tentatively planned for Friday night. Time and location will be finalized soon. The Open Dinner Meeting with the Committee to Promote Student Interests - We were ecstatic to see so many students attend last year's dinner!

Please click here to read more... Special Interest Lunches & Dinners - These events are a wonderful way to connect with others who share your research interests. Typically, the events are organized on an ongoing basis and are announced in various ways (over email, on the website, and posted on the message board at the conference), so keep checking back for topics that pique your special interest. Remember, these are typically no-host meals, which means bring your own funds. W.I.S.E. - Women In Science Lunch Box Discussion (Friday, October 19th, 11:30am-1:00pm). Please join us for the Second Annual Women in Science Lunch Box Discussion. All SPR members, including men, are invited to attend. The discussion topic will be focused on negotiation skills involved in obtaining a competitive salary, sufficient start-up costs, and lab space for new faculty and continuing negotiations relevant to later career stages. Women tend to struggle with negotiation and are more than two times as likely than men to self-report that they feel apprehension and pessimism about the negotiation process. Compared to men, women typically negotiate for less and receive less when they do negotiate (Read more here). The discussion will be facilitated by a panel of invited speakers composed of academic leaders from different workplace environments (e.g., medical setting, research university, small college). Registration for this event is required and lunch will only be provided to registered participants. To register, please contact Becky Levin (rllevin@cyrus.psych.uiuc.edu). Additionally, if you would like to join the W.I.S.E. listserv, please email John Hofmann (jhofmann@reesgroupinc.com) of SPR's management group with the subject ""Subscribe SPR-WISE.""

Roundtable Discussions (All occuring Thursday, October 18th, from 11:30-1:00pm), 30076=Are you interested in research that integrates psychophysiology and clinical science? Do you conduct basic psychophysiology or fMRI research that has clinical applications? Do you use psychophysiology or fMRI methods to study clinical populations? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you should consider joining the Clinical Psychophysiology Subcommittee. The aims of this committee are to create networking opportunities among clinical psychophysiologists, to facilitate discussions about clinical applications of psychophysiology and fMRI research, and to stimulate collaborations among clinical psychophysiologists across the world. This year at the SPR Convention, the Clinical Psychophysiology Subcommittee will host an Education and Training Roundtable Discussion. During this luncheon, students will have the opportunity to have lunch with several prominent clinical psychophysiologists.
