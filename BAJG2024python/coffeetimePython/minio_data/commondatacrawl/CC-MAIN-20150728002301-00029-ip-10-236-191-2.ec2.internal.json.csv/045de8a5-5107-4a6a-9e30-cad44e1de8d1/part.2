Bernstein, who was hired following the 2007-08 season, was in charge of both the boys and girls swimming program. An announcement for applications has already been posted on the Los Alamos Public SchoolsÃ¢Â€Â™ website. Initially, Bernstein was hired as co-head coach of the swimming program along with Cindy Black. The two coaches didnÃ¢Â€Â™t apply together, but the programÃ¢Â€Â™s swimmers at the time helped convinced the hiring committee co-head coaches were the way to go. Black vacated her half of the coaching position in 2010 and Bernstein took over as the sole head coach since that time. This season, Los Alamos advanced 10 boys and 8 girls to the state championship meet. Los AlamosÃ¢Â€Â™ girls finished in sixth place with 170.5 points and Los AlamosÃ¢Â€Â™ boys ended up in 10th place with 96.5 points. With Bernstein leading the program, the Hilltopper girls had a runner-up finish at state in 2010 and a third-place finish in 2009. Los AlamosÃ¢Â€Â™ boys were third at state in 2009 and fourth in 2010.

In iMovie Ã¢Â€Â™09, we imported a camera archive and exported it to iTunes using the Mobile Devices setting. We ran a Timedemo at 1024-by-768 with 4X anti-aliasing on in Call of Duty 4. We imported 200 JPEGs into iPhoto Ã¢Â€Â™09. The Photoshop Suite test is a set of 23 scripted tasks using a 50MB file. PhotoshopÃ¢Â€Â™s memory was set to 70 percent and History was set to Minimum. For our multitasking test, we timed the Photoshop test again, but with the iTunes MP3 encoding and file compression tests running in the background. We used Handbrake to encode four chapters from a DVD previously ripped to the hard drive to H.264. We recorded how long it took to render a scene with multiprocessors in Cinebench and ran that application's OpenGL, frames per second test. We ran the Evaluate Notebook test in MathematicaMark 7. We ran the WorldBench 6 multitasking test on a Parallels 6 VM running Windows 7 Professional. We timed the import and processing time for 200 photos in Aperture.Ã¢Â€Â”Macworld Lab testing by James Galbraith, McKinley Noble, Gil Loyola, and William Wang, 69529=Ã‚Â© 1998-2015, IDG Consumer & SMB}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:38:46 GMT","Speedmark 6.5 results: Mac minis and iMacs Single Page print e-mail Oct 7, 2010 6:00 AM Macworld Staff, Macworld By Speedmark 6.5 test results Macs Home The latest hardware reviews and testing straight from Macworld Lab From the Lab $('#inread').responsiveAd({screenSize:'971 1115', scriptTags: []}); IDG.GPT.addSlot(""inread"", [1,1]); IDG.GPT.addDisplayedAd(""inread"", ""true""); $('#gpt-leaderboardmobile').responsiveAd({screenSize:'971 1115', scriptTags: []}); IDG.GPT.addDisplayedAd(""gpt-leaderboardmobile"", ""true""); $('#gpt-leaderboard').responsiveAd({screenSize:'971 1115', scriptTags: []}); IDG.GPT.addDisplayedAd(""gpt-leaderboard"", ""true"");","48 70 27-inch iMac 3.4GHz Core i7 4GB RAM (BTO, Mid 2011) 20 130 45 63 21.5"" iMac 3.06GHz Core i3 dual-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010) 19 166 42 77 21.5"" iMac 3.2GHz Core i3 dual-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010) 19 160 42 67 27"" iMac 3.2GHz Core i3 dual-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010) 20 161 43 76 27"" iMac 2.8GHz Core i5 quad-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010) 21 170 44 76 27"" iMac 2.93GHz Core i7 quad-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010, BTO) 17 157 36 71 27"" iMac 3.6GHz Core i5 dual-core 4GB RAM SSD (Mid 2010, BTO) 14 131 24 56 27"" iMac 3.6GHz Core i5 dual-core 4GB RAM (Mid 2010, BTO) 17 140 36 65 21.5"" iMac 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo 4GB RAM (Late 2009) 20 177 40 85 27"" iMac 2.66GHz Core i5 quad-core 4GB RAM (Late 2009) 22 179 43 76 24"" iMac 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo 2GB RAM (Early 2008) 29 190 58 86 24"" iMac 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo 2GB RAM (Mid 2007) 31 235 65 109 Results are in seconds.

Continuing the example in subsection (3) above, if the CPI% with respect to a payment due in 2001 is 6%, then the Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in 2001 would be 9.1800000% (an additional 6% applied on the 3% Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in 2000), and if the CPI% with respect to a payment due in 2002 is 4%, then the Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in 2002 would be 13.5472000% (an additional 4% applied on the 9.1800000% Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in 2001). The Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable to payments due in the year 2000 shall be equal to the greater of 3% or the CPI%. For example, if the Consumer Price Index for December 1999 (as released in January 2000) is 2% higher than the Consumer Price Index for December","Applying the Inflation Adjustment: Using the hypothetical Inflation Adjustment Percentages set forth in section (7)(a): the subsection IX(c)(1) base payment amount for 2002 of $6,500,000,000 as adjusted for inflation would equal $7,137,204,750; the subsection IX(c)(1) base payment amount for 2004 of $8,000,000,000 as adjusted for inflation would equal $9,455,368,856; the subsection IX(c)(1) base payment amount for 2006 of $8,000,000,000 as adjusted for inflation would equal $10,031,200,816.

In particular, it has three main responsibilities: To expose Information as a Service (IaaS) To manipulate data entries in different services and service components To control access to certain selected aspects of data; disable some data parts from outside access This ABB acts as the gateway to the Information Layer. This ABB enables the hosting and exposure of information services by the SOA RA, forming a virtual data layer. It thus supports interfacing between the Information Layer and consumers of information services and is critical to expose Information as a Service (IaaS). It provides a consistent entry point to the Information Layer through multiple mechanisms such as messaging, service calls, and batch processing. This ABB leverages capabilities and ABBs from the Integration Layer. Data Aggregator This ABB is responsible for efficiently joining information Ã¢Â€Â“ for example, structured and unstructured data Ã¢Â€Â“ from multiple sources without creating data redundancy to help form a unified data view/model supported by the Data Virtualization Manager ABB. Its responsibilities include: Dispatching requests to other ABBs in the Information Layer Invoking the Data Virtualization Manager ABB for handling data transformation (including transformation of data types and contents);",True,1,0

It is associated with the inner face of the plasma membrane and could play a role as a regulatory protein in receptor-mediated signal transduction. Alternative splicing occurs at this locus and two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]. shRNA Design: These shRNA constructs were designed against multiple splice variants at this gene locus. To be certain that your variant of interest is targeted, align it with our published shRNA design sequences. If these do not align, please utilize our custom shRNA service. Performance Guranteed: OriGene guarantees that the sequences in the shRNA expression cassettes are verified to correspond to the target gene with 100% identity. One of the four constructs at minimum are guaranteed to produce 70% or more gene expression knock-down provided a minimum transfection efficiency of 80% is achieved.

Amount of increase is not known at this time. A long portion of the session that began at 4:30 p.m. and ended nearly four hours later was a joint meeting with the Water and Wastewater Utility Commission. And approval of a motion to aplply to WPSC for a rate increase was unanimously approved by both boards. The series of meetings at the Water Utility building on Water Street began with a meeting of the Civic Affairs, Cemetery, Traffic & Lights Committee, which led to contoversial recommendations to pledge continued support for the Logging and Heritage Festival despite objections to lack of fireworks and parade on the Fourth of July; agreement, with a dissenting vote cast by Alderman Shirley Kaufman, to turn over most of the care and maintenance of the Catholic portion of Woodlawn and Calvary cemeteries to Holy Family Parish of Marinette; and discussion of improvements to Menekaunee Heritage Park as explained by former Alderman Sandy Saunier.","Peshtigo Times WEB Poll!

A trackday is a private day on the NÃƒÂ¼rburgring Nordschleife. Instead of opening to all as a public road, like in the touristenfahrten sessions, the track is hired by a club or company only for their paying guests. No bikes, no busses. The club make their own rules and we can normally drive lap after lap, with no stopping for the ticket barrier each and every lap! Trackdays also present the perfect opportunity to learn more about the Nordschleife with the help of an experienced coach. Instruction costs Ã¢Â‚Â¬49 per lap, Ã¢Â‚Â¬149 per hour or Ã¢Â‚Â¬749 for a whole day. We'll be glad to answer any questions.

Among these particles, the most dangerous are those less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which are so tiny that they can evade the lung's natural defenses, enter the bloodstream, and be transported to vital organs. Impacts are especially severe among the elderly, children, and those with respiratory disease. The study found that over 13,000 deaths and tens of thousands of cases of chronic bronchitis, acute bronchitis, asthma, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, chronic lung disease, and pneumonia each year are attributable to fine particle pollution from U.S. coal plant emissions. These deaths and illnesses are major examples of coal's external costs, i.e. uncompensated harms inflicted upon the public at large. Low-income and minority populations are disproportionately impacted as well, due to the tendency of companies to avoid locating power plants upwind of affluent communities. To monetize the health impact of fine particle pollution from each coal plant, Abt assigned a value of $7,300,000 to each 2010 mortality, based on a range of government and private studies. Valuations of illnesses ranged from $52 for an asthma episode to $440,000 for a case of chronic bronchitis.[4], 4989=On April 22, 2013, WP&L settled air pollution violations with the EPA by agreeing to spend $1.2 billion to clean up coal-fired power plants and shut down older plants. The company agreed to stop burning coal at the Nelson Dewey Generating Station in Cassville and two of the three boilers at the Edgewater Generating Station in Sheboygan, retiring 590 megawatts of coal. The company will also add pollution controls to the Edgewater Generating Station and the Columbia Energy Center in Portage, co-owned by Madison Gas & Electric.[2], 5839=In March of 2008 Alliant Energy based in Madison, Wisconsin received a notice of intent to sue from the Sierra Club. The notice claimed that the company did not file applications for air permit renewal on a timely basis and in doing so violated the Clean Air Act. In 2009, as a result of pressure from the Sierra Club and others, the federal government revoked its permit to the Columbia Energy Center. The result could mean that Alliant will be forced to install pollution reduction equipment or it could mean shutting down the facility for good.[1]}","{1402=In August 2010 a study released by the Environmental Integrity Project, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice reported that Wisconsin, along with 34 states, had significant groundwater contamination from coal ash that was not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

WÃƒÂ¤hrend sie in einigen Regionen, wie den skandinavischen LÃƒÂ¤ndern, sehr niedrig ist Ã¢Â€Â“Ã‚Â in Finnland (wo eine Impfpflicht besteht)[13] traten seit 1996 lediglich vier importierte FÃƒÂ¤lle auf[14]Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“, ist das in Mittel- und Osteuropa oft noch nicht der Fall. Dort kommt es aufgrund von ImpflÃƒÂ¼cken immer wieder zu lokalen KrankheitsausbrÃƒÂ¼chen. Trotz Meldepflicht in den meisten LÃƒÂ¤ndern existiert wahrscheinlich eine hohe Dunkelziffer, und die Zahl der tatsÃƒÂ¤chlichen KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤lle liegt wesentlich hÃƒÂ¶her als die der gemeldeten. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) appellierte 2011 an die EU-Mitgliedstaaten, MaÃƒÂŸnahmen zur BekÃƒÂ¤mpfung der Masern zu verstÃƒÂ¤rken.[15], 87699=In ÃƒÂ–sterreich werden zwei Teilimpfungen im zweiten Lebensjahr mit einem Mindestabstand von einem Monat empfohlen. Wiederholungen der Impfung werden bei Schuleintritt im siebten Lebensjahr und im 13. Lebensjahr vom ÃƒÂ¶ffentlichen Gesundheitsdienst kostenlos angeboten.[71] Die Rate der Masernimpfung in ÃƒÂ–sterreich wurde fÃƒÂ¼r 2006 von der WHO auf 80Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Erst- und 61Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Zweitimpfung geschÃƒÂ¤tzt.[72], 16256=Im Jahr 2008 wurde vom U.S.-amerikanischen CDC auf einen Ausbruch von Masern in Israel hingewiesen, wo mehr als 900 FÃƒÂ¤lle bekanntgeworden sind, 700 davon in Jerusalem und Bet Schemesch.[10] In SÃƒÂ¼dafrika grassierte von 2009 bis 2011 eine Masernepidemie mit ÃƒÂ¼ber 18.000 gemeldeten FÃƒÂ¤llen (13.000 laborbestÃƒÂ¤tigt).[11] In Pakistan sind, nachdem bereits im Jahr 2012 ÃƒÂ¼ber 300 Maserntote gezÃƒÂ¤hlt wurden, bei einem im Dezember 2012 begonnen schweren Masernausbruch bis August 2013 ÃƒÂ¼ber 300 (meist) Kinder an der Krankheit gestorben. Dort wurden 2013 ÃƒÂ¼ber 8.000 Masernerkrankungen bestÃƒÂ¤tigt, fÃƒÂ¼r 2014 bisher ÃƒÂ¼ber 1.300.[12], 103071=Im Mittelalter forderten die Masern aufgrund ausgedehnter Epidemien viele Todesopfer. Nach der Entdeckung Amerikas starb ein groÃƒÂŸer Teil der einheimischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung an den aus Europa importierten Krankheiten wie Masern, Pocken, Keuchhusten und Typhus. Der Grund dafÃƒÂ¼r war, dass die einheimischen Populationen keinerlei ImmunitÃƒÂ¤t gegen diese Erreger aufwiesen.[84] So kam es in Santo Domingo (1519), Guatemala (1523) und Mexiko (1531) zu verheerenden Masernepidemien. Im Jahre 1529 kam es zu einer sich ÃƒÂ¼ber Honduras und Mittelamerika ausbreitenden Masernepidemie, die zwei Drittel der ÃƒÂœberlebenden der zuvor ausgebrochenen Pockenepidemie das Leben kostete.[85], 27511=In den Niederlanden wird aufgrund einer orthodox-protestantischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerungsgruppe (Orthodox gereformeerde kerken), die aus religiÃƒÂ¶sen GrÃƒÂ¼nden eine Impfung ablehnt, ein epidemisches Auftreten der Masern in regelmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸigen AbstÃƒÂ¤nden beobachtet. 1999 kam es zu einem Ausbruch mit 2961 Erkrankungen und drei TodesfÃƒÂ¤llen, zwischen Mai 2013 und MÃƒÂ¤rz 2014 wurden ÃƒÂ¼ber 2600 Masernerkrankungen gemeldet, 182 wurden im Krankenhaus behandelt und ein Kind starb.[32], 88416=Die Empfehlungen des Bundesamtes fÃƒÂ¼r Gesundheit und der Schweizerischen Kommission fÃƒÂ¼r Impffragen sehen zwei MMR-Impfungen im Alter von 12 und 15Ã¢Â€Â“24 Monaten vor.[73] Die WHO schÃƒÂ¤tzt die Impfrate in der Schweiz fÃƒÂ¼r 2006 auf 86Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Erstimpfung und 70Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Zweitimpfung.[72], 22404=Zwischen Oktober 2014 und April 2015 kam es in Berlin zu mehr als 1000 Erkrankungen. WÃƒÂ¤hrend des FrÃƒÂ¼hjahrs 2015 lag die Anzahl der wÃƒÂ¶chentlichen Neuerkrankungen in Berlin, ThÃƒÂ¼ringen und Sachsen jeweils im mittleren zweistelligen Bereich.[20][21] Der Virusstamm war vermutlich durch Asylsuchende aus Bosnien und Herzegowina und Serbien, die auch als erste erkrankten, eingeschleppt worden. In Bosnien und Herzegowina grassierte bereits seit Februar 2014 eine grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸere Masern-Epidemie mit mehreren Tausend Betroffenen.[22] Die Daten im Epidemiologischen Bulletin fÃƒÂ¼r 2013 lassen vermuten, dass Masern in Deutschland bald wieder endemisch sein werden.[23], 30061=Bis 1994 fÃƒÂ¼hrten nahezu alle Staaten der UN-Region Amerika Impfprogramme fÃƒÂ¼r Kinder ein. Dadurch verringerte sich die durchschnittliche Zahl der Neuerkrankungen von 250.000 auf etwa 100 FÃƒÂ¤lle pro Jahr, die Masern gelten damit als faktisch ausgerottet. Regional treten noch vereinzelte KrankheitsausbrÃƒÂ¼che auf, die nahezu alle importiert sind oder auf importierte Masern zurÃƒÂ¼ckgefÃƒÂ¼hrt werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[8][35] Amerika ist somit ein Beispiel dafÃƒÂ¼r, dass die Masern durch Impfprogramme weltweit beherrscht werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[36], 28207=2002 kam es in der Region Kampanien im sÃƒÂ¼dlichen Italien zu einer weiteren lokalen Epidemie mit 1571 KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤llen, von denen drei zum Tode fÃƒÂ¼hrten.[33] In RumÃƒÂ¤nien erkrankten 2005 ÃƒÂ¼ber 3600 Personen an den Masern, zehn Kinder starben daran., 106702=1911 gelang es erstmals, Affen mit Masern zu infizieren. 1927 entwickelte Rudolf Degkwitz die passive Masernschutzimpfung (Ã¢Â†Â‘Postexpositionsprophylaxe).[88] 1954 wurde das Virus von Enders und Peebles erstmals isoliert.[89] Dies fÃƒÂ¼hrte 1958 zur Entwicklung des ersten Impfstoffes, der ab 1963 allgemein erhÃƒÂ¤ltlich war., 95190=Weitere mÃƒÂ¶gliche Nebenwirkungen wurden immer wieder kontrovers diskutiert. Nach dem heutigen Kenntnisstand lÃƒÂ¶st die MMR-Impfung keine Erkrankungen wie Allergien, Asthma, Diabetes mellitus oder Morbus Crohn aus. 1998 postulierte der ehemalige[77] britische Chirurg Andrew Wakefield einen Zusammenhang zwischen der MMR-Impfung und dem Auftreten von Autismus. Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass Wakefield von AngehÃƒÂ¶rigen Autismus-Betroffener Geld erhalten hatte, und die VerÃƒÂ¶ffentlichung gilt als methodisch mangelhaft. Siehe auch Ã¢Â€ÂžDer Fall WakefieldÃ¢Â€Âœ., 80174=Nach dem deutschen Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG) aus dem Jahr 2001 dÃƒÂ¼rfen infizierte Kinder solange keine Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen besuchen, bis sie nach Abklingen der Erkrankung keine Viren mehr ausscheiden und keine weiteren Personen mehr infizieren kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Unter Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen werden dabei Institutionen verstanden, in denen ÃƒÂ¼berwiegend SÃƒÂ¤uglinge, Kinder oder Jugendliche betreut werden, wie Kinderkrippen, KindergÃƒÂ¤rten, KindertagesstÃƒÂ¤tten, Kinderhorte, Schulen oder sonstige Ausbildungseinrichtungen, auÃƒÂŸerdem Heime und Ferienlager. Dieselbe Regelung gilt auch fÃƒÂ¼r die BeschÃƒÂ¤ftigten dieser Einrichtungen.[65] In anderen LÃƒÂ¤ndern bestehen vergleichbare Regelungen. Sogenannte Ã¢Â€ÂžMasernpartysÃ¢Â€Âœ[66] Ã¢Â€Â“ organisierte Treffen, bei denen nicht gegen Masern geimpfte Kinder sich bei Kindern, die akut an Masern erkrankt sind, anstecken sollen Ã¢Â€Â“ sind strafrechtlich relevant.[67], 14833=Auf der anderen Seite konnte das Virus durch groÃƒÂŸ angelegte Impfkampagnen in verschiedenen anderen Regionen, so dem gesamten amerikanischen Doppelkontinent, bereits weitgehend eliminiert werden, was dadurch mÃƒÂ¶glich ist, dass der Mensch der einzige Wirt des Masernvirus ist. 2001 legten die WHO und UNICEF einen Plan vor mit dem Ziel, die Sterblichkeitsrate bei Kindern durch weltweite Impfprogramme bis zum Jahr 2005 zu halbieren. WÃƒÂ¤hrend genaue Daten noch ausstehen, zeigen verschiedene Berichte, dass dieses Ziel zu einem groÃƒÂŸen Teil erreicht wurde. Von 1999 bis 2003 gelang eine weltweite Reduktion der Masern-Sterblichkeit um 39Ã‚Â %, wobei weiterhin hohe Sterblichkeitsraten in Afrika und SÃƒÂ¼dostasien bestehen.[7] 2005 adaptierte die World Health Assembly der WHO diese PlÃƒÂ¤ne und formulierte fÃƒÂ¼r das Jahr 2010 das Ziel einer 90-prozentigen Reduktion der weltweiten Sterblichkeit.[8] Dieses Ziel wurde laut WHO nicht erreicht. Von weltweit 535.300 (geschÃƒÂ¤tzt) Maserntoten im Jahr 2000 sank die Zahl bis 2010 auf 139.300, dies entspricht einer Senkung um 74Ã‚Â %.[9], 104405=Das PhÃƒÂ¤nomen, dass das Masernvirus dann eine hohe LetalitÃƒÂ¤t zeigt, wenn es auf eine zuvor unberÃƒÂ¼hrte, nicht-immune BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung trifft, findet sich mehrfach auch im 19. Jahrhundert. So starben 40.000 der 148.000 Einwohner von Hawaii im Jahre 1848 und etwa ein Viertel der BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung der Fidschi-Inseln 1874.[86], 13661=Das Masernvirus kommt weltweit vor, wobei die KrankheitshÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit stark variiert. Insbesondere in EntwicklungslÃƒÂ¤ndern kommt es immer wieder zu lokalen Masernepidemien mit hohen Krankheits- und Sterblichkeitszahlen.[4][5] Die Masern gehÃƒÂ¶ren dort zu den hÃƒÂ¤ufigsten Infektionskrankheiten. Laut SchÃƒÂ¤tzung der WHO haben sie im Jahr 2000 fast die HÃƒÂ¤lfte der 1,7Ã‚Â Millionen durch Impfung vermeidbaren TodesfÃƒÂ¤lle bei Kindern verursacht, bei geschÃƒÂ¤tzten 30 bis 40 Millionen KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤llen in jenem Jahr.[6] Die Zahl der gemeldeten Erkrankungen liegt aufgrund der hohen Dunkelziffer weit unter diesen geschÃƒÂ¤tzten Werten (siehe Tabelle)., 25767=In der Schweiz kam es 1997 zu einer Epidemie mit 6400 Erkrankungen. Die Daten der Schweiz basieren auf dem Sentinella-Meldesystem.[27] Nach 574 FÃƒÂ¤llen im Jahr 2003 wurden 2004 mit 39 FÃƒÂ¤llen und 2005 mit 60 FÃƒÂ¤llen wesentlich niedrigere Erkrankungsraten gemeldet.[2] Seit November 2006 breitet sich eine neue Epidemie aus. Bis Ende 2007 wurden mehr als 1100 Erkrankungen gemeldet, der Schwerpunkt lag dabei im Kanton Luzern.[28] Anfang 2008 verschÃƒÂ¤rfte sich die Lage vor allem in der Nordwest- und Ostschweiz, bis Mitte MÃƒÂ¤rz gab es schon 734 neue MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle. Verschiedene KantonsÃƒÂ¤rzte empfahlen daher vorbeugende Masernimpfungen.[29] Im Februar 2009 erkrankten an der Rudolf-Steiner-Schule in Crissier rund 40 SchÃƒÂ¼ler an Masern. Daraufhin wurden 250 SchÃƒÂ¼ler fÃƒÂ¼r drei Wochen von der Schule ausgeschlossen.[30] Im Dezember 2010 bis Januar 2011 wurden in der Schweiz 31 FÃƒÂ¤lle an der Rudolf-Steiner-Schule in Basel gemeldet.[31], 20754=2005 kam es in Deutschland zu zwei grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸeren MasernausbrÃƒÂ¼chen, im Februar in Hessen mit einem Todesfall bei 223 ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤llen und im Mai in Oberbayern mit 110 Erkrankungen. 2006 wurden MasernhÃƒÂ¤ufungen in Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg sowie in Nordrhein-Westfalen gemeldet. Dies war die grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Masernepidemie seit EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Masern-Meldepflicht im Jahr 2001.[17] 2013 kam es in MÃƒÂ¼nchen zu einer Epidemie. Nach Angaben des dortigen Gesundheitsreferats wurden von April bis Anfang Juni 220 FÃƒÂ¤lle registriert, verglichen mit sieben im Vorjahr. ÃƒÂœber die HÃƒÂ¤lfte der Patienten musste in Kliniken behandelt werden, besonders hÃƒÂ¤ufig erkrankten Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene.[18] Eine SchÃƒÂ¼lerin brachte das Virus dann an eine Waldorfschule im Rhein-Erft-Kreis, wo es bei einer Impfquote von nur 25Ã‚Â % bei 400 SchÃƒÂ¼lern zu einem weiteren Masernausbruch im Juli 2013 kam. Es erkrankten 54 Menschen, davon 29 Jugendliche und Erwachsene. Drei Patienten mussten stationÃƒÂ¤r im Krankenhaus behandelt werden. Da auch der Impfschutz der Lehrer sehr niedrig war, musste die Schule fÃƒÂ¼r sechs Tage geschlossen werden.[19], 4708=Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) strebt die weltweite Ausrottung der Masern an. Durch Impfungen konnte die Zahl der Erkrankungen in der Vergangenheit stark reduziert werden, von 1980 bis 2013 um ÃƒÂ¼ber 95Ã‚Â %. In Regionen mit hoher Impfrate wie bspw. Nord- und SÃƒÂ¼damerika sind Masern bis auf wenige importierte FÃƒÂ¤lle de facto bereits ausgerottet, dort wurden im Jahr 2014 weniger als 2000 FÃƒÂ¤lle bestÃƒÂ¤tigt.[1], 30931=Die Anzahl der Masernerkrankungen in den USA sank nach der EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung des Impfstoffes 1963 von ÃƒÂ¼ber 500.000 auf einige wenige FÃƒÂ¤lle im Jahr. Einen starken Anstieg der FÃƒÂ¤lle gab es jedoch von 1989 bis 1991. In diesen drei Jahren wurden ÃƒÂ¼ber 50.000 ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤lle berichtet, von denen 123 tÃƒÂ¶dlich endeten. HauptsÃƒÂ¤chlich waren Kleinkinder aus hispanoamerikanischen und afroamerikanischen Familien betroffen, bei denen die Rate ungeimpfter Kinder deutlich hÃƒÂ¶her war als bei der GesamtbevÃƒÂ¶lkerung. Mittlerweile treten genuine, also nicht importierte, Masernerkrankungen in den Staaten Nord- und SÃƒÂ¼damerikas mit Einschluss der Karibik kaum noch auf.[37] Die Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sehen die Masern in den USA nicht mehr als endemische Krankheit an.[8], 53000=ÃƒÂœber die Sterblichkeitsrate gibt es verschiedene Angaben. Das Robert-Koch-Institut nennt eine LetalitÃƒÂ¤t von 1:1000.[48] Die US-amerikanische CDC geht von einer Sterblichkeit von 1:500 bis 1:1000 aus.[49] Das Zentrum fÃƒÂ¼r PrÃƒÂ¤vention und Kontrolle von Krankheiten der EU berechnet eine Sterblichkeit von 3:1000.[50] In EntwicklungslÃƒÂ¤ndern liegt die Todesrate wesentlich hÃƒÂ¶her, teilweise bei bis zu 25Ã‚Â %.[8] LungenentzÃƒÂ¼ndungen sind die am hÃƒÂ¤ufigsten zum Tode fÃƒÂ¼hrenden Komplikationen., 96656=Obwohl die Impfung gegen Masern als notwendig und sicher gilt, wurde in einzelnen Publikationen kritisiert, dass die Studien zur Untersuchung der Nebenwirkungen der MMR-Impfung nicht ausfÃƒÂ¼hrlich genug und bezÃƒÂ¼glich des Studiendesigns teilweise inadÃƒÂ¤quat seien.[78] Dagegen hat Ende 2013 das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) alle vom 1. Januar 2001 bis 31. Dezember 2012 gemeldeten VerdachtsfÃƒÂ¤lle ausgewertet. Es konnte kein neues Risikosignal entdeckt werden, damit bleibt das PEI bei einer positiven Risiko-Nutzen-Bewertung der monovalenten und kombinierten Masernimpfstoffe.[81], 35549=Die WHO definiert 23 bisher bekannte Genotypen (Variationen der genetischen Informationen) in acht Gruppen (AÃ¢Â€Â“H).[39] Die Mutationsrate der Genome ist vergleichsweise gering, wodurch weltweite (geografische) Infektionswege nachvollzogen werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[40] In Mitteleuropa kommen vor allem die Genotypen C2, D6 und D7 vor. Die MasernausbrÃƒÂ¼che in der Schweiz und in Niederbayern 2006/2007 waren hingegen durch den aus Thailand oder Kambodscha stammenden Genotyp D5 verursacht.[41] Dies ermÃƒÂ¶glichte den Nachweis einer Infektkette von der Schweiz nach Niederbayern und von dort weiter nach ÃƒÂ–sterreich und Hannover, da der Genotyp D5 in Mitteleuropa sonst nur in EinzelfÃƒÂ¤llen auftritt. Weiterhin existiert nur ein stabiler Serotyp (Kombination von OberflÃƒÂ¤chenmerkmalen des Erregers), weshalb ein gut wirksamer Impfstoff hergestellt werden konnte., 23564=In ÃƒÂ–sterreich wurde vor der EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Masern-Meldepflicht 2001 vom Institut fÃƒÂ¼r Virologie (Wien) ein freiwilliges Meldesystem betrieben, das etwa 8Ã‚Â % der ÃƒÂ¶sterreichischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung abdeckte. Somit konnten fÃƒÂ¼r den Zeitraum von 1993 bis 1997 etwa 28.000 bis 30.000 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle fÃƒÂ¼r ganz ÃƒÂ–sterreich hochgerechnet werden, wobei besonders 1996 und 1997 ein gehÃƒÂ¤uftes Auftreten von Masernerkrankungen zu verzeichnen war. Die Zahl der jÃƒÂ¤hrlichen FÃƒÂ¤lle lag zwischen 2003 und 2007 jeweils unter 100 pro Jahr.[2] Ab MÃƒÂ¤rz 2008 breitete sich von einer Waldorfschule im Raum Salzburg eine Masernepidemie ÃƒÂ¼ber fast alle ÃƒÂ¶sterreichischen und zwei deutsche BundeslÃƒÂ¤nder aus. In Salzburg wurden 241 FÃƒÂ¤lle gemeldet, 146 in OberÃƒÂ¶sterreich, 22 in Wien, 13 in Tirol und 10 in Vorarlberg.[24] Im Zusammenhang mit dieser Epidemie erkrankten nach Auskunft bayerischer BehÃƒÂ¶rden zwischen Mitte MÃƒÂ¤rz und Mitte Juli 2008 auch insgesamt 217 Personen in vier oberbayerischen Landkreisen.[25] Das Department fÃƒÂ¼r Virologie der Medizinischen UniversitÃƒÂ¤t Wien fÃƒÂ¼hrt hingegen nur 50 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle in Bayern, 2 in Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg und 4 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle in Norwegen direkt auf diesen Ausbruch zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nur 21 der insgesamt 443 im Jahr 2008 gemeldeten Maserninfektionen in ÃƒÂ–sterreich waren nicht Teil des Salzburger Ausbruchs, sondern waren durch Reisen aus LÃƒÂ¤ndern wie der Schweiz, Deutschland, Spanien und Indien nach ÃƒÂ–sterreich importiert worden.[26], 74976=In Deutschland sind durch das 2001 in Kraft getretene Infektionsschutzgesetz Krankheitsverdacht, Erkrankung und Tod ebenso wie der direkte oder indirekte Nachweis des Masernvirus meldepflichtig geworden (Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â 6 IfSG). Leiter von Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen sind bei Kenntnis von ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤llen zur Meldung an das Gesundheitsamt verpflichtet.[61] Bei Krankheitsverdacht oder Erkrankung besteht TÃƒÂ¤tigkeits- und Aufenthaltsverbot in Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen. In ÃƒÂ–sterreich besteht Meldepflicht seit Dezember 1997 (BGBl. II Nr. 456/2001 Verordnung: Anzeigepflichtige ÃƒÂ¼bertragbare Krankheiten), in der Schweiz seit MÃƒÂ¤rz 1999 (Melde-Verordnung, SR 818.141.1)., 105691=Im 17. Jahrhundert war es das Verdienst Thomas Sydenhams, wÃƒÂ¤hrend einer groÃƒÂŸen Epidemie in London die Masern als eigenstÃƒÂ¤ndige Krankheit vom Scharlach und anderen fieberhaften ansteckenden Krankheiten abzugrenzen.[87] 1882 verÃƒÂ¶ffentlichte der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Arzt Antoine Louis Gustave BÃƒÂ©clÃƒÂ¨re seine Aufsehen erregende Arbeit Ã¢Â€ÂžDie Ansteckung mit MasernÃ¢Â€Âœ. Er und weitere franzÃƒÂ¶sische Kliniker erreichten, dass die Masern im 19. Jahrhundert endgÃƒÂ¼ltig als eigenstÃƒÂ¤ndige Krankheitseinheit gegenÃƒÂ¼ber den anderen Erkrankungen mit HautausschlÃƒÂ¤gen wie den RÃƒÂ¶teln abgegrenzt wurden., 86211=Nach dem Impfkalender der StÃƒÂ¤ndigen Impfkommission am Robert-Koch-Institut ist die erste MMR-Impfung bei allen Kindern zwischen dem vollendeten 11. und 14. Lebensmonat, die zweite im Alter von 15 bis 23Ã‚Â Monaten vorgesehen. Seit dem Sommer 2006 ist auÃƒÂŸerdem ein Kombinationsimpfstoff zugelassen, der zusÃƒÂ¤tzlich eine Windpockenkomponente enthÃƒÂ¤lt und damit den Impfplan weiter vereinfacht. Auch dieser Impfstoff wird zu denselben Zeiten zweimalig verabreicht.[69] Ã¢Â€ÂžEs ist dafÃƒÂ¼r Sorge zu tragen, dass die zweite MMR-Impfung so frÃƒÂ¼h wie mÃƒÂ¶glich, spÃƒÂ¤testens jedoch bis zum vollendeten 18. Lebensjahr nachgeholt wird; bei MÃƒÂ¤dchen wird damit auch der unverzichtbare Schutz vor einer RÃƒÂ¶telnembryopathie gesichert.Ã¢Â€Âœ[69] Im Jahr 2012 waren in Deutschland 92,4Ã‚Â Prozent der neu eingeschulten Kinder zweifach gegen Masern geimpft.[70], 64641=Die HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit der SSPE wurde frÃƒÂ¼her mit 5 bis 10 pro 1 Million MasernfÃƒÂ¤llen angegeben. Die neuere Literatur geht jedoch von einer HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit von etwa 1:1.000[56] bis 1:5.000 oder 1:10.000 Infizierten aus.[51][57] Die absolute HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit der SSPE ist durch die Masernimpfung seit den 1980er Jahren deutlich reduziert worden.}","Thu, 23 Jul 2015 21:25:12 GMT",Weltweite Situation[Bearbeiten] Epidemiologie[Bearbeiten] 11 Einzelnachweise 10 Weblinks 9 Literatur 8 Geschichte 7 Masern und Schwangerschaft 6.3 Postexpositionsprophylaxe 6.2.1 Impfreaktionen und -komplikationen 6.2 Impfung 6.1 QuarantÃƒÂ¤ne 6 Vorbeugung 5 Therapie 4.2 Meldepflicht 4.1 Differenzialdiagnose 4 Diagnose 3.3.4 Weitere Komplikationen 3.3.3 Subakute sklerosierende Panenzephalitis 3.3.2 Meningoenzephalitis 3.3.1 Masernpneumonie 3.3 Komplikationen 3.2 Untypische Verlaufsbilder 3.1 Symptome und Krankheitsverlauf 3 Krankheitsbild 2.2 ÃƒÂœbertragung und KÃƒÂ¶rperabwehr 2.1 Eigenschaften 2 Erreger 1.3 Amerika 1.2 Europa,"Das Masernvirus kommt weltweit vor, wobei die KrankheitshÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit stark variiert. Insbesondere in EntwicklungslÃƒÂ¤ndern kommt es immer wieder zu lokalen Masernepidemien mit hohen Krankheits- und Sterblichkeitszahlen.[4][5] Die Masern gehÃƒÂ¶ren dort zu den hÃƒÂ¤ufigsten Infektionskrankheiten. Laut SchÃƒÂ¤tzung der WHO haben sie im Jahr 2000 fast die HÃƒÂ¤lfte der 1,7Ã‚Â Millionen durch Impfung vermeidbaren TodesfÃƒÂ¤lle bei Kindern verursacht, bei geschÃƒÂ¤tzten 30 bis 40 Millionen KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤llen in jenem Jahr.[6] Die Zahl der gemeldeten Erkrankungen liegt aufgrund der hohen Dunkelziffer weit unter diesen geschÃƒÂ¤tzten Werten (siehe Tabelle). Auf der anderen Seite konnte das Virus durch groÃƒÂŸ angelegte Impfkampagnen in verschiedenen anderen Regionen, so dem gesamten amerikanischen Doppelkontinent, bereits weitgehend eliminiert werden, was dadurch mÃƒÂ¶glich ist, dass der Mensch der einzige Wirt des Masernvirus ist. 2001 legten die WHO und UNICEF einen Plan vor mit dem Ziel, die Sterblichkeitsrate bei Kindern durch weltweite Impfprogramme bis zum Jahr 2005 zu halbieren. WÃƒÂ¤hrend genaue Daten noch ausstehen, zeigen verschiedene Berichte, dass dieses Ziel zu einem groÃƒÂŸen Teil erreicht wurde. Von 1999 bis 2003 gelang eine weltweite Reduktion der Masern-Sterblichkeit um 39Ã‚Â %, wobei weiterhin hohe Sterblichkeitsraten in Afrika und SÃƒÂ¼dostasien bestehen.[7] 2005 adaptierte die World Health Assembly der WHO diese PlÃƒÂ¤ne und formulierte fÃƒÂ¼r das Jahr 2010 das Ziel einer 90-prozentigen Reduktion der weltweiten Sterblichkeit.[8] Dieses Ziel wurde laut WHO nicht erreicht.

WÃƒÂ¤hrend sie in einigen Regionen, wie den skandinavischen LÃƒÂ¤ndern, sehr niedrig ist Ã¢Â€Â“Ã‚Â in Finnland (wo eine Impfpflicht besteht)[13] traten seit 1996 lediglich vier importierte FÃƒÂ¤lle auf[14]Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“, ist das in Mittel- und Osteuropa oft noch nicht der Fall. Dort kommt es aufgrund von ImpflÃƒÂ¼cken immer wieder zu lokalen KrankheitsausbrÃƒÂ¼chen. Trotz Meldepflicht in den meisten LÃƒÂ¤ndern existiert wahrscheinlich eine hohe Dunkelziffer, und die Zahl der tatsÃƒÂ¤chlichen KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤lle liegt wesentlich hÃƒÂ¶her als die der gemeldeten. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) appellierte 2011 an die EU-Mitgliedstaaten, MaÃƒÂŸnahmen zur BekÃƒÂ¤mpfung der Masern zu verstÃƒÂ¤rken.[15], 87699=In ÃƒÂ–sterreich werden zwei Teilimpfungen im zweiten Lebensjahr mit einem Mindestabstand von einem Monat empfohlen. Wiederholungen der Impfung werden bei Schuleintritt im siebten Lebensjahr und im 13. Lebensjahr vom ÃƒÂ¶ffentlichen Gesundheitsdienst kostenlos angeboten.[71] Die Rate der Masernimpfung in ÃƒÂ–sterreich wurde fÃƒÂ¼r 2006 von der WHO auf 80Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Erst- und 61Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Zweitimpfung geschÃƒÂ¤tzt.[72], 16256=Im Jahr 2008 wurde vom U.S.-amerikanischen CDC auf einen Ausbruch von Masern in Israel hingewiesen, wo mehr als 900 FÃƒÂ¤lle bekanntgeworden sind, 700 davon in Jerusalem und Bet Schemesch.[10] In SÃƒÂ¼dafrika grassierte von 2009 bis 2011 eine Masernepidemie mit ÃƒÂ¼ber 18.000 gemeldeten FÃƒÂ¤llen (13.000 laborbestÃƒÂ¤tigt).[11] In Pakistan sind, nachdem bereits im Jahr 2012 ÃƒÂ¼ber 300 Maserntote gezÃƒÂ¤hlt wurden, bei einem im Dezember 2012 begonnen schweren Masernausbruch bis August 2013 ÃƒÂ¼ber 300 (meist) Kinder an der Krankheit gestorben.

Nach der Entdeckung Amerikas starb ein groÃƒÂŸer Teil der einheimischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung an den aus Europa importierten Krankheiten wie Masern, Pocken, Keuchhusten und Typhus. Der Grund dafÃƒÂ¼r war, dass die einheimischen Populationen keinerlei ImmunitÃƒÂ¤t gegen diese Erreger aufwiesen.[84] So kam es in Santo Domingo (1519), Guatemala (1523) und Mexiko (1531) zu verheerenden Masernepidemien. Im Jahre 1529 kam es zu einer sich ÃƒÂ¼ber Honduras und Mittelamerika ausbreitenden Masernepidemie, die zwei Drittel der ÃƒÂœberlebenden der zuvor ausgebrochenen Pockenepidemie das Leben kostete.[85], 27511=In den Niederlanden wird aufgrund einer orthodox-protestantischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerungsgruppe (Orthodox gereformeerde kerken), die aus religiÃƒÂ¶sen GrÃƒÂ¼nden eine Impfung ablehnt, ein epidemisches Auftreten der Masern in regelmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸigen AbstÃƒÂ¤nden beobachtet. 1999 kam es zu einem Ausbruch mit 2961 Erkrankungen und drei TodesfÃƒÂ¤llen, zwischen Mai 2013 und MÃƒÂ¤rz 2014 wurden ÃƒÂ¼ber 2600 Masernerkrankungen gemeldet, 182 wurden im Krankenhaus behandelt und ein Kind starb.[32], 88416=Die Empfehlungen des Bundesamtes fÃƒÂ¼r Gesundheit und der Schweizerischen Kommission fÃƒÂ¼r Impffragen sehen zwei MMR-Impfungen im Alter von 12 und 15Ã¢Â€Â“24 Monaten vor.[73] Die WHO schÃƒÂ¤tzt die Impfrate in der Schweiz fÃƒÂ¼r 2006 auf 86Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Erstimpfung und 70Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Zweitimpfung.[72], 22404=Zwischen Oktober 2014 und April 2015 kam es in Berlin zu mehr als 1000 Erkrankungen. WÃƒÂ¤hrend des FrÃƒÂ¼hjahrs 2015 lag die Anzahl der wÃƒÂ¶chentlichen Neuerkrankungen in Berlin, ThÃƒÂ¼ringen und Sachsen jeweils im mittleren zweistelligen Bereich.[20][21] Der Virusstamm war vermutlich durch Asylsuchende aus Bosnien und Herzegowina und Serbien, die auch als erste erkrankten, eingeschleppt worden. In Bosnien und Herzegowina grassierte bereits seit Februar 2014 eine grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸere Masern-Epidemie mit mehreren Tausend Betroffenen.[22] Die Daten im Epidemiologischen Bulletin fÃƒÂ¼r 2013 lassen vermuten, dass Masern in Deutschland bald wieder endemisch sein werden.[23], 30061=Bis 1994 fÃƒÂ¼hrten nahezu alle Staaten der UN-Region Amerika Impfprogramme fÃƒÂ¼r Kinder ein. Dadurch verringerte sich die durchschnittliche Zahl der Neuerkrankungen von 250.000 auf etwa 100 FÃƒÂ¤lle pro Jahr, die Masern gelten damit als faktisch ausgerottet. Regional treten noch vereinzelte KrankheitsausbrÃƒÂ¼che auf, die nahezu alle importiert sind oder auf importierte Masern zurÃƒÂ¼ckgefÃƒÂ¼hrt werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[8][35] Amerika ist somit ein Beispiel dafÃƒÂ¼r, dass die Masern durch Impfprogramme weltweit beherrscht werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[36], 28207=2002 kam es in der Region Kampanien im sÃƒÂ¼dlichen Italien zu einer weiteren lokalen Epidemie mit 1571 KrankheitsfÃƒÂ¤llen, von denen drei zum Tode fÃƒÂ¼hrten.[33] In RumÃƒÂ¤nien erkrankten 2005 ÃƒÂ¼ber 3600 Personen an den Masern, zehn Kinder starben daran., 106702=1911 gelang es erstmals, Affen mit Masern zu infizieren. 1927 entwickelte Rudolf Degkwitz die passive Masernschutzimpfung (Ã¢Â†Â‘Postexpositionsprophylaxe).[88] 1954 wurde das Virus von Enders und Peebles erstmals isoliert.[89] Dies fÃƒÂ¼hrte 1958 zur Entwicklung des ersten Impfstoffes, der ab 1963 allgemein erhÃƒÂ¤ltlich war., 95190=Weitere mÃƒÂ¶gliche Nebenwirkungen wurden immer wieder kontrovers diskutiert. Nach dem heutigen Kenntnisstand lÃƒÂ¶st die MMR-Impfung keine Erkrankungen wie Allergien, Asthma, Diabetes mellitus oder Morbus Crohn aus. 1998 postulierte der ehemalige[77] britische Chirurg Andrew Wakefield einen Zusammenhang zwischen der MMR-Impfung und dem Auftreten von Autismus. Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass Wakefield von AngehÃƒÂ¶rigen Autismus-Betroffener Geld erhalten hatte, und die VerÃƒÂ¶ffentlichung gilt als methodisch mangelhaft.

Unter Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen werden dabei Institutionen verstanden, in denen ÃƒÂ¼berwiegend SÃƒÂ¤uglinge, Kinder oder Jugendliche betreut werden, wie Kinderkrippen, KindergÃƒÂ¤rten, KindertagesstÃƒÂ¤tten, Kinderhorte, Schulen oder sonstige Ausbildungseinrichtungen, auÃƒÂŸerdem Heime und Ferienlager. Dieselbe Regelung gilt auch fÃƒÂ¼r die BeschÃƒÂ¤ftigten dieser Einrichtungen.[65] In anderen LÃƒÂ¤ndern bestehen vergleichbare Regelungen.

Daraufhin wurden 250 SchÃƒÂ¼ler fÃƒÂ¼r drei Wochen von der Schule ausgeschlossen.[30] Im Dezember 2010 bis Januar 2011 wurden in der Schweiz 31 FÃƒÂ¤lle an der Rudolf-Steiner-Schule in Basel gemeldet.[31], 20754=2005 kam es in Deutschland zu zwei grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸeren MasernausbrÃƒÂ¼chen, im Februar in Hessen mit einem Todesfall bei 223 ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤llen und im Mai in Oberbayern mit 110 Erkrankungen. 2006 wurden MasernhÃƒÂ¤ufungen in Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg sowie in Nordrhein-Westfalen gemeldet. Dies war die grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Masernepidemie seit EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Masern-Meldepflicht im Jahr 2001.[17] 2013 kam es in MÃƒÂ¼nchen zu einer Epidemie. Nach Angaben des dortigen Gesundheitsreferats wurden von April bis Anfang Juni 220 FÃƒÂ¤lle registriert, verglichen mit sieben im Vorjahr. ÃƒÂœber die HÃƒÂ¤lfte der Patienten musste in Kliniken behandelt werden, besonders hÃƒÂ¤ufig erkrankten Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene.[18] Eine SchÃƒÂ¼lerin brachte das Virus dann an eine Waldorfschule im Rhein-Erft-Kreis, wo es bei einer Impfquote von nur 25Ã‚Â % bei 400 SchÃƒÂ¼lern zu einem weiteren Masernausbruch im Juli 2013 kam. Es erkrankten 54 Menschen, davon 29 Jugendliche und Erwachsene. Drei Patienten mussten stationÃƒÂ¤r im Krankenhaus behandelt werden. Da auch der Impfschutz der Lehrer sehr niedrig war, musste die Schule fÃƒÂ¼r sechs Tage geschlossen werden.[19], 4708=Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) strebt die weltweite Ausrottung der Masern an.

Nord- und SÃƒÂ¼damerika sind Masern bis auf wenige importierte FÃƒÂ¤lle de facto bereits ausgerottet, dort wurden im Jahr 2014 weniger als 2000 FÃƒÂ¤lle bestÃƒÂ¤tigt.[1], 30931=Die Anzahl der Masernerkrankungen in den USA sank nach der EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung des Impfstoffes 1963 von ÃƒÂ¼ber 500.000 auf einige wenige FÃƒÂ¤lle im Jahr. Einen starken Anstieg der FÃƒÂ¤lle gab es jedoch von 1989 bis 1991. In diesen drei Jahren wurden ÃƒÂ¼ber 50.000 ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤lle berichtet, von denen 123 tÃƒÂ¶dlich endeten. HauptsÃƒÂ¤chlich waren Kleinkinder aus hispanoamerikanischen und afroamerikanischen Familien betroffen, bei denen die Rate ungeimpfter Kinder deutlich hÃƒÂ¶her war als bei der GesamtbevÃƒÂ¶lkerung. Mittlerweile treten genuine, also nicht importierte, Masernerkrankungen in den Staaten Nord- und SÃƒÂ¼damerikas mit Einschluss der Karibik kaum noch auf.[37] Die Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sehen die Masern in den USA nicht mehr als endemische Krankheit an.[8], 53000=ÃƒÂœber die Sterblichkeitsrate gibt es verschiedene Angaben. Das Robert-Koch-Institut nennt eine LetalitÃƒÂ¤t von 1:1000.[48] Die US-amerikanische CDC geht von einer Sterblichkeit von 1:500 bis 1:1000 aus.[49] Das Zentrum fÃƒÂ¼r PrÃƒÂ¤vention und Kontrolle von Krankheiten der EU berechnet eine Sterblichkeit von 3:1000.[50] In EntwicklungslÃƒÂ¤ndern liegt die Todesrate wesentlich hÃƒÂ¶her, teilweise bei bis zu 25Ã‚Â %.[8] LungenentzÃƒÂ¼ndungen sind die am hÃƒÂ¤ufigsten zum Tode fÃƒÂ¼hrenden Komplikationen., 96656=Obwohl die Impfung gegen Masern als notwendig und sicher gilt, wurde in einzelnen Publikationen kritisiert, dass die Studien zur Untersuchung der Nebenwirkungen der MMR-Impfung nicht ausfÃƒÂ¼hrlich genug und bezÃƒÂ¼glich des Studiendesigns teilweise inadÃƒÂ¤quat seien.[78] Dagegen hat Ende 2013 das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) alle vom 1. Januar 2001 bis 31. Dezember 2012 gemeldeten VerdachtsfÃƒÂ¤lle ausgewertet. Es konnte kein neues Risikosignal entdeckt werden, damit bleibt das PEI bei einer positiven Risiko-Nutzen-Bewertung der monovalenten und kombinierten Masernimpfstoffe.[81], 35549=Die WHO definiert 23 bisher bekannte Genotypen (Variationen der genetischen Informationen) in acht Gruppen (AÃ¢Â€Â“H).[39] Die Mutationsrate der Genome ist vergleichsweise gering, wodurch weltweite (geografische) Infektionswege nachvollzogen werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen.[40] In Mitteleuropa kommen vor allem die Genotypen C2, D6 und D7 vor. Die MasernausbrÃƒÂ¼che in der Schweiz und in Niederbayern 2006/2007 waren hingegen durch den aus Thailand oder Kambodscha stammenden Genotyp D5 verursacht.[41] Dies ermÃƒÂ¶glichte den Nachweis einer Infektkette von der Schweiz nach Niederbayern und von dort weiter nach ÃƒÂ–sterreich und Hannover, da der Genotyp D5 in Mitteleuropa sonst nur in EinzelfÃƒÂ¤llen auftritt. Weiterhin existiert nur ein stabiler Serotyp (Kombination von OberflÃƒÂ¤chenmerkmalen des Erregers), weshalb ein gut wirksamer Impfstoff hergestellt werden konnte., 23564=In ÃƒÂ–sterreich wurde vor der EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Masern-Meldepflicht 2001 vom Institut fÃƒÂ¼r Virologie (Wien) ein freiwilliges Meldesystem betrieben, das etwa 8Ã‚Â % der ÃƒÂ¶sterreichischen BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung abdeckte. Somit konnten fÃƒÂ¼r den Zeitraum von 1993 bis 1997 etwa 28.000 bis 30.000 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle fÃƒÂ¼r ganz ÃƒÂ–sterreich hochgerechnet werden, wobei besonders 1996 und 1997 ein gehÃƒÂ¤uftes Auftreten von Masernerkrankungen zu verzeichnen war. Die Zahl der jÃƒÂ¤hrlichen FÃƒÂ¤lle lag zwischen 2003 und 2007 jeweils unter 100 pro Jahr.[2] Ab MÃƒÂ¤rz 2008 breitete sich von einer Waldorfschule im Raum Salzburg eine Masernepidemie ÃƒÂ¼ber fast alle ÃƒÂ¶sterreichischen und zwei deutsche BundeslÃƒÂ¤nder aus. In Salzburg wurden 241 FÃƒÂ¤lle gemeldet, 146 in OberÃƒÂ¶sterreich, 22 in Wien, 13 in Tirol und 10 in Vorarlberg.[24] Im Zusammenhang mit dieser Epidemie erkrankten nach Auskunft bayerischer BehÃƒÂ¶rden zwischen Mitte MÃƒÂ¤rz und Mitte Juli 2008 auch insgesamt 217 Personen in vier oberbayerischen Landkreisen.[25] Das Department fÃƒÂ¼r Virologie der Medizinischen UniversitÃƒÂ¤t Wien fÃƒÂ¼hrt hingegen nur 50 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle in Bayern, 2 in Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg und 4 MasernfÃƒÂ¤lle in Norwegen direkt auf diesen Ausbruch zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nur 21 der insgesamt 443 im Jahr 2008 gemeldeten Maserninfektionen in ÃƒÂ–sterreich waren nicht Teil des Salzburger Ausbruchs, sondern waren durch Reisen aus LÃƒÂ¤ndern wie der Schweiz, Deutschland, Spanien und Indien nach ÃƒÂ–sterreich importiert worden.[26], 74976=In Deutschland sind durch das 2001 in Kraft getretene Infektionsschutzgesetz Krankheitsverdacht, Erkrankung und Tod ebenso wie der direkte oder indirekte Nachweis des Masernvirus meldepflichtig geworden (Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â 6 IfSG). Leiter von Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen sind bei Kenntnis von ErkrankungsfÃƒÂ¤llen zur Meldung an das Gesundheitsamt verpflichtet.[61] Bei Krankheitsverdacht oder Erkrankung besteht TÃƒÂ¤tigkeits- und Aufenthaltsverbot in Gemeinschaftseinrichtungen. In ÃƒÂ–sterreich besteht Meldepflicht seit Dezember 1997 (BGBl. II Nr. 456/2001 Verordnung: Anzeigepflichtige ÃƒÂ¼bertragbare Krankheiten), in der Schweiz seit MÃƒÂ¤rz 1999 (Melde-Verordnung, SR 818.141.1)., 105691=Im 17. Jahrhundert war es das Verdienst Thomas Sydenhams, wÃƒÂ¤hrend einer groÃƒÂŸen Epidemie in London die Masern als eigenstÃƒÂ¤ndige Krankheit vom Scharlach und anderen fieberhaften ansteckenden Krankheiten abzugrenzen.[87] 1882 verÃƒÂ¶ffentlichte der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Arzt Antoine Louis Gustave BÃƒÂ©clÃƒÂ¨re seine Aufsehen erregende Arbeit Ã¢Â€ÂžDie Ansteckung mit MasernÃ¢Â€Âœ. Er und weitere franzÃƒÂ¶sische Kliniker erreichten, dass die Masern im 19. Jahrhundert endgÃƒÂ¼ltig als eigenstÃƒÂ¤ndige Krankheitseinheit gegenÃƒÂ¼ber den anderen Erkrankungen mit HautausschlÃƒÂ¤gen wie den RÃƒÂ¶teln abgegrenzt wurden., 86211=Nach dem Impfkalender der StÃƒÂ¤ndigen Impfkommission am Robert-Koch-Institut ist die erste MMR-Impfung bei allen Kindern zwischen dem vollendeten 11. und 14. Lebensmonat, die zweite im Alter von 15 bis 23Ã‚Â Monaten vorgesehen. Seit dem Sommer 2006 ist auÃƒÂŸerdem ein Kombinationsimpfstoff zugelassen, der zusÃƒÂ¤tzlich eine Windpockenkomponente enthÃƒÂ¤lt und damit den Impfplan weiter vereinfacht. Auch dieser Impfstoff wird zu denselben Zeiten zweimalig verabreicht.[69] Ã¢Â€ÂžEs ist dafÃƒÂ¼r Sorge zu tragen, dass die zweite MMR-Impfung so frÃƒÂ¼h wie mÃƒÂ¶glich, spÃƒÂ¤testens jedoch bis zum vollendeten 18. Lebensjahr nachgeholt wird; bei MÃƒÂ¤dchen wird damit auch der unverzichtbare Schutz vor einer RÃƒÂ¶telnembryopathie gesichert.Ã¢Â€Âœ[69] Im Jahr 2012 waren in Deutschland 92,4Ã‚Â Prozent der neu eingeschulten Kinder zweifach gegen Masern geimpft.[70], 64641=Die HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit der SSPE wurde frÃƒÂ¼her mit 5 bis 10 pro 1 Million MasernfÃƒÂ¤llen angegeben. Die neuere Literatur geht jedoch von einer HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit von etwa 1:1.000[56] bis 1:5.000 oder 1:10.000 Infizierten aus.[51][57] Die absolute HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit der SSPE ist durch die Masernimpfung seit den 1980er Jahren deutlich reduziert worden.}","Thu, 23 Jul 2015 21:25:12 GMT","Impfreaktionen und -komplikationen[Bearbeiten] Die Ausrottung der Masern ohne Impfpflicht bleibt ein erklÃƒÂ¤rtes Ziel deutscher Gesundheitspolitik. Die Impfung schÃƒÂ¼tzt nicht nur den grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Teil der Geimpften, sondern durch die HerdenimmunitÃƒÂ¤t auch Neugeborene und SÃƒÂ¤uglinge vor der ersten Impfung, oder Impfversager und Immunsupprimierte, die nicht geimpft werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Eine wirksame Impfung schÃƒÂ¼tzt idealerweise nicht nur den Einzelnen, sondern hat auch eine soziale Dimension. Steht bei einem Kind die Aufnahme in eine Kindereinrichtung an, kann die MMR-Impfung auch vor dem zwÃƒÂ¶lften Lebensmonat, jedoch nicht vor dem neunten Lebensmonat erfolgen, da im ersten Lebensjahr im Blut des SÃƒÂ¤uglings noch vorhandene mÃƒÂ¼tterliche AntikÃƒÂ¶rper die Impfviren neutralisieren kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Auch wenn von Eltern oder Impflingen angegeben wird, dass eine Masern-, Mumps- oder RÃƒÂ¶telnerkrankung bereits durchgemacht wurde, wird die DurchfÃƒÂ¼hrung der MMR-Impfung empfohlen. Anamnestische Angaben ÃƒÂ¼ber eine Masern- oder RÃƒÂ¶telnerkrankung sind ohne mikrobiologisch-serologische Dokumentation der Erkrankungen unzuverlÃƒÂ¤ssig und nicht verwertbar. Eine serologische Untersuchung auf masernspezifische IgG-AntikÃƒÂ¶rper vor der zweiten Impfung und der Verzicht auf dieselbe bei ausreichendem Titer ist mÃƒÂ¶glich, alle aktuellen Impfempfehlungen sehen allerdings eine routinemÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige zweite Impfung ohne vorherige Diagnostik vor. Die Empfehlungen des Bundesamtes fÃƒÂ¼r Gesundheit und der Schweizerischen Kommission fÃƒÂ¼r Impffragen sehen zwei MMR-Impfungen im Alter von 12 und 15Ã¢Â€Â“24 Monaten vor.[73] Die WHO schÃƒÂ¤tzt die Impfrate in der Schweiz fÃƒÂ¼r 2006 auf 86Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Erstimpfung und 70Ã‚Â % fÃƒÂ¼r die Zweitimpfung.[72] In ÃƒÂ–sterreich werden zwei Teilimpfungen","Fieber, Abgeschlagenheit, Kopfschmerzen und lokale Impfreaktionen wie RÃƒÂ¶tung, Schmerzen und Schwellungen an der Injektionsstelle kÃƒÂ¶nnen wie bei allen Impfungen vorkommen und stellen harmlose Nebenwirkungen dar. Schwerwiegendere Impfkomplikationen wie ausgeprÃƒÂ¤gte allergische Reaktionen sind sehr selten. Bei der DurchfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Impfung sollte jedoch Personal und AusrÃƒÂ¼stung vorhanden sein, um auch eine solche Anaphylaxie behandeln zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Das Auftreten einer GehirnentzÃƒÂ¼ndung (Enzephalitis), oder Thrombozytopenie (Abfall der BlutplÃƒÂ¤ttchenzahl) ist extrem selten, der Zusammenhang der beobachteten FÃƒÂ¤lle mit der Impfung wird zudem kontrovers diskutiert.[63] Das Risiko des Auftretens von FieberkrÃƒÂ¤mpfen ist nach der Impfung leicht erhÃƒÂ¶ht, jedoch ohne langfristige SchÃƒÂ¤digungen.[76] Da es sich bei der Masernimpfung um eine Impfung mit einem abgeschwÃƒÂ¤chten Lebendimpfstoff handelt, kÃƒÂ¶nnen in 3Ã¢Â€Â“5Ã‚Â % der FÃƒÂ¤lle so genannte Impfmasern auftreten. Diese stellen eine milde Form der Masern dar und kÃƒÂ¶nnen die typischen Symptome zeigen, diese treten meistens in abgeschwÃƒÂ¤chter Form auf. Die Impfmasern sind nicht infektiÃƒÂ¶s.[51] Weitere mÃƒÂ¶gliche Nebenwirkungen wurden immer wieder kontrovers diskutiert. Nach dem heutigen Kenntnisstand lÃƒÂ¶st die MMR-Impfung keine Erkrankungen wie Allergien, Asthma, Diabetes mellitus oder Morbus Crohn aus. 1998 postulierte der ehemalige[77] britische Chirurg Andrew Wakefield einen Zusammenhang zwischen der MMR-Impfung und dem Auftreten von Autismus. Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass Wakefield von AngehÃƒÂ¶rigen Autismus-Betroffener Geld erhalten hatte, und die VerÃƒÂ¶ffentlichung gilt als methodisch",True,0,0

Many of the HBCUs were founded by states to satisfy the Second Morrill Act. These land grant schools continue to receive annual federal funding for their research, extension and outreach activities.

However, quite surprisingly their molecular-level structure is still not completely understood. In particular, there is evidence that the local intermolecular geometries depend significantly on the concentration. The aim of this study was to gain information on the molecular-level structures of water-ethanol mixtures by two computational methods. The methods are classical molecular dynamics (MD), where the movement of molecules can be studied, and x-ray Compton scattering, in which the scattering cross section is sensitive to the electron momentum density. Firstly, the water-ethanol mixtures were studied with MD simulations, with the mixture concentration ranging from 0 to 100%. For the simulations well-established force fields were used for the water and ethanol molecules (TIP4P and OPLS-AA, respectively). Moreover, two models were used for ethanol, rigid and non-rigid. In the rigid model the intramolecular bond lengths are fixed, whereas in the non-rigid model the lengths are determined by harmonic potentials. Secondly, mixtures with three different concentrations employing both ethanol models were studied by calculating the experimentally observable x-ray quantity, the Compton profile. In the MD simulations a slight underestimation in the density was observed as compared to experiment. Furthermore, a positive excess of hydrogen bonding with water molecules and a negative one with ethanol was quantified. Also, the mixture was found more structured when the ethanol concentration was higher. Negligible differences in the results were found between the two ethanol models. In contrast, in the Compton scattering results a notable difference between the ethanol models was observed. For the rigid model the Compton profiles were similar for all the concentrations, but for the non-rigid model they were distinct. This leads to two possibilities of how the mixing occurs. Either the mixing is similar in all concentrations (as suggested by the rigid model) or the mixing changes for different concentrations (as suggested by the non-rigid model). Either way, this study shows that the choice of the force field is essential in the microscopic structure formation in the MD simulations. When the sources of uncertainty in the calculated Compton profiles were analyzed, it was found that more statistics needs to be collected to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the final results. The obtained Compton scattering results can be considered somewhat preliminary, but clearly indicative of the behaviour of the water-ethanol mixtures when the force field is modified. The next step is to collect more statistics and compare the results with experimental data to decide which ethanol model describes the mixture better. This way, valuable information on the microscopic structure of water-ethanol mixtures can be found. In addition, information on the force fields in the MD simulations and on the ability of the MD simulations to reproduce the microscopic structure of binary liquids is obtained.', 'Vesi-etanoliseoksia kÃƒÂ¤ytetÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n hyvin yleisesti sekÃƒÂ¤ teollisuudessa ettÃƒÂ¤ kotitalouksissa. Siksi on ehkÃƒÂ¤ hieman yllÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤, ettÃƒÂ¤ niiden mikroskooppinen, molekyylitason rakenne ei ole vielÃƒÂ¤kÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n tÃƒÂ¤ydellisesti tunnettu. Tutkimuksissa on erityisesti tullut ilmi, ettÃƒÂ¤ paikalliset molekyylitason rakenteet riippuisivat seossuhteesta. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on pyrkiÃƒÂ¤ saamaan lisÃƒÂ¤tietoa vesi-etanoliseosten molekyylitason rakenteesta kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤en kahta eri laskennallista menetelmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤. Valitut menetelmÃƒÂ¤t ovat klassinen molekyylidynamiikka (MD), jonka avulla voidaan tutkia molekyylien liikettÃƒÂ¤, sekÃƒÂ¤ Compton-sironta, jossa sironnan vaikutusala riippuu elektronien liikemÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤rÃƒÂ¤tiheydestÃƒÂ¤. TehdyissÃƒÂ¤ MD-simulaatioissa alkoholipitoisuudet olivat vÃƒÂ¤lillÃƒÂ¤ 0-100%. Vesimolekyylille ja etanolimolekyylille kÃƒÂ¤ytettiin niille yleisesti hyvÃƒÂ¤ksi osoittautuneita vuorovaikutusmalleja (TIP4P ja OPLS-AA). LisÃƒÂ¤ksi simulaatioissa kÃƒÂ¤ytettiin etanolin sidoksille kahta eri mallia, jÃƒÂ¤ykkÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ ja joustavaa. JÃƒÂ¤ykÃƒÂ¤ssÃƒÂ¤ mallissa molekyylien sisÃƒÂ¤iset sidospituudet ovat rajoitettuja, kun taas joustavassa mallissa sidospituudet mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ritetÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n harmonisella potentiaalilla. Kokeellisesti saatava suure, Compton-profiili, laskettiin kolmelle eri konsentraatiolle kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤en sekÃƒÂ¤ jÃƒÂ¤ykkÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ ettÃƒÂ¤ joustavaa etanolia. Simulaatiot tuottivat hieman aliarvioidun tiheyden verrattuna kokeellisiin tuloksiin. LisÃƒÂ¤ksi sekÃƒÂ¤ vesi- ettÃƒÂ¤ etanolimolekyylien solmimien vetysidosten mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤rÃƒÂ¤ poikkesi ideaalitapauksesta siten, ettÃƒÂ¤ sidoksia muodostui enemmÃƒÂ¤n veden kuin etanolin kanssa. Tutkimuksessa huomattiin myÃƒÂ¶s, ettÃƒÂ¤ seoksella oli jÃƒÂ¤rjestyneempi rakenne, kun etanolipitoisuus oli suurempi. Ero etanolimallien vÃƒÂ¤lillÃƒÂ¤ oli merkityksetÃƒÂ¶n MD-simulaatioissa. Compton-sirontalaskut sen sijaan tuottivat selkeÃƒÂ¤n eron eri etanolimallien vÃƒÂ¤lille. JÃƒÂ¤ykÃƒÂ¤lle etanolille Compton-erotusprofiilit olivat kaikille etanolipitoisuuksille samat, mutta joustavalle etanolille ne erosivat toisistaan. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n perusteella sekoittumisprosessille on kaksi vaihtoehtoa. Vesi-etanoliseokset sekoittuvat samalla tavalla kaikilla konsentraatioilla (jÃƒÂ¤ykÃƒÂ¤n mallin tapaus) tai sekoittuminen muuttuu eri konsentraatioilla (joustavan mallin tapaus). TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ tutkimus osoittaakin, ettÃƒÂ¤ vuorovaikutusmallin valinnalla on merkittÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤ vaikutus MD-simulaatioista saatavan mikroskooppisen rakenteen muodostumiseen. Kun Compton-profiilien laskennan tarkkuuteen vaikuttavia lÃƒÂ¤hteitÃƒÂ¤ arvoitiin, huomattiin, ettÃƒÂ¤ laskuissa kÃƒÂ¤ytettÃƒÂ¤vien MD-simulaatioista saatavien paikallisten rakenteiden otosmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤rÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ on lisÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤, jotta tilastollinen virhe lopputuloksissa pienenisi. TÃƒÂ¤ssÃƒÂ¤ tutkimuksessa esitettyjÃƒÂ¤ Compton-sirontatuloksia voidaankin pitÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ jossain mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤rin alustavina, mutta kuitenkin selkeÃƒÂ¤sti suuntaa-antavina tuloksina vesi-etanoliseosten kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤ytymisestÃƒÂ¤, kun vuorovaikutusmallia muutetaan. Tulevaisuudessa tutkimusta voidaan jatkaa lisÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤llÃƒÂ¤ nÃƒÂ¤ytteiden mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤rÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ ja vertaamalla tuloksia kokeellisiin mittauksiin, jolloin voidaan pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤, kumpi etanolimalleista kuvaa seosta paremmin. Siten on mahdollista saada merkittÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ tietoa vesi-etanoliseosten mikroskooppisen tason rakenteesta. Sen lisÃƒÂ¤ksi tietoa saadaan MD-simulaatioiden vuorovaikutusmallien valinnasta ja siitÃƒÂ¤, onko MD-simulaatiolla mahdollista luoda oikeita mikroskooppisia rakenteita kaksikomponenttinesteille.', 'en', 'Helsingin yliopisto', 'Helsingfors universitet', 'University of Helsinki', 'Julkaisu on tekijÃƒÂ¤noikeussÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤nnÃƒÂ¶sten alainen.

Cavalier Coach Mike London said """"Andrew is a dynamic player on the defensive side, and he's the No. 1 defensive tackle in the country. I know that his ability, his accomplishments, his work ethic, I mean there's so many different things about him that he brings to the table that makes your football team a better team."", 12521=Mihota was Virginia Tech's first commitment from the Class of 2014. ""Virginia Tech kind of really made me seem like I was a priority,"" he said. ""They wanted me to come here and the offer was good, they really valued me here and so I accepted it,"" Mihota said. One of the first things that stands out about the powerhouse Massaponax product is his strength on the inside. He doesn't necessarily have the best wheels or moves to the outside, but tackles/tight ends simply cannot block this guy when he gets inside of them. Numerous plays on his junior tape are because of his quick first step at the snap. (something that should help him a ton at VT) Once Mihota gets inside of a blocker, he uses powerful strength to continue to use his positioning to break free. He is perfect for the Hokies' 4-3 scheme which sees backside defensive ends making tackles on cutback running plays., 1097=When Da'Shawn Hand committed to Alabama in November during a televised ceremony at his school, it was the first time the Crimson Tide had landed the nation's top rated recruit in the Rivals era. Hand was on a mission at the Under Armour All-America Game. Hand was mostly dominant on the practice field and turned in a very strong game. His strength surprised many of the offensive linemen and coaches throughout the week. Hand even took some snaps at defensive tackle for Team Nitro during the game. Hand's pass rushing techniques were extremely advanced and he played with such great leverage that many of the offensive linemen weren't able to move him off of his spot., 5494=Nnadi is the No. 4 ranked player in Virginia for the 2014 class and the No. 2 ranked defensive tackle. Virginia Tech and Florida State are the frontrunners but the Rivals100 defensive tackle from Virginia Beach (Va.) Ocean Lakes took an official visit to Virginia last weekend and Ohio State and Penn State are still in the game. Nnadi took all five of his official visits and he liked the visits to Blacksburg and Tallahassee the most. The official visit to Charlottesville was good as well, but Nnadi has changed his mind a lot throughout the recruiting process, so this should be very close coming down to Wednesday's decision., 10020=he big man ended his recruiting on the first day of May by accepting the offer from Florida State committing to the 'Noles program in the early evening. ""I knew it was where I wanted to go as soon as I left my visit,"" said Eberle. ""It's the best place and I know we have the best chance to win a championship."" The Seminoles have slotted him to play center., 21375=GO DEEP! Check out the Class of 2014 Extensive Prospect Listing!, 1793=GO DEEP! Check out the Class of 2014 Extensive Prospect Listing!

Though there is no other sure- thing besides Anthony Davis, the consensus number one pick, in this draft, many consider this a fairly deep draft class. Cleveland will still get a productive player in either Kentucky's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kansas' Thomas Robinson or North Carolina's Harrison Barnes to pair with reigning Rookie of the Year Kyrie Irving. Cleveland also owns the 24th pick in the first round and the third and fourth picks in the second round of this year's draft., 14989=Cleveland Cavaliers tickets ensure that fans see the Cavs playing top contenders throughout the entire NBA season. The Cavaliers will look to improve their standing in the Central Division in 2011. With matchups against great teams like the Indianna Pacers and Chicago Bulls and non-divisional meetings with John Wall's Washington Wizards, the Cavs are sure to be tested all season long. Grab your Cavaliers tickets now and don't miss the action!, 11458=The Cleveland Cavaliers dropped their final game of the 2012 campaign with a 107-75 loss to the Chicago Bulls. Even with the Bulls resting Derrick Rose, Luol Deng and Kyle Korver before the playoffs, the Bulls handily beat a struggling Cavaliers franchise who will look to have a big offseason to address a growing list of needs for the team. Tristan Thompson led the offensive attack for the Cavs with 13 points, 12 rebounds, one steal and a block in the loss. Antawn Jamison scored 12 points in what could be his last game in a Cleveland uniform. He will become a free agent once the playoffs are over., 12656=With a 19-37 record heading into mid-April, the Cleveland Cavaliers must begin to look to the future to find a way to compete over the next couple of years. Rookie Kyrie Irving has provided a nice spark for the franchise in averaging 18.8 points in his first season, but unfortunately it hasn't been enough to get the team over the hump. Antwan Jamison has also played well, averaging 17.9 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, however the team is still ranked 22nd overall in points per game and have also allowed 99.8 points per game on defense, one of the worst marks in the league., 13317=Cleveland Cavaliers tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's proudest franchises. Founded in 1970, the Cavs are still working towards their first NBA championship after making it to the finals in 2007. The Cavs play their games at Quicken Loans Arena and have called the venue home since it opened in 1994. Watch as the Cavs build their legacy and work to bring their first world title to Cleveland!, 13770=Now that the LeBron James era of the Cavs has ended, the team has spent a substantial amount of time rebuilding and reorganizing the franchise. The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach Mike Brown in the 2010 offseason along with a majority of their coaching staff. Assisant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to General Manager when former General Manager resigned in June 2010. So far, there has been a dramatic shift from the two previous seasons. The Cleveland Cavaliers were the conference worst with 19 wins and 63 losses. Durign the season, the Cavs also had a 26-game losing streak which tied the NBA record for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport., 12080=With a paltry 21-43 record, the Cleveland Cavaliers will look to put the 2012 season behind as quickly as possible. Rookie Kyrie Irving has been the lone bright spot for Cleveland this year, averaging 18.8 points per game through his first NBA season. The team will look to the upcoming NBA draft to address a laundry list of needs, and with such a poor record thus far, they have a good chance of receiving a high pick in the lottery.

Though there is no other sure- thing besides Anthony Davis, the consensus number one pick, in this draft, many consider this a fairly deep draft class. Cleveland will still get a productive player in either Kentucky's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kansas' Thomas Robinson or North Carolina's Harrison Barnes to pair with reigning Rookie of the Year Kyrie Irving. Cleveland also owns the 24th pick in the first round and the third and fourth picks in the second round of this year's draft., 14989=Cleveland Cavaliers tickets ensure that fans see the Cavs playing top contenders throughout the entire NBA season. The Cavaliers will look to improve their standing in the Central Division in 2011. With matchups against great teams like the Indianna Pacers and Chicago Bulls and non-divisional meetings with John Wall's Washington Wizards, the Cavs are sure to be tested all season long. Grab your Cavaliers tickets now and don't miss the action!, 11458=The Cleveland Cavaliers dropped their final game of the 2012 campaign with a 107-75 loss to the Chicago Bulls. Even with the Bulls resting Derrick Rose, Luol Deng and Kyle Korver before the playoffs, the Bulls handily beat a struggling Cavaliers franchise who will look to have a big offseason to address a growing list of needs for the team. Tristan Thompson led the offensive attack for the Cavs with 13 points, 12 rebounds, one steal and a block in the loss. Antawn Jamison scored 12 points in what could be his last game in a Cleveland uniform. He will become a free agent once the playoffs are over., 12656=With a 19-37 record heading into mid-April, the Cleveland Cavaliers must begin to look to the future to find a way to compete over the next couple of years. Rookie Kyrie Irving has provided a nice spark for the franchise in averaging 18.8 points in his first season, but unfortunately it hasn't been enough to get the team over the hump. Antwan Jamison has also played well, averaging 17.9 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, however the team is still ranked 22nd overall in points per game and have also allowed 99.8 points per game on defense, one of the worst marks in the league., 13317=Cleveland Cavaliers tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's proudest franchises. Founded in 1970, the Cavs are still working towards their first NBA championship after making it to the finals in 2007. The Cavs play their games at Quicken Loans Arena and have called the venue home since it opened in 1994. Watch as the Cavs build their legacy and work to bring their first world title to Cleveland!, 13770=Now that the LeBron James era of the Cavs has ended, the team has spent a substantial amount of time rebuilding and reorganizing the franchise. The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach Mike Brown in the 2010 offseason along with a majority of their coaching staff. Assisant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to General Manager when former General Manager resigned in June 2010. So far, there has been a dramatic shift from the two previous seasons. The Cleveland Cavaliers were the conference worst with 19 wins and 63 losses. Durign the season, the Cavs also had a 26-game losing streak which tied the NBA record for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport., 12080=With a paltry 21-43 record, the Cleveland Cavaliers will look to put the 2012 season behind as quickly as possible. Rookie Kyrie Irving has been the lone bright spot for Cleveland this year, averaging 18.8 points per game through his first NBA season. The team will look to the upcoming NBA draft to address a laundry list of needs, and with such a poor record thus far, they have a good chance of receiving a high pick in the lottery. In terms of the rest of this season, the team's remaining games come against the Washington Wizards and the Chicago Bulls.}",,"Scores and Schedule If you haven't already, click the Track Them button above.

Because their backs were put to the wall weeks ago with respect to even qualifying for the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Red Wings have been in playoff do-or-die mode for longer than most teams and will post a significant challenge to their round one opponent, the Anaheim Ducks. Despite their midseason streak, the Ducks have been trailing behind the Chicago Blackhawks for the entire season but ahead of their division rival the Los Angeles Kings, so Anaheim hasn't had the same kind of daily intensity. Therefore, the Red Wings could be poised to do far more than just show up for the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs; they could make a significant run, starting with the disposal of the Ducks., 14878=1/28/15: Detroit went into the All Star break with a head of steam, having won five straight. That is tied with Anaheim and Winnipeg for the longest active winning streaks in the NHL. The strong push has put them into second place in the Atlantic Division with 63 points. They trail the Tampa Bay Lighting by one point (but have a game in hand) and Montreal by two points (who have two games in hand on Detroit). In other news, the NHL announced that the Red Wings would be in a Stadium Series outdoor game next season. They will visit the Colorado Avalanche at Coors Field on February 27, 2016., 335=The Red Wings went 2-1 versus the Anaheim Ducks in the 2013 NHL season and both wins came on the road. The Wings are hoping to get out to a hot start on the road and then improve their performance at home in the Joe Louis Arena., 10367=11/5/14: Putting the standings and on-ice play to the side for a few minutes to wish Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe well. Howe, who played for Detroit from 1947-71, suffered a stroke last week and is recuperating. He was Wayne Gretzky before Wayne Gretzky, and, in fact, Gretzky's famous number 99 was a tribute to Howe who wore number 9. The Red Wings faithful gave him a warm ovation last week, which puts everything into perspective. Here is hoping that Mr. Hockey makes a full recovery and is back soon. The Red Wings have a couple great home games this week against the Devils (Friday) and the Lightning (Sunday), 7138=10/1/14: The Red Wings are getting prepared to start the regular season in search of some redemption. Detroit kept their long-standing streak of making the playoffs alive in the 2013-14 season, but it was a short trip to the postseason. This year should be different as the injuries have healed (though there may be some new ones). On top of that, the team broke ground on a new arena/entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The new digs are expected to open in for the 2017-18 season and will replace the antiquated Joe Louis Arena, which opened in 1979., 7796=10/8/14: There is no denying that the 2013-14 season was a down year for the Red Wings. They managed to make the playoffs, again, but simply did not have the firepower to do any real damage due to a lot of injuries. One player they need to get back, if they are going to improve this season, is forward Pavel Datsyuk. The good news is that Datsyuk is practicing with the team again. The bad news is that he is not ready to play a real game yet. He is recovering from a separated shoulder, and unlike the movies, is not fully repaired by popping back into place. Consider him doubtful to start the season, but he should be ready soon enough., 4703=6/20/13: The Red Wings announced that they are going to get a new arena. Their new home will take a couple years to build, and will be located near Ford Field and Comerica Park - home of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers, respectively. It is expected to cost $650 million, and the hope is that a unified downtown sports area will continue to revived the area. The Red Wings have played in Joe Lewis Arena since 1979. It is the third oldest arena in the league, behind Madison Square Garden (major renovation) and Nassau Coliseum (which the Islanders are abandoning in 2015).}","{1551=NHL Playoffs - Atlantic Division One of the most interesting aspects of the NHL realignment that preceded the 2013-14 regular season was the decision to move the Detroit Red Wings into the Eastern Conference.

Because their backs were put to the wall weeks ago with respect to even qualifying for the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Red Wings have been in playoff do-or-die mode for longer than most teams and will post a significant challenge to their round one opponent, the Anaheim Ducks. Despite their midseason streak, the Ducks have been trailing behind the Chicago Blackhawks for the entire season but ahead of their division rival the Los Angeles Kings, so Anaheim hasn't had the same kind of daily intensity. Therefore, the Red Wings could be poised to do far more than just show up for the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs; they could make a significant run, starting with the disposal of the Ducks., 14878=1/28/15: Detroit went into the All Star break with a head of steam, having won five straight. That is tied with Anaheim and Winnipeg for the longest active winning streaks in the NHL. The strong push has put them into second place in the Atlantic Division with 63 points. They trail the Tampa Bay Lighting by one point (but have a game in hand) and Montreal by two points (who have two games in hand on Detroit). In other news, the NHL announced that the Red Wings would be in a Stadium Series outdoor game next season. They will visit the Colorado Avalanche at Coors Field on February 27, 2016., 335=The Red Wings went 2-1 versus the Anaheim Ducks in the 2013 NHL season and both wins came on the road. The Wings are hoping to get out to a hot start on the road and then improve their performance at home in the Joe Louis Arena., 10367=11/5/14: Putting the standings and on-ice play to the side for a few minutes to wish Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe well. Howe, who played for Detroit from 1947-71, suffered a stroke last week and is recuperating. He was Wayne Gretzky before Wayne Gretzky, and, in fact, Gretzky's famous number 99 was a tribute to Howe who wore number 9. The Red Wings faithful gave him a warm ovation last week, which puts everything into perspective. Here is hoping that Mr. Hockey makes a full recovery and is back soon. The Red Wings have a couple great home games this week against the Devils (Friday) and the Lightning (Sunday), 7138=10/1/14: The Red Wings are getting prepared to start the regular season in search of some redemption. Detroit kept their long-standing streak of making the playoffs alive in the 2013-14 season, but it was a short trip to the postseason. This year should be different as the injuries have healed (though there may be some new ones). On top of that, the team broke ground on a new arena/entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The new digs are expected to open in for the 2017-18 season and will replace the antiquated Joe Louis Arena, which opened in 1979., 7796=10/8/14: There is no denying that the 2013-14 season was a down year for the Red Wings. They managed to make the playoffs, again, but simply did not have the firepower to do any real damage due to a lot of injuries. One player they need to get back, if they are going to improve this season, is forward Pavel Datsyuk. The good news is that Datsyuk is practicing with the team again. The bad news is that he is not ready to play a real game yet. He is recovering from a separated shoulder, and unlike the movies, is not fully repaired by popping back into place. Consider him doubtful to start the season, but he should be ready soon enough., 4703=6/20/13: The Red Wings announced that they are going to get a new arena. Their new home will take a couple years to build, and will be located near Ford Field and Comerica Park - home of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers, respectively. It is expected to cost $650 million, and the hope is that a unified downtown sports area will continue to revived the area. The Red Wings have played in Joe Lewis Arena since 1979. It is the third oldest arena in the league, behind Madison Square Garden (major renovation) and Nassau Coliseum (which the Islanders are abandoning in 2015).}","{1551=NHL Playoffs - Atlantic Division One of the most interesting aspects of the NHL realignment that preceded the 2013-14 regular season was the decision to move the Detroit Red Wings into the Eastern Conference.

On paper everything is fine: I have a Core 2 Duo processor, and when I check my EFI in Terminal with ""ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi"", it returns EFI64 (not EFI32). Nonetheless, my model is incapable of running the 64-bit kernel (again, 64-bit apps run just fine in the 32-bit environment). As I understand it, it's an artificial limitation that Apple placed on the MacBook 4,1. It's quite stupid that my 2008 model has this artificial limitation, while the iMac 7,1 from 2007 apparently boots to the 64-bit kernel by default in Lion. That's the way it is., 27689=The ONLY Intel Mac that can't run 64bit code is the original Core Duo MacBook Pro. All subsequent machines are at least Core2 which can run 64bit code. The CPU should be the only thing that determines what code you can run, and sure enough you can run plenty of 64bit apps. However, Apple installed a 32bit build of EFI on their Macs for several years and only switched to 64bit EFI relatively recently. That 64bit EFI is needed to run the kernel in 64bit mode as the bootloader lacks the ability to switch modes and launch a 64bit kernel from a 32bit environment. A little shim can be used during the boot to fix this. Before going to that trouble though, its worth testing what happens if you set the flag since even some machines with a 64bit EFI (like my 2008 MacBook Pro) still boot the kernel in 32bit mode by default. All that aside, it really doesn't matter if kernel is in 32 or 64bit mode to anything but a kext (drivers). All apps can execute in either regardless of which mode the kernel is in, so long as all dependent libraries are in the correct bitness for the app. AFAIK, macports will build x86_64 apps and libs as long as the CPU is capable, unless your macports.conf is changed or you set +universal. So, to make long story short, your machine isn't too old to run 64bit and most likely your entire macports collection is being built for 64bit, including gavl., 24633=A little more info for those who might care to hack up the configure script. Line 3106 sets the host_cpu variable to the results of a routine called from config.sub. That should be the cpu id of the buildhost, which should just be result of uname -m, except this is autotools trash so a few thousands lines of shell script are executed to cone up with the same answer (or in this case, NOT the same answer). That host_cpu variable is used on line 11555 to set the architecture, where i[3-7]86 sets ARCH_X86=true, and x86_64 also sets ARCH_X86_64=true. That latter variable makes a significant difference, setting it cleans up some errors that were coming from configure right around where it shows the detected architecture. As the host_cpu variable is used in numerous other places, I decided to override it as its the base of the problem, rather than just set the flag here and risk other problems. With the override on line 3106, I get detected architecture x86_64 (correct) instead of previous IA32 (incorrect) and the build and cleanly finish.}",,gavl fails to build with llvm-gcc-4.2 Last modified 3 years ago Opened 4 years ago Ticket #30488 (closed defect: fixed) Next Ticket Ã¢Â†Â’ Ã¢Â†?

The swimming is a crucial event in giving our athletes a competitive advantage and with that in mind Pentathlon GB is pleased to announce sponsorship from elite swimwear brand blueseventy. blueseventy, a New Zealand brand, has 30 years of experience in all areas of swimming, from open water and triathlon, to elite pool swimming. This experience has allowed blueseventy to become market leaders in competition swimwear and world-class athletes rely on them time and time again to help them swim faster, whatever their discipline. Their pledge of support for the Pentathlon GB Podium and Podium Potential squads with competition and training swimwear is therefore an enormous boost to the team. Ã¢\x80\x9cModern Pentathlon is a great blend of the traditional and the cutting edge and we are very excited to be supporting some of BritainÃ¢\x80\x99s finest athletes within Pentathlon GB. We are sure that our nero race suits can become part of their ritual and give them another performance edgeÃ¢\x80?, said Rebecca Jenkins from blueseventy, whose UK base is in Bath. The news has come just at the right time for the team with the European Championships held at Pentathlon GBÃ¢\x80\x99s national training base at the University of Bath on 18-23 August 2015, providing eight direct qualification places for the Rio 2016 Olympics. The competitive advantage the blueseventy kit could provide will be a crucial factor in deciding these qualification places, with the first opportunity starting in June at the World Cup Final. Ã¢\x80\x9cThis blueseventy sponsorship is another step on our journey to the Olympics in Rio in just 18 months. For the athletes to know they are supported by such a quality swim brand that boasts the latest technology in performance swimwear, will give them great confidence. The timing couldnÃ¢\x80\x99t be better, ahead of so many crucial events this season and Rio qualifying competitions loomingÃ¢\x80?, said Nigel Laughton, Chief Executive Officer of Pentathlon GB. Ã¢\x80\x9cGreat swimming times are vital to our athletes and having blueseventy on board for the next two years is a significant boostÃ¢\x80?. The partnership with blueseventy, agreed by Laughton, will last until the end of December 2016, seeing the team through two competitive seasons, including the Olympic year.

Reigning World Champion Samantha Murray Ã¢\x80\x93 who struck gold at the opening World Cup in Sarasota, US Ã¢\x80\x93 also returns to a womenÃ¢\x80\x99s team which features Kate French and Frejya Prentice, who have both won bronze medals this season. Woodbridge Ã¢\x80\x93 who competed at the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympic Games Ã¢\x80\x93 has struggled with hip problems during the past couple of years and last appeared at a World Cup in Chengdu, China, in April 2013. However, he is working his way back to full fitness and made his first competitive appearance of 2015 at the Budapest Cup in Hungary earlier this month. Woodbridge is joined in the Pentathlon GB menÃ¢\x80\x99s team for Rome by Tom Toolis, Joe Choong and Joe Evans, who is making his third World Cup appearance of the season. That record is matched in the womenÃ¢\x80\x99s team by Prentice, who finished a fine third at the Cairo World Cup earlier this month. Making their second World Cup appearances will be Murray and French, both of whom were on the podium in Sarasota, and Joanna Muir, who was victorious at the Swiss Women's International last week. Pentathlon GB Performance Director Jan Bartu believes his team will face their strongest competition of the year so far in Rome.

Ã¢\x80\x9cThe medal was fantastic yesterday and we should not be disappointed with the men today given the circumstancesÃ¢\x80?, he said. Freyja Prentice took bronze in the womenÃ¢\x80\x99s individual event despite horse problems and was backed by a fantastic debut performance from Francesca Summers who finished 14th. Today Joe Evans came home 15th overall and Jamie Cooke, a World Cup winner a month ago in the USA, was 32nd. Both were battling a stomach virus as well as the opposition. Ã¢\x80\x9cThese things happen and itÃ¢\x80\x99s not an excuse. ThatÃ¢\x80\x99s just the way it isÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu. Joe Evans looked on track to lay down his best World Cup performance since early 2013 when he started the final event Ã¢\x80\x93 the combined run-shoot Ã¢\x80\x93 in sixth place. Earlier, like Cooke, he fenced reasonably well and then clocked the second fastest swim of the day and added a flawless ride to set him up for the combined. Ã¢\x80\x9cThatÃ¢\x80\x99s when you could see that he didn'tÃ¢\x80\x99 have anything left, thatÃ¢\x80\x99s where it had its effectÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu who watched as Evans dropped back to 16th overall. Cooke laboured hard to the end but also dropped places during the combined from 21st to 30th place. He struggled, too, on the swim posting an unusually slow time of 2:07.51. Home favourite Omar El Geziry was first going into the run-shoot but was overhauled by LatviaÃ¢\x80\x99s Ruslan Nakonechnyi who was in fantastic form on the range. He went on to take gold with the Czech RepublicÃ¢\x80\x99s Jan Kuf in silver. Yesterday, Freyja Prentice, became the third British woman to stand on a World Cup podium this season so far, underlining the GB squadÃ¢\x80\x99s strength in depth. She took bronze, in an event won by Olympic Champion Laura Askadauskaite, to add to the gold and bronze medals won by Samantha Murray and Kate French respectively a month ago. Prentice, who finished with 1323 points, battled hard to move up from seventh to take a medal in a thrilling finish to the combined run-shoot event. Ã¢\x80\x9cFreyja has been a long time in waiting for a performance like thisÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu. Ã¢\x80\x9cShe started well in the fencing which is important for her as her swimming is not her strongest eventÃ¢\x80?. Drama then struck as the horse drawn by Prentice was eliminated in the first round after a few fences when ridden by another rider. Bartu and Prentice had to make a choice whether to risk riding it or asking for the reserve choice. They settled for the latter and, with under 20 minutes to get to know her new mount, PrenticeÃ¢\x80\x99s flawless ride was all the more remarkable. Ã¢\x80\x9cI think that gave her the confidence she needed going into the last event to get a medalÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu. Ã¢\x80\x9cFrancesca also deserves big credit for the way in which she performed, being in the situation of competing at a World Cup for the first time in her life. It was fantastic to see and so good for the womenÃ¢\x80\x99s group as another athlete is now there and lining upÃ¢\x80?.

Prentice, who finished with 1323 points, battled hard to move up from seventh to take a medal in a thrilling finish to the combined run-shoot event. Earlier Prentice had performed strongly in the fencing competition to record 21 wins and 232 pentathlon points but could only finish 26th fastest in the swim with a time of 2:25.31. She put herself back in contention with full points (300) on the ride to leave her in seventh place going into the combined event with a 48 second margin behind American Margaux Isaksen. Isaksen, who took silver last month in the USA, was leading until the very last shooting stage today when she struggled to hit the targets in a tense climax to the all-day event. The American was overhauled on the range by Laura Asadauskaite of Lithuania who ran on to victory, overturning IsaksenÃ¢\x80\x99s 31 second advantage at the start of the combined event. Prentice came back through the field and moved into bronze just before that final stage. Francesca Summers, making her senior world cup debut for Britain after taking Youth Olympic Games bronze last year, was seventh in the fencing, 19th in the swim and 20th in the ride. That put her in 10th place, 56 seconds behind the leader, going into the final event before ultimately finishing 14th overall with 1274 points.

Cooke, from Cheltenham and the winner of the first World Cup of 2015 in the USA last month, recorded 19 wins in the fencing and was second fastest in the swim to give himself a good margin going into the combined run-shoot. His final total of 1151 was just a point ahead of World Champion Aleksander Lesun of Russia. In group C, Joe Evans was seventh going into the combined event after posting one of his groupÃ¢\x80\x99s faster swim times. He went on to claim third spot, and a qualifying place for the final, with 1134 points, after a first-class combined event.

SKINS, the global market leader in sports compression, has pledged to support the elite squad and the sportÃ¢\x80\x99s young and emerging stars with training and competition garments. SKINS pioneering garments apply compression to specific body parts in a balanced and accurate way to accelerate blood flow to deliver more oxygen to working muscles. The improved blood flow also helps remove lactic acid and other metabolic waste. Playing a big part in recovery, the improved oxygenation reduces the effects of delayed onset muscle soreness and accelerates muscle repair. The news comes on the day the seasonÃ¢\x80\x99s second World Cup starts in Cairo and as a boost to the University of Bath based squad who are poised to challenge for Rio 2016 Olympic qualifying places from June onwards. Ã¢\x80\x9cItÃ¢\x80\x99s an important year for us with Rio in mind. We want to qualify a full quota of men and women for next yearÃ¢\x80\x99s Games and having the right kit will give us a feel-good factor as well as performance edge in the coming monthsÃ¢\x80?, said Nigel Laughton, the organisationÃ¢\x80\x99s Chief Executive Officer. He has struck a deal which will last until the end of December 2016 that will allow Pentathlon GB athletes access to SKINSÃ¢\x80\x99 new A400 range for training and competition, as well as their revolutionary RY400 range for recovery purposes too. Ã¢\x80\x9cModern Pentathlon is one of the nationÃ¢\x80\x99s most successful sports squadsÃ¢\x80?, said David Ling, SKINS UK General Manager. Ã¢\x80\x9cWe\'re delighted to have joined forces with Nigel and the team to supply them with a product that will scientifically support their busy training and competition schedule. WeÃ¢\x80\x99re confident that the partnership will be mutually beneficial as we both strive for excellence."" Whilst the Rio qualifying process begins at the World Cup final in June, the home European Championships from 18-23 August is one of the more significant opportunities for GB athletes to secure quota places for the nation. Eight will be on offer there. The GB squad is hoping for a big home crowd to boost them. Kate French, winner of World Cup bronze earlier this month, said: Ã¢\x80\x9cThe European Championships are a great opportunity to bring another major competition to Great Britain where the crowd will be able to fully support the GB athletes. Ã¢\x80\x9cSpending so much time training in Bath it would be amazing to have the opportunity to gain an Olympic qualification place here in Bath. Hopefully having the \'feeling at home\' will give that extra advantageÃ¢\x80?. Tickets for the Europeans will be priced from Ã‚Â£6 to Ã‚Â£21 with all under-18s welcome for Ã‚Â£1 per day. There will be options to try individual sports during breaks in the action and an Ã¢\x80\x9cevent villageÃ¢\x80? of stands and displays to add to the big-event experience. Ã¢\x80\x9cIt is not every day that live Olympic sport is on the doorstep, so we are hoping that local people will join those coming from around the country to cheer our athletes on. This is a crucial event on the road to Rio for the GB pentathletes as well as being an exciting spectacleÃ¢\x80?, said Event Director Kara Luck.

The Championships, one of the earliest opportunities the GB athletes have to qualify for Rio 2016, are set to take place 18 Ã¢\x80\x93 23 August 2015 in Bath. London 2012 silver medallist Samantha Murray and recent World Cup winner Jamie Cooke look set to vie for one of the eight Olympic qualifying slots on offer at the Championships which will take place on a compact site at the University of Bath. Over 100 athletes from across Europe are expected to attend to challenge for the titles in this four event, five discipline sport which is at the heart of Olympic tradition. Pentathletes compete in fencing, swimming, horse riding and a combined run and shoot event, all in one day, in a challenge of skills and endurance. During the Championships in Bath there will be individual and team events across six days of action. Bath is a focus for the sport in the UK as the top pentathletes live in the city and train every day in the National Training Centre at the University of BathÃ¢\x80\x99s Ã‚Â£30 million Sports Training Village.

Ã¢\x80\x9cModern Pentathletes, many of whom also study at the University, are incredibly high-achieving athletes because of the number of disciplines they need to train towards every day. Theirs is a fascinating sport to watch and this event will rekindle all the excitement of London 2012Ã¢\x80?, he added. GB Performance Director Jan Bartu also knows the advantage that a home venue can bring and, for him, the event in August is something quite special. Ã¢\x80\x9cI have been working here in Bath since 1998, before the Sports Training Village was built, and it has always been my dream to stage a big event here where we train every day. It is quite magical for me and my coaching team to finally realise this ambitionÃ¢\x80?. Recent world cup gold winner and former World Junior Champion Jamie Cooke said: Ã¢\x80\x9c Competing on home soil is always fun, to have the crowd there backing you the whole way. What makes it even more special is having the Europeans in our city, which I'm sure will bring an added advantage. Ã¢\x80\x9cHaving friends and family supporting and watching makes competing even more special. With this being one of the first chances of qualifying for Rio I'm sure the competition will be fierce, I think we are all looking forward to the challengeÃ¢\x80?. Samantha Murray, London 2012 Olympic silver medallist, said she was excited by the prospect of competing in an Olympic qualifier at her home training base. Ã¢\x80\x9cIt will be a fantastic opportunity for our sport to harness the interest generated by the 2012 Olympics and by the performance of the British men and women there.Ã¢\x80? Ã¢\x80\x9cFrom my experience in London I know it will be a fabulous occasion for British athletes to compete on home soil in front of friends, families and supporters, and thatÃ¢\x80\x99s always an advantage,Ã¢\x80? she added.

Samantha Murray, who also took gold, in a historic Pentathlon GB double, is rested for this round.

Frejya Prentice, who made her debut on the World Cup circuit in 2009, will compete alongside teenager Francesca Summers. Ã¢\x80\x9cEvery World Cup is important to us and for the athletes attending as we get closer and closer to Olympic qualifyingÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu of a process for Rio which begins in June at the World Cup final and during which the home Europeans in Bath this August will be a significant milestone. Bartu is also making use of two other international competitions as the overall training group prepares for that Olympic build-up.

The medal tally was a first in recent history for GB. Ã¢\x80\x9cI canÃ¢\x80\x99t remember us doing this beforeÃ¢\x80?, said Jan Bartu, PentathlonGB Performance Director since 1998. Ã¢\x80\x9cIt is a first to win both individual golds. We are all over the moon and itÃ¢\x80\x99s fantasticÃ¢\x80?. CookeÃ¢\x80\x99s triumph came today as a result of a series of consistent performances across the four events Ã¢\x80\x93 fencing, swimming, riding and then the combined event (run-shoot). Bartu singled out his fencing for particular praise. Ã¢\x80\x9cJamie put in one of his best fencing competitions ever and that set him up. That was a major, major breakthrough for himÃ¢\x80?, he said. In the final event of the day Cooke clinched victory by overhauling EgyptÃ¢\x80\x99s 2014 World Silver Medallist Amro El Geziry after the second of four shooting stages. The Egyptian had started with a four second advantage. Cooke, from Cheltenham, then held onto his lead ahead of RussiaÃ¢\x80\x99s Egor Puchkarevskiy despite a nervous final shooting stage. Earlier former World Junior Champion Cooke, with 20 fencing wins, went into the riding competition in third place overall, Choong was fifth and Evans 15th at this stage. All three British men produced some sizzling swim times. Cooke was the fastest in 1:59.21 and the GB trio were all within three tenths of each other. Only El Geziry, leading after two events, swam faster. He also secured 23 fencing wins. Puchkarevskiy was lying second and ChinaÃ¢\x80\x99s Guo Jianli was in fourth. Cooke, on a horse called Montey Carlo, put his faith in a controlled and measured ride with the risk of going over the time limit. His gamble paid off as he went clear and only recorded four time faults. Ã¢\x80\x9cHe rode very wellÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu. Ã¢\x80\x9cHe was composed and technically solidÃ¢\x80?. By contrast Joseph Choong had earlier lost his balance coming into fence nine, putting all his weight to one side and was unseated at fence ten. He was disqualified but later permitted to start the run-shoot five minutes behind the leaders. Ã¢\x80\x9cIt was a pity for Joe as he had earlier fenced well and his is a good swimmerÃ¢\x80?, said Bartu. Joe Evans recovered from a poor fencing competition to swim well. He moved up from 28th after the fencing to 14th going into the ride during which he had only one fence down, leaving him in ninth place for the combined run-shoot but eventually slipped back outside the top ten. Ã¢\x80\x9cIt was a good experience for JoeÃ¢\x80?, explained Bartu. Ã¢\x80\x9cHe was fatigued towards the end of such a big competitionÃ¢\x80?. The menÃ¢\x80\x99s results followed a dream first world cup performance for GBÃ¢\x80\x99s women with Samantha Murray, the reigning World Champion, taking gold and Kate French, the bronze. Ã¢\x80\x9cThese results far exceeded our expectationsÃ¢\x80?, said Performance Director Jan Bartu.

Murray held off a strong challenge from home favourite Margaux Isaksen in the final to win gold. She had a buffer going into the final combined event (the run-shoot) and needed it to keep Isaksen at bay. French, meanwhile, made up a significant deficit in the combined to post a time of 13:15.82 and take the bronze. RussiaÃ¢\x80\x99s Donata Rimsaite was the quickest in 13:05.48 but could not close the gap and took fourth. Murray had gone into the combined event in pole position. She had a five second advantage over her nearest challenger. Home favourite Margaux Isaksen had led after the swim and the fence but then knocked down three fences to MurrayÃ¢\x80\x99s one in the 12-fence riding competition. From the top group only Frenchwoman Elodie Clouvel went clear in this event. Kate French, seventh going into the ride, toppled a pole at fence three as well as a fence in the treble. Earlier Freyja Prentice and Joanna Muir both showed their technical riding ability on equally challenging mounts. Murray built a good early platform in the competition with 20 wins in the fencing round-robin before posting the dayÃ¢\x80\x99s second fastest 200m swim time of 2:09.84. French recorded 21 wins in the fencing but was much slower in the swim with 2:20.26. Coupled with her riding points it meant that the British no.1 started 31 seconds down on Murray in the combined. Joanna Muir was 22nd after the first three events whilst Freyja Prentice was in 28th. Prentice made up ten places to take 18th overall and Muir finished her debut World Cup in 29th. A fairytale start to the season for the British squad came just a day after they had announced a new sponsor in legal firm Mogers Drewett.

Muir, from Dumfries, will join Olympic silver medallist and reigning World Champion Samantha Murray for the event which starts on Wednesday 18th and runs to Saturday 21st February in Sarasota, Florida. Muir is studying Sports Performance at the University of Bath, which is also home to Pentathlon GBÃ¢\x80\x99s National Training Centre. Freyja Prentice, from Inverurie near Aberdeen, and Kate French, from Meopham in Kent, both winners of the World Championships relay silver last year with LancashireÃ¢\x80\x99s Murray, complete the womenÃ¢\x80\x99s line up. The menÃ¢\x80\x99s team consists of ShropshireÃ¢\x80\x99s Joe Evans, who topped the British rankings list after Pentathlon GBÃ¢\x80\x99s recent series of three ranking competitions, Jamie Cooke, from Cheltenham, Joe Choong, from Orpington and Tom Toolis, from Hornchurch. Choong, from Orpington, is a Mathematics student at the University of Bath and is a recipient of the Ivor Powell Sports Scholarship Fund which provides scholarships for students who are gifted both academically and in their chosen sport. He began to show his prowess with World Youth silver in 2013 and silver at the Milan Kalec Memorial in Prague in April of 2014. Toolis, and a Sport and Exercise student at the University of Bath, won the European menÃ¢\x80\x99s relay bronze in Hungary last year. GB Performance Director Jan Bartu is delighted to have been able to select his top-ranked athletes into a strong team to start the season. He said: Ã¢\x80\x9cEveryone was fit and healthy so we went with the top-ranked athletes based on our recent eventsÃ¢\x80?. For Bartu, just as for the athletes, there will be a sense of stepping into the unknown in Sarasota. He explained: Ã¢\x80\x9cEveryone, athletes included, would say that the first competition of the season can be a little bit weird. It is essentially a long time since anyone has stepped into that bubble of the big event. Only comparison with the opposition allows you to see the bigger picture.Ã¢\x80? Ã¢\x80\x9cWe think the overall entry will be strong, though, as many nations have already been training in advance of the World Cup at a training camp in Colorado SpringsÃ¢\x80?. The women will contest semi-finals on Wednesday 18th February and finals on Friday 20th February. The men will compete in their semi-finals on Thursday 19th February and in the finals on Saturday 21st February. Pentathlon GB has not entered the mixed relay. Competition each day will start at 08.00 local time (13:00 in the UK) and the finals will conclude at approx 17.00 in the US (22:00 in the UK).

The first of the Olympic quota qualifying chances for 2015 will be the World Cup Final in June in Minsk but the European Championships, taking place in Bath in August, will be amongst the more key opportunities with eight quota places on offer there.
