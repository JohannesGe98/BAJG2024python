Ici il perd un pot Ãƒ\xa0 un million de jetons. Et non 1 million de dollards. On peut trÃƒÂ¨s bien finir deuxieme du tounois en ayant 1 jeton tout le long, survivre et gagner 1 million d'euros alors qu'on a jamais eu plus d'un jeton durant toute la partie. C'est trÃƒÂ¨s diffÃƒÂ©rent du cash game. Vu les sommes en jeu, je pense que cela c'est passÃƒÂ© durant le main event des WSOP. Le coÃƒÂ»t de l'inscription est de 10.000$ Il termine 371e apres cette main, et remporte 28.000$. Donc un bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©fice net de 18.000$ Cependant, si il gagne ce coup, il est surement bien placÃƒÂ©. Probablement top 100 et est donc bien parti pour durer un jour supplÃƒÂ©mentaire, ou il peut espÃƒÂ©rer remporter plus. POur info celui qui gagne ce tournois remporte 6 millions de $ Ãƒ\xa0 peu prÃƒÂªt. Je l'ai dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 jouÃƒÂ©, mais j'ai fini 2000eme donc j'ai rien gagnÃƒÂ©, il y a environ 650 places payÃƒÂ©es, mais un pote Ãƒ\xa0 moi Ãƒ\xa0 fini 47eme et a pris 152.000$ Mode je raconte ma vie off Par contre, le coup est standard et sans intÃƒÂªret pour quelqu'un de confirmÃƒÂ© a ce jeu. Le mec en face Ãƒ\xa0 une chance sur 15 de toucher sa dame, c'est pas exceptionnel non plus. Et puis vu le rapport tapis/taille du pot, il est logique que les deux joueurs finissent Ãƒ\xa0 tapis sur ce turn. Si je simplifie grossiÃƒÂ¨rement les calculs, il y a 900.000 a prendre pour le joueur avec AQ pour une mise Ãƒ\xa0 suivre de 300.000. Donc il n'a besoin de remporter ce coup qu'une fois sur 4. si il perd 3 fois 300.000 il perd 900.000 pour 900.000 a gagner. ET avec top paire avec un kicker Q ici, il aura toujours 25% de chances de gagner Ãƒ\xa0 long terme. Coup standard de la part des deux joueurs. Petite correction Ãƒ\xa0 faire aussi, on appelle cette carte une 'dame' et non une reine au poker. Edit : A mon VDDessous, ce fÃƒÂ»t mon mÃƒÂ©tier pendant quelques annÃƒÂ©es. Je jouais surtout sur internet, mais j'ai un peu jouÃƒÂ© en casinos, notemment Ãƒ\xa0 Las Vegas, j'ai fait championnat, du monde, d'europe...

Il y a dans le pot dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 243\'000 dollars appartenant aux autres joueurs et Ãƒ\xa0 lui et Paredes des tours prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dents. Il a un double paire ce qui est plus fort qu\'une paire. Les deux ont un As donc les deux ont une paire trÃƒÂ¨s ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e et de valeur ÃƒÂ©gale. C\'est donc la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me paire qui fera la diffÃƒÂ©rence. Si Paredes obtient une dame au River (derniÃƒÂ¨re carte retournÃƒÂ©e par le dealer), il a donc une double paire de valeur plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e que Gill. La probabilitÃƒÂ© est nÃƒÂ©anmoins trÃƒÂ¨s faible car il y a dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 des dames qui sont sorties, n\'importe quelle autre carte aurait fait l\'affaire pour Gill. Il insiste pour que Paredes le suive (et donc mette en jeu l\'ÃƒÂ©quivalent du tapis de Gill, soit 372\'000 aussi). Cela fait donc 243\'000 de pot, + 2x 372\'000, pour un pot total de 987\'000 qui va au vainqueur du tour. AprÃƒÂ¨s avoir insistÃƒÂ© longuement auprÃƒÂ¨s de Paredes en rÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ©tant ""tout ce dont tu as besoin, c\'est une dame"" pour le pousser Ãƒ\xa0 le suivre et mettre les probabilitÃƒÂ©s d\'encaisser 987\'000, Paredes craque et le suit, un peu follement, en se disant qu\'il a sa chance et ne sachant pas forcÃƒÂ©ment si Gill bluffait. RÃƒÂ©sultat, le dealer sort une dame au River et sort Gill, qui, aprÃƒÂ¨s avoir insistÃƒÂ©, sÃƒÂ»r de gagner, auprÃƒÂ¨s de Paredes se voit expulsÃƒÂ© avec un ""maigre"" butin (argent rÃƒÂ©el).

Et puis depuis peu le poker n'est plus considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© comme un jeu de hasard si on en tire des revenus rÃƒÂ©guliers, et les taxations sont vraiment importantes. pas mal de mes amis qui ÃƒÂ©taient professionnels ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© contraint d'arrÃƒÂªter car les taxes mangeaient tous leurs bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©fices. Ajoute Ãƒ\xa0 cela, tous les frais de dÃƒÂ©placement, hotel, avion, bouffe. Stress, car il est normal de perdre de l'argent sur de longues pÃƒÂ©riodes en jouant parfaitement. De plus tu ne cotises pas pour ta retraite, tu n'as pas de congÃƒÂ©s payÃƒÂ©s et pas de sÃƒÂ©cu, et puis va retrouver un travail si sur ton CV tu as une pause de 5ans... j'ai prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© arrÃƒÂªtÃƒÂ© car je me suis dit dans 5ans, si ÃƒÂ§a marche plus, je fais quoi? Faut dire aussi que je ne gagnais pas des fortunes. Je tournais Ãƒ\xa0 environ 12Ã‚\x80 de l'heure sans cotisations, ni retraites, ni vacances... donc finalement, il vaut mieux faire comme tout le monde et aller travailler! C'est vraiment plus sÃƒÂ»r. De plus mÃƒÂªme les joueurs sponsorisÃƒÂ©s n'ont pas de salaire. En fait leurs sponsorts leurs payent certains tournois. Donc si il ne font pas de performances, ils ont jouÃƒÂ© sans que cela ne leur coÃƒÂ»te d'argent, mais en contrepartie ils ne gagnent rien non plus. Parcontre, en cas de gains, tout va dans leur poche. @diabolebo : Ca tournais gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralement a 6 millions la premiere place il y a quelques annÃƒÂ©es il me semble, mÃƒÂªme si depuis quelques annÃƒÂ©es on approche des 9 millions pour le premier rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨rement Cette annÃƒÂ©e : 1er: 8,359 millions de dollars 2e: 5,173 millions de dollars 3e: 3,727 millions de dollars 4e: 2,791 millions de dollars Et duhamel en 2010 a prit 8.944.310$ Je suis pas hyper au point niveau tournois, j'ÃƒÂ©tais avant tout un joueur de cash game. MÃƒÂªme si j'ai pu participer Ãƒ\xa0 de beaux tournois. @Quenellier : En tournois, quand les joueurs sont Ãƒ\xa0 tapis, on rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©le les mains avant que le coup soit terminÃƒÂ©. Ici cela part Ãƒ\xa0 tapis au turn, donc les joueurs voient tous les mains avant que la denriÃƒÂ¨re carte commune (la river) ne soit distribuÃƒÂ©e. En cash game, par contre, tu n'es pas obligÃƒÂ© de rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ© ta main tout de suite. Tu peux attendre que la river ait ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© distribuÃƒÂ©e. C'est une petite diffÃƒÂ©rence de rÃƒÂ¨gle qui n'influe pas sur le jeu, mais qui fait monter la pression et qui est surtout utile pour voir les changements d'expression du visage Ãƒ\xa0 la camÃƒÂ©ra @diablolebo : Tu es ce qu'on appelle dans le jargon 'result oriented' ton raisonnement est influencÃƒÂ© par le fait que tu vois les cartes de chacun des joueurs. Dans l'absolu je comprend ce que tu penses, mais penses bien que ces joueurs ont un historique de jeu en commun, ils peuvent ÃƒÂªtre Ãƒ\xa0 la mÃƒÂªme table depuis plusieurs jours. Si effectivement l'adversaire ÃƒÂ©tait sur un tirage couleur, il n'aurait que 18% de chances de toucher sa couleur Ãƒ\xa0 la river. soit une chance sur 5. Ce serait plutÃƒÂ´t un bon scÃƒÂ©nario avec Top paire 2nd kicker ont aurait alors 82% de chances de l'emporter. En fait sa dÃƒÂ©cision est simplifiÃƒÂ©e du fait de la taille du pot. comme j'ai expliquÃƒÂ© grossiÃƒÂ¨rement sur mon prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dent message, il risque 300.000 pour en gagner 900.000 soit il n'a besoin de l'emporter q'une fois sur 4. Ici il n'a que 7% de chances, donc son call semble mauvais, mais l'adversaire aura parfois AJ auquel car il aurais 93% de chances de gagner, ce cerait inversÃƒÂ©. C'est difficile d'ÃƒÂ©valuer le jeu adverse car on ne voit pas le dÃƒÂ©but du coup nÃƒÂ©anmoins Ãƒ\xa0 long terme il aura gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralement plus que les 25% requis ici, donc le call est facile avec AQ.

NÃƒÂ©anmoins 2 choses . D'abord tu parles d'une chance sur 44 . C'est mal calculÃƒÂ© . Le joueur connait 6 cartes sur 52 . Il reste donc non pas 44 mais 46 cartes inconnues . Avec 3 outs . Soit 1 chance sur 15,33 de tirer sa dame . Si tu ne tiens en compte que les cartes restant dans le deck, tu oublies les cartes des 8 autres joueurs et les 2 cartes brulÃƒÂ©s . Ca fait plus que 26 cartes dans le paquet . On voit que le raisonnement ne tient pas . Ensuite c'est vrai que pour honnÃƒÂ¨tement parler de bon ou mauvais call, il faudrait voir la main depuis le dÃƒÂ©but . Qui a call prÃƒÂ© flop, qui a suivi le flop, combien de joueur ... etc Tu dis aussi que je base mon raisonnement sur le fait que je connais les cartes adverse . Justement non, je le base sur comment j'aurai jouÃƒÂ© ce jeu . Sans rentrer dans les % (tu t'y connais clairement mieux que moi, y'a pas de doute), j'ai AQ avec top pair, l'adversaire me relance tapis .

L'adversaire touche ses 2 paires, vraissemblablement A/10, main rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨rement jouÃƒÂ©e en tournoi, moins en cash game . Je suis baisÃƒÂ© Ãƒ\xa0 moins de touchÃƒÂ© ma Q (3 outs) L'adversaire cherche son tirage couleur . 2 coeurs, 2 piques sur le tapis . 9 outs pour l'adversaire (j'enlÃƒÂ¨ve les Q) . 3 outs pour moi .

Vu qu'il a un petit tapis son adversaire ne peux payer qu'avec des grosses mains. Avec des mains du type 78s cela lui couterait trop chÃƒÂ¨re pour peu Ãƒ\xa0 gagner pour aller chercher un tirage au flop. Au premier jours cela aurait ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© correct mais pas au 4eme jours ou les blindes sont trop chÃƒÂ¨res pour se permettre de jouer des coups avec des petits tapis effectifs. Du coup son le mec Ãƒ\xa0 capuche a soit une paire servie du genre 88+, soit un As bien kickÃƒÂ© du genre AJ+, soit un KQ quelque chose comme ca. Si le joueur a capuche est serrÃƒÂ© agressif, il l'aurait surrelancer avant le flop avec JJ+, AK, il ne lui reste donc que 88-99,TT et AJ KQ et AQ (qu'il peut surrelancer avant le flop Ãƒ\xa0 l'occasion). Un fois le turn on sait que KQ il aurait passÃƒÂ© car il n'aurait pas la cote pour chercher un tirage ventrale ne lui apportant que 10% de chances de gagner alors que payer demande 25%, donc on enleve KQ dans son ÃƒÂ©ventail de main Il n'a pas 88 ni 99, il aurait dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 passÃƒÂ©, car se sont des mains trop faible ici car l'agresseur aura souvent un As, on peut donc enlever ces mains. Avec TT il aurait un brelan, et aurait donc payÃƒÂ© instantannÃƒÂ©ment, ÃƒÂ§a nous enlÃƒÂ¨ve encore une main On peu donc dÃƒÂ©duire que le joueur a soit AJ soit AQ, ce sont les seules mains qui demande un peu de rÃƒÂ©flection, quoi que, pour moi c'est un call facile, mais aprÃƒÂ¨s c'est le 4ÃƒÂ¨me jours du ME donc pas si facile... Comme il sait que son advresaire a AJ ou AQ, il a donc une chance sur deux de se tromper en disant qu'il lui faut une Q. C'est un coup qui parait impressionnat quand on te l'annonce de but en blanc, mais en fait ÃƒÂ§a rentre tout seul avec l'expÃƒÂ©rience. Certains coups sont tellement standard que les joueurs expÃƒÂ©rimentÃƒÂ©s peuvent rÃƒÂ©duire les possibilitÃƒÂ©s de mains adverses Ãƒ\xa0 seulement deux ou trois dans certaines situations. Dans d'autres situations l'adversaire aura tellement de mains possible dans son arsenal qu'il sera plus difficile de donner un jeu prÃƒÂ©cis. Edit @diablolebo: Je parlais du point de vue du spectateur. Nous connaissons 8 cartes il en reste 44, effectivement cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© joueur il reste 46 cartes inconnues. Tu as raison souvent on sera dominÃƒÂ© par un meilleur kicker. On est plus souvent battu quand on call, parcontre, de temps en temps on bat AJ, voir un As+tirage couleur on est lÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ¨rement favori au turn, alors qu'au flop nous sommes perdant. Par contre, si il joueur Ãƒ\xa0 9 out pour gagner, cela signifie qu'il en a 35 qui ne le font pas gagner. Donc que notre main est dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 gagnante et n'a pas besoin de s'amÃƒÂ©liorer. Dans l'absolu en payant ici on va perdre plus souvent qu'on va gagner, lÃƒ\xa0 dessus tu as tout Ãƒ\xa0 fait raison. Si il misait plus chÃƒÂ¨re il faudrait se coucher. Cependant, son tapis ne reprÃƒÂ©sente qu'un risque de 300k pour en gagner 900k, c'est ce qui prime et nous permet de payer avec le jeu qui ne sera pas toujours favori, mais qui gagnera suffisamment souvent pour nous rapporte un gros pot quand on gagne, et perdre une petite mise quand on perd. Si on se couche l'argent dÃƒÂ©jÃƒ\xa0 investi est perdu. C'est assez ÃƒÂ©trange, mais parfois la taille du pot nous permet de payer avec un jeu qui n'est pas favori.

The clubs will begin Sept. 4 and run every Tuesday from 3:45-5:15 p.m., through Nov. 27. Angelique Harshman and Beth Cortright will teach the clubs. PEECÃ¢Â€Â™s Nature Clubs are a way to help children connect with the outdoors. Members will investigate local animals and plants and connect with the wildÃ‚Â side of the Pajarito Plateau through a variety of activities.Ã‚Â Because the clubs are targeted to just two grade levels each, activities will be more age-appropriate than before. Club members hike in the canyon, do science experiments and get in-depth with nature. Harshman is an environmental educator with more than 15 years of experience working with kids from preschool to high school age. Cortright is a biologist with a specialty in entomology and has worked with many PEEC programs, including field trips and summer camps.

Advancement usually consists of assuming greater responsibility. Administrative Assistants may advance to become Assistant Administrator, Associate Administrator, and Administrator.

The folk dance line dance is literally a line of dancers, holding hands with each other in one of four ways. One is hands held down, in the ""V"" position. Another is hands held bent at the elbow, in the ""W"" position. There are front basket holds and back basket holds that are like belt holds but instead of holding on to your neighborÃ¢Â€Â™s belt, you hold hands with the person that is next to your neighbor. Another dance hold is the shoulder hold, done in many Greek and Macedonian dances. Then there is the belt hold. Bring an extra belt to wear around your waist. (We have extras if you forget yours.) Adjacent dancers grab your belt and you grab your neighbors. Your right arm over their left arm, (depending on the direction of travel.)

No previous experience necessary! Dances are usually taught by local teachers, while guest instructors teach at workshops from time to time throughout the year. What Will It Mean For Me? It will mean new friends, good exercise and a challenge for feet and mind alike. It could mean travel to workshops in other cities or countries. It could mean a new interest in music or costume. It will mean an introduction to a whole network of dance. International folk dancing provides the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. Sites like The American Cancer Society provide empirical evidence for the benefits of dancing. Clinical reports suggest that dance therapy helps in developing body image; improving self-concept and self-esteem; reducing stress, anxiety, and depression; decreasing isolation, chronic pain, and body tension; and increasing communication skills and feelings of well being. Some of the physical motions of dance therapy can be useful exercise that provides the health benefits produced by exercise. Physical activity is known to increase special neurotransmitter substances in the brain (endorphins) which create a state of well being. And total body movement enhances the functions of other body systems, such as the circulatory, respiratory, skeletal, and muscular systems. Regular aerobic exercise helps with glucose metabolism, cardiovascular fitness, and weight control. If dance or movement therapy is used in this way, it can confer the same benefits as other types of exercise. Moderate",True,2,0,,"{764=Next folk dance Saturday, August 1st}"

Our Two Cents The Alter Ego Pants offer the same design philosophy as the Alter Ego jacket designs, to offer protection and comfort for a wide range of riding temperatures and conditions. I really like the overall design of these pants. And while they are a bit more in price than less adaptable designs (such as solid textiles or all-mesh pants), they will be more comfortable for a wide range of riding situations. If you tour in the mountains for example, you might see temperature ranges from the 40s to the 80s all in one day. And since storage space on a bike is always at a premium it would be handy only to pack one pair of pants to cover all the riding situations. These pants have a zip-off panel that opens up a large mesh vented area from just over each knee, all the way around the back of the pants to the other knee (take the Ã¢Â€ÂœView Larger PicturesÃ¢Â€? link above for some close-ups of this). With this panel removed and with the liner removed, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll get some reasonable air flow through the pants for comfort in hot weather.

This is in part due to significant heterogeneity in how health literacy is measured as well as a relative lack of economic evaluations. A recent and rigorous systematic review of health literacy associated costs conducted by Eichler et al. identified 10 studies that addressed this issue. These studies suggested that the additional costs of limited health literacy on the health system level range from 3% to 5% of the total health care costs per year. Using estimates from the National Health Expenditure Report in 2009 would therefore equate the overall economic burden of low health literacy to around $75-125 billion dollars annually. Future research will define this more precisely. Research is also needed to better describe the cost-effectiveness of health literacy targeted interventions., 10332=NAALÃ‚Â - According to the most recent National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), a national survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education & National Center for Education Statistics in 2003, over 90 million Americans have trouble understanding fairly basic health information. This not only includes interpreting print information but incorporates tasks such as following medication instructions, identifying signs and symptoms of illness, and engaging in self-care behaviors. The report identifies four separate health literacy categories with examples of a health task relevant to each literacy level and the proportion of the population at each level as follows (SourceÃ¢Â€Â”NAAL Report 2003 [1]):, 4920=A comprehensive review lead by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2011 sought to summarize the current science supporting these associations, and they found that for many outcomes the quality/strength of the literature was limited in many areas due to a number of smaller, observational study designs. For example, the collective evidence was limited among studies that identified worse diabetes self-management among low health literate patients. Similar results held true for access to care, asthma severity and control, and certain screening practices (e.g. colon cancer, STD). Moderate evidence does support the association between low health literacy and increased ER visits, hospitalizations, lower influenza vaccination rates, decreased ability to interpret health messages, less mammography screening, worse medication adherence, and higher mortality among the elderly. Dewalt and Hink similarly reviewed the impact of health literacy on child health outcomes and found that children with low literacy had worse health behaviors and parents with low literacy had less health knowledge and behaviors that are advantageous for their childrenÃ¢Â€Â™s health.}"

I moved to California after graduating college in Illinois, and living there my entire life. I am a very loving person, and I like to help those around me. I am a t.v. junkie, I enjoy reading, redditing, facebooking, reading fail blog, lolcats, damn you auto correct, and many more. I'm a very random, sarcastic, optimistic person.

Functioning as s a 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase, ZADH1 catalyzes the conversion of 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-prostaglandin E2 in a NADPH-dependent manner. ZADH1 overexpression has been found to repress PPARÃ‚Â© transcriptional activity and adipocyte differentiation. Widely expressed, ZADH1 is found at highest levels in heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and prostate, with moderate levels found in brain, small intestine, lung, testis and skeletal muscle. ZADH1 exists as a monomer, utilizes NADPH as a cofactor, and undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms that are encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 14q24.3.

In most cases, the size determination is based on both the length of the aircraft and the maximum fuselage diameter. As an example, the following chart has been extracted from the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARS). Capacity Modern commercial aircraft can have the capacity to carry several hundred passengers and crew. Therefore, due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, it is critical that emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene within the minimum possible time. The maximum response time from initial notification until the first vehicle is on scene and spraying fire retardant is defined by State regulation and generally ranges from three to four minutes under conditions of good visibility and uncontaminated surfaces. At large aerodromes, this often means that more than one fire station will be necessary. This timely arrival and the firefightersÃ¢Â€Â™ initial mission to protect the aircraft against all hazards, most critically fire, increases the survivability of the passengers and crew on board. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams and other agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel in and around an aircraft. This helps to provide and maintain a path for the evacuating passengers to exit the fire hazard area. Should","To meet the requirements of the Aircraft Category for Fire Fighting, it is necessary for the aerodrome to have a declared minimum fire fighting capacity measured on the basis of the number of available vehicles and their foam production capability. In this respect, the declared Category is that actually available at the time of an aircraft approach, which may temporarily be lower than the Category normally available and so promulgated in official reference publications.

In most cases, the size determination is based on both the length of the aircraft and the maximum fuselage diameter. As an example, the following chart has been extracted from the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARS). Capacity Modern commercial aircraft can have the capacity to carry several hundred passengers and crew. Therefore, due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, it is critical that emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene within the minimum possible time. The maximum response time from initial notification until the first vehicle is on scene and spraying fire retardant is defined by State regulation and generally ranges from three to four minutes under conditions of good visibility and uncontaminated surfaces. At large aerodromes, this often means that more than one fire station will be necessary. This timely arrival and the firefightersÃ¢Â€Â™ initial mission to protect the aircraft against all hazards, most critically fire, increases the survivability of the passengers and crew on board. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams and other agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel in and around an aircraft. This helps to provide and maintain a path for the evacuating passengers to exit the fire hazard area.

The ones provided by other regulating agencies of other Member States may be slightly different. Fire Fighting Apparatus The number and type of firefighting vehicles / appliances based at an airport will be determined by the normally declared category of the airport. Specialized fire vehicles are required for the RFFS function. The design of these vehicles is predicated on many factors but primarily on speed, water-carrying capacity, off-road performance and agent discharge rates. Since an accident could occur anywhere on airport property, sufficient water and other agents must be carried to contain any fire.

He's been beaten an aggregate of 84 lengths in three starts to date though it is unusual for the yard to retain such sorts as four-year-olds so maybe there is more to come. However, PARTY PALACE has proved a good dual purpose horse for Stuart Howe over the past year and makes greater appeal after completing a hurdling hat-trick of late on good ground or quicker. He's clearly in great heart and is taken to translate that much-improved form over timber to the level.

He understood and believed in Y'shua's resurrection, having read it in the celestial account's narrative according to Genesis 15. In Genesis 18:2 he looked up into the spiritual realm and saw three (another occurrence of the resurrection number) angels. In Genesis 22:13, Abraham again looked up and saw into the spiritual realm.

The book of Jonah has two occurrences of a particular Hebrew word for resurrection, both with a yod landing in Jonah 3:3, so they ""land on"" and intersect in that verse to mark it with a kind of ""X marks the spot."" The two images show these occurrences with a green outline indicating Jonah 3:3., 49162=Deuteronomy 16:16, 50175=Matthew 5:29, 52770=Acts 12:8, 52214=1 Corinthians 15:52, 4151=It seems appropriate to clarify from the outset what is meant by the word ""day."" Depending upon the context it can refer to a literal 24 hour day, and, figuratively, to a year, or even to a period of a thousand years. (Psalm 90:4, 2 Peter 3:8) The phrase ""third day"" thus has a variety of meanings. One or more of the following may apply., 51603=1 Thessalonians 4:16, 7688=Hosea 6:2, 43140=Numbers 19:17, 16776=John 2:1, 25145=Jonah 3:3, 53117=John 21:7, 47139=1 Corinthians 3:11, 51948=Revelation 4:1, 40638=Numbers 19:19, 51258=Daniel 2:35, 29282=1 Kings 18:1, 27589=Yet another feature is the fact there are in total three occurrences of the word ""three"" in the book; two in Jonah 1:17 and one in Jonah 3:3. Amazing! Jonah is a resurrection prophet!, 31290=John 21:14, 55012=Hebrews 4:6, 7254=Luke 9:22, 24686=Jonah 2:10, 14542=To go near a woman in such a way that it prevents a ""clean garment"" status has a spiritual application that extends beyond the physical. A woman is a symbol of a church. Such a woman that would cause the saint being consecrated to become unrighteous is the topic of Revelation 18, who is a harlot Babylon church. You see, if there is a washing of water with the word that makes the Bride spotless, holy and blameless there is also a washing of impure water with the corrupted word that causes contamination. This pertains to both doctrine and practice. There is a matter of deception that is paramount when it comes to the state of readiness for the third day. Of the Harlot church, Revelation 18:23 reveals that all the nations were deceived by your sorcery. It may be rightly inferred from Matthew 24:24 that all but the chosen, the elect, will absolutely be deceived. Consecration is a setting apart for the Lord in holiness, and this means that those consecrated are set apart from among those in the Babylon church. ""Come out from her, my people"" is the call of Revelation 18:4., 21110=It's worth noting a couple other items in the context that relate to the times of resurrection in the last days: Babylon - Revelation 17-18, etc., and, ""Peace and security"" - I Thessalonians 5:3., 22313=Genesis 22:4, 41446=Ashes are what remains after something has been entirely burned, and, like dust, represent the sum and substance of the flesh. Consider the following verses in this regard. (See also Jeremiah 17:13 and John 4:10), 24292=Jonah 2:6 (Young's Literal Translation), 23902=Jonah 1:17, 54002=The application of the cake of figs to his boil speaks the humbling of the Jewish people and their acceptance of Y'shua haMashiach. This, according to Romans 11:15, is what precipitates a resurrection. This cake is a poultice of pressed, or, crushed figs. The fig is a symbol of the people of Israel, the crushing of which represents the breaking of their rebellious nature. The number 15 that appears in the account in the matter of the extension of Hezekiah's life is the number that signifies rest - complete rest. The complete rest is the sum of the Sabbath rest (the number 7) and the Shemini Atzeret type eternal rest (the number 8) (7+8=15) This, of course, speaks of some of the people typified in Hezekiah entering into the promised rest, that rest which is the subject of Hebrews 4., 25965=Now, I want to point out a notable feature from the book of Jonah. Both of the verses in Jonah that reference three days are numbered in a way that adds special emphasis to this message. They both exhibit what I call nested thirds, a doubled application of thirds. (See The Numbers Seventeen and One Hundred Fifty-Three) Consider the image showing three weeks of days. I've highlighted the third week, and within that third week I've highlighted the third day, so I've doubled the application by selecting the third of a series, twice. The count of that nested third is 17. If you scroll up to see the first reference to three days you will see it is Jonah 1:17, the seventeenth verse of the book of Jonah! Isn't that amazing! The Author does not want us to miss this lesson, and the deeper prophetic meaning of the messages about resurrection from the book of Jonah! In the ""doubled third"" numbering of the verse together with the three days it references we have a threefold identification! In the other verse referencing three days we have another threefold identification! The ""three days' walk"" is recorded in the third chapter and in the third verse! Simply amazing!, 53404=Luke 13:29, 41868=Genesis 2:7, 5927=Matthew 12:40, 42105=Genesis 18:27, 14468=A similar symbol is pictured in Revelation 7:14 as white robe.}","The companion chapter to Revelation 13 exhibits a similar phenomenon in the third verse. John 13 shows the last supper with a central theme being the revealing of Judas as the betrayer. This is a vivid and electrifying prophetic scenario detailing the revealing of the lawless one. This is exactly what is pictured above in the ""sister"" chapter Revelation 13 as the beast coming out of the sea. Both books are attributed to John ""the Revelator,"" as given by the Lord Y'shua. The whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast because this event that is also a sign to the world and worldly will come forth in an exhibition of supernatural power. It won't be a genuine resurrection event, as we see the head appointed for this aspect of the sign is seen ""as if it had been slain,"" which is to say it was not actually slain and therefore in reality dead. The event is a faking and masquerading, yes, accompanied by signs and wonders, but lying signs and wonders, plenty convincing enough for most folks to take the flashy bait and swallow the barbed hook. Revelation 13:1-3 And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names. 2) And the beast which I saw was like a leopard,","The Seventh Day is a Third Day There are two different points for beginning the count of weekdays. The obvious place to start is at the very beginning of a week, but yet we find many of the passages that refer to the third day indicate that the third is also the seventh day. Thus, a second point at which to begin counting must be acknowledged. This other starting point is at the division between the fourth and fifth days. In this alternate perspective, the seventh day is truly another third day. This overlapping count feature is similar to how the first day and the eighth day (weekly cycle) and the first and forty-ninth or fiftieth days (Yobel) are considered as one and the same. I will show that by example shortly, but to establish the validity of the second start point I will point out something quite remarkable. If you consider where the second starting point fell in the millennial week you will see the significance of this remarkable model, as the history of the world pivots about that very point! At the very close of the fourth millennium from the first man Adam, another Adam appeared; Y'shua. It is from the appearance of this latter Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45-47) that the count of days began anew. Our Gregorian calendar acknowledges that very time in history as its focal point, pivoting about it by counting forward from it with the notation A. D.

Aqaba Fortress Windsurfing Diving and snorkelling Enjoying sunny weather and beaches Sights and Activities edit Aqaba is a city in the south of Jordan, located along the Gulf of Aqaba, the northern portion of the Red Sea. It's Jordan's premier resort area and the main draw of this location are definitely its beaches and the fantastic diving and snorkeling opportunities.

Internet cafes are all around Jordan and range from 1- 2 JD for half an hour. Wifi is getting more and more popular in Jordan, but is not very common everywhere. In larger places, you find free wifi and some coffee places and restaurants. Hotels tend to charge for wifi, but not always, so check beforehand. Phone See also International Telephone Calls Jordan's international country code is 962. The emergency numbers include 112 and 911, you can use them both. Most of Jordan has mobile coverage. There are three mobile operators: Zain - the first and largest mobile provider, Orange and Umniah. You can buy SIM cards at any of these providers and if you are planning to make international calls, use Umniah as they are the cheapeast. Otherwise Zain is the better choice of mostly domestic calls. Using your own SIM in Jordan can be expensive, especially for internet. Card-based temporary numbers can be purchased at the airport or any mobile shop for JOD5. These numbers can be subsequently recharged with a prepaid card starting at only JOD1.

Next Page Ã‚Â     Previous Page      google_ad_channel = """"; google_ad_type = ""image""; google_ad_format","The following code snippet shows how to employ the Connection.prepareCall() method to instantiate a CallableStatement object based on the preceding stored procedure Ã¢ÂˆÂ’  CallableStatement cstmt = null; try { String SQL = ""{call getEmpName (?, ?)}""; cstmt = conn.prepareCall (SQL); . . . } catch (SQLException e) { . . . } finally { . . . } The String variable SQL represents the stored procedure, with parameter placeholders. Using CallableStatement objects is much like using PreparedStatement objects. You must bind values to all the parameters before executing the statement, or you will receive an SQLException. If you have IN parameters, just follow the same rules and techniques that apply to a PreparedStatement object; use the setXXX() method that corresponds to the Java data type you are binding. When you use OUT and INOUT parameters, you must employ an additional CallableStatement method, registerOutParameter(). The registerOutParameter() method binds the JDBC data type to the data type the stored procedure is expected to return. Once you call your stored procedure, you retrieve the value from the OUT parameter with the appropriate getXXX() method. This method casts the retrieved value of SQL type to a Java data type. Closing CallableStatement Object Just as you close other Statement object, for the same reason you should also close the CallableStatement object. A simple call to the close() method will do the job. If you close the Connection object first, it will close the CallableStatement object as well. However, you should",False,-1,0,"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 12:34:48 GMT",

It primarily affects the joints and is characterized by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, widespread fibrinoid degeneration of the collagen fibers in mesenchymal tissues, and by atrophy and rarefaction of bony structures. The gene represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis. The association to rheumatoid arthritis was initially thought to result from increased citrullination of target proteins (PubMed:12833157). However, variants that have been associated to rheumatoid arthritis (Ser-55, Ala-82 and Ala-112) do not affect the catalytic activity or the citrullination activity of PADI4, suggesting that these variants may affect the mRNA stability rather than the protein (PubMed:21245532).

If interested, either post your interest below or email us with the following information: Not all the events in The Cogals are actual Cogals. We also post rides and events that are of interest to the community, as well as Keepers Tours, which are Velominati-hosted, paid cycling Tours tailored to the tastes of a velominatus. Third, Cogals always include a session of Malted Recovery Beverage Consumption after the ride. Whenever possible, it should also include a pre-ride espresso. Second, a Cogal is a day-long undertaking that focuses 100% on the bike. The rides are categorized (Casually Deliberate,Ã‚Â  Rule #5,Ã‚Â  Rule #10, for example) but are long. This is what youÃ¢Â€Â™re doing today, nothing else; seeÃ‚Â  Rule #4. Rides can be any length, but a minimum distance of 130km should be expected. First, Cogals are free, organized and supported through Velominati, though not necessarily a Keeper. Anyone is welcome to join a Cogal.Ã‚Â Legally speaking, however, we have no involvement, so if you crash or die, itÃ¢Â€Â™s your own problem.

One of these was Cowans Gap, Pennsylvania. Fleming traced the origin of the name of the area to one Samuel Cowan, a British soldier who settled there either during or shortly after the Revolution. The discovery of Samuel came with an interesting, intriguing, and romantic backstory. Fleming seems to have been a bit suspicious of it, but apparently found it to be too good to ignore. So he included it in one of his Appendicies. There may well be elements of truth in the story, but the emphasis on the story definitely seems to be on the ""story part"". Samuel, though is real enough, land records show that he was in the area well before the Revolution. While we may never know the truth of the story, we now believe that Samuel was probably related to person:Hugh Cowan (4), one of Flemings ""Four Brothers Group"".

Guiding principle: You will usually be told in class what you need to learn from assigned readings. You are assigned substantial amounts of reading and writing which may not be directly addressed in class. You are expected to read short assignments that are then discussed, and often re-taught, in class. You need to review class notes and text material regularly. You seldom need to read anything more than once, and sometimes listening in class is enough. You need to study at least 2 to 3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. You may study outside class as little as 0 to 2 hours a week, and this may be mostly last-minute test preparation. Classes may number 100 students or more. Classes generally have no more than 35 students. The academic year is divided into two separate 15-week semesters, plus a week after each semester for exams. The school year is 36 weeks long; some classes extend over both semesters and some don't.

However, the connection is not encrypted. The use of identity verification effectively prevents domain spoofing, but federation requires proper DNS setup and is still subject to DNS poisoning attacks. Verified federation has been the default service policy followed by servers on the open XMPP network from October 2000 until now., 6026=Permissive Federation -- a server accepts a connection from any other peer on the network, even without verifiying the identity of the peer based on DNS lookups. The lack of peer verification or authentication means that domains can be spoofed. Permissive federation was effectively outlawed on the Jabber network in October 2000 with the release of the jabberd 1.2 server, which included support for the newly-developed Server Dialback (XEP-0220) [2] protocol.}","Table 1: Example Servers To simplify the text, this document uses the following terminology. For each service type, the domain ""example.lit"" is used to illustrate connections to that same service type. 2. Terminology The remainder of this document describes in more detail the protocol flows that make it possible to deploy verified federation, encrypted federation, and trusted federation. Protocol flows are shown for federation attempts between various combinations to illustrate the interaction between different federation policies. Trusted Federation -- a server accepts a connection from a peer only if the peer supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the peer presents a digital certificate issued by a trusted root certification authority (CA). The list of trusted root CAs is determined by local service policy, as is the level of trust accorded to various types of certificates (i.e., Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3). The use of trusted domain certificates effectively prevents DNS poisoning attacks but makes federation more difficult since typically such certificates are not easy to obtain. Encrypted Federation -- a server accepts a connection from a peer only if the peer supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) as defined for XMPP in XMPP Core [3] and the peer presents a digital certificate. However, the certificate may be self-signed, in which case mutual authentication is typically not possible. Therefore, after STARTTLS negotiation the parties proceed to weakly verify identity using Server Dialback. This combination results in an encrypted connection","3. Connection Success The following table summarizes the results of connection attempts between the various services, where ""U"" stands for ""Unsuccessful"", ""V"" stands for ""Verified"", ""E"" stands for ""Encrypted"", and ""T"" stands for ""Trusted"". The rows indicate the initiating service and the columns indicate the receiving service.

Connections from Type 1 Services 4.1 Type 1 to Type 1 In this scenario, an XMPP user citizen@type1.lit attempts to send an XML stanza to user@example.lit. Example 1.

In England & Wales, economic activity rates declined by 0.5 per cent between 1991 and 2001, resulting in a figure of 66.5 per cent.

By 2001, the largest inactive category was retired (14 per cent). The Ã¢Â€Â˜OtherÃ¢Â€Â™ category was split to show people looking after their family/home separately from others, but when these two were combined, they had fallen from 14 per cent in 1991 to 8 per cent in 2001.

Lewis? In this thesis I demonstrate that LewisÃ¢\x80\x99s conception of time as exemplified throughout his works, but particularly in the Chronicles of Narnia and The Great Divorce, makes up a coherent philosophy of time. This philosophy of time draws on Christian theology, particularly the works of Augustine and Boethius, but it is nonetheless applicable to the modern debates about the ontology of time. C.S. Lewis lived through the years following J.M.E. McTaggartÃ¢\x80\x99s famous essay Ã¢\x80\x9cThe Unreality of TimeÃ¢\x80? and the subsequent polarization which resulted in two distinct conceptions of time called the A- theory and the B-theory. I argue that in his fiction, and particularly in the final chapters of The Great Divorce, Lewis provides a potential answer to this division by creating a synthetic view of the relationship of A-theory and B-theory time series.', 'en_US', 'Baylor University projects are protected by copyright.

Es ist die lustige Geschichte einer chaotischen Klasse, die keine Aussicht auf jemalige Absolvierung der Oberstufe hat, aber von der Schule auch nicht entfernt wird, da der Direktor der Privatschule auf das Geld der reichen Eltern angewiesen ist. Zudem hat die Klasse das Herz der meisten Schulangestellten erobert, so dass keiner der Angestellten es ÃƒÂ¼ber das Herz bringt, den gestellten Antrag auf Entfernung der Klasse oder einzelner SchÃƒÂ¼ler der Klasse von der Schule bis zum Schluss durchzuziehen. In diesem Film spielte Sunal den naiven Ã„Â°nek Ã…Âžaban (sinngemÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸ Schaban, das Rindvieh)., 2010=Kemal Sunal starb am 3. Juli 2000 an einem Herzinfarkt, den er Ã¢Â€Â“ bedingt durch seine panische Flugangst Ã¢Â€Â“ beim Flug nach Trabzon erlitt., 2574=Anerkennung fÃƒÂ¼r seine schauspielerischen FÃƒÂ¤higkeiten findet Kemal Sunal 1977 mit dem Preis fÃƒÂ¼r die Beste mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Hauptrolle des Antalya Film Festivals im Film KapÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±lar KralÃ„Â± (KÃƒÂ¶nig der Hausmeister). Seine Filme sind aus anfÃƒÂ¤nglich naiven 70er-Jahre-KomÃƒÂ¶dien mit der Zeit zu immer sozialkritischeren KomÃƒÂ¶dien geworden, wurden aber wegen des hÃƒÂ¤ufigen Gebrauchs von SchimpfwÃƒÂ¶rtern und Umgangssprachen kritisiert., 2650=Zwischen den Jahren 1972 bis 1999 drehte er insgesamt 84 Filme., 6024=Kemal Sunal wurde am 11. November 1944 in DoÃ„ÂŸanyol/Malatya geboren. Im Alter von sieben Jahren zog er mit seiner Familie nach Istanbul. Dort besuchte er das Vefa-Gymnasium in Fatih. Danach belegte er auf der Marmara-UniversitÃƒÂ¤t Kurse fÃƒÂ¼r Massenmedien Radio, Fernsehen und Film, konnte aber durch die im Land herrschenden politischen Unruhen und den MilitÃƒÂ¤rputsch 1980 das Studium nicht fortsetzen. Seinen Abschluss holte er 1995 im Alter von 51 Jahren nach.}"

Assuming a general Dirac structure for the four-fermion contact interactions of interest, we study the cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra and show that good fits to the current data can be obtained for both charged-lepton-flavor-conserving and flavor-violating decay channels. We find that different choices for the Dirac structure of the underlying decay operator can be significantly compensated by different choices for the dark-matter mass and lifetime. The decay modes we consider provide differing predictions for the cosmic-ray positron fraction at energies higher than those currently probed at the PAMELA experiment; these predictions might be tested at cosmic-ray detectors like AMS-02. Additionally, we consider the constraints imposed on these decays by neutrino and gamma-ray observatories.

Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. Robert G. Edwards, the physiologist who developed the treatment, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010. With egg donation and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years or menopause can still become pregnant. Adriana Iliescu held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006., 116046=A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had ""religious-based objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive children by artificial insemination,"" and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.[91][92] The California Medical Association had initially sided with Brody and Fenton, but the case, North Coast Women's Care Medical Group v. Superior Court, was decided unanimously by the California State Supreme Court in favor of Benitez on 19 August 2008.[93][94], 74486=A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a relative risk of birth defects of 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.24Ã¢Â€Â“1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.[50] In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably septal heart defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, esophageal atresia, and anorectal atresia; the mechanism of causality is unclear.[51] However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: ""The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors."" [52] Parental factors included known independent risks for birth defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI (corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying male infertility factors (which would be associated with the use of ICSI) may contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study [53] and ""...implicates patient factors in this increased risk."" The authors of the Danish national registry study speculate: ""...our results suggest that the reported increased prevalence of congenital malformations seen in singletons born after assisted reproductive technology is partly due to the underlying infertility or its determinants."", 61923=A 2013 review and metaanalysis of randomised controlled trials of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy in IVF found no overall benefit, and concluded that an apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of pregnancy requires further study, due to the possibility of publication bias and other factors.[41], 109903=Many people do not oppose the IVF practice itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through ""artificial"" ways) but are highly critical of the current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multi-billion industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see Suleman octuplets). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry ""corrupt"" and ""greedy"" saying that ""One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry,"" and that ""What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology"", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation ""The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to"".[84] The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.[85] The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them.[86][87] Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr. Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of the early days of the IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: ""It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. Now it's a first resort. I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can harm women in the long run.""[88] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to Ã¢Â€Â˜sellÃ¢Â€Â™ corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the Ã¢Â€Â˜healthyÃ¢Â€Â™ or Ã¢Â€Â˜normalÃ¢Â€Â™ body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring., 115161=A 2009 statement from the ASRM found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation.[90], 46922=Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) summarised 2008-9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age., 32666=The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a culture media in order for the actual fertilisation to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher pregnancy rates than 16 to 24 hours.[12] In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two pronuclei. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells., 104800=In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, Louise Brown on 25 July 1978, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.[76][77][78], 117541=Nadya Suleman came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his license. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical license be revoked effective 1 July 2011.[95][96] [97], 49108=In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.[21] A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the center and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to adoption (46%) or spontaneous pregnancy (42%).[25], 121017=In 2000, a web site called Donor Sibling Registry was created to help biological children with a common donor connect with each other.[99][102], 45251=In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.[21] Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.[22] Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, because it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples., 134292=In the USA, overall availability of IVF in 2005 was 2.5 IVF physicians per 100,000 population, and utilisation was 236 IVF cycles per 100,000.[118] Utilisation highly increases with availability and IVF insurance coverage, and to a significant extent also with percentage of single persons and median income.[118] In the USA 126 procedures are performed per million people per year. In the USA an average cycle, from egg retrieval to embryo implantation, costs $12,400, and insurance companies that do cover treatment, even partially, usually cap the number of cycles they pay for.[119], 141941=Federal regulations in the United States include screening requirements and restrictions on donations, but generally do not affect sexually intimate partners.[133] However, doctors may be required to provide treatments due to nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California.[94] The US state of Tennessee proposed a bill in 2009 that would have defined donor IVF as adoption.[134] During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF.[135][136] Neither of these bills passed.[137][138], 137393=Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed per million people per year. The second highest rate is in Iceland, with 899 procedures per million people per year. Israel provides unlimited free in vitro procedures for its citizens for up to two children per woman under 45 years of age. In other countries the coverage of such procedures is limited if it exists at all. The Israeli Health Ministry says it spends roughly $3450 per procedure., 141032=All major restrictions on single but infertile women using IVF were lifted in Australia in 2002 after a final appeal to the Australian High Court was rejected on procedural grounds in the Leesa Meldrum case. A Victorian federal court had ruled in 2000 that the existing ban on all single women and lesbians using IVF constituted sex discrimination.[131] Victoria's government announced changes to its IVF law in 2007 eliminating remaining restrictions on fertile single women and lesbians, leaving South Australia as the only state maintaining them.[132], 121519=In 2012, a documentary called Anonymous Father's Day was released that focuses on donor-conceived children.[103], 51249=In a 2005 Swedish study,[28] 166 women were monitored starting one month before their IVF cycles, and the results showed no significant correlation between psychological stress and IVF outcome. The study concluded with the recommendation to clinics that it might be possible to reduce the stress experienced by IVF patients during the treatment procedure by informing them of those findings. While psychological stress experienced during a cycle might not influence an IVF outcome, it is possible that the experience of IVF can result in stress that leads to depression. The financial consequences alone of IVF can influence anxiety and become overwhelming. However, for many couples, the alternative is infertility, and the experience of infertility itself can also cause extreme stress and depression., 119676=Alana Stewart, who was conceived using donor sperm, began an online forum for donor children called AnonymousUS in 2010. The forum welcomes the viewpoints of anyone involved in the IVF process.[100] Olivia Pratten, a donor-conceived Canadian, sued the province of British Columbia for access to records on her donor father's identity in 2008.[101] ""IÃ¢Â€Â™m not a treatment, IÃ¢Â€Â™m a person, and those records belong to me,Ã¢Â€? Pratten said.[98] In May 2012, a court ruled in Pratten's favor, agreeing that the laws at the time discrimiated against donor children and making anonymous sperm and egg donation in British Columbia illegal.[101], 138620=Government agencies in China passed bans on the use of IVF in 2003 by unmarried women or by couples with certain infectious diseases.[125], 48465=The 2009 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine included the following data for the United States:[23], 139478=Costa Rica has a complete ban on IVF technology, it having been ruled unconstitutional by the nation's Supreme Court because it ""violated life.""[127] Costa Rica is the only country in the western hemisphere that forbids IVF. A law project sent reluctantly by the government of President Laura Chinchilla was rejected by parliament. President Chinchilla has not publicly stated her position on the question of IVF. However, given the massive influence of the Catholic Church in her government any change in the status quo seems very unlikely.[128][129] In spite of Costa Rican government and strong religious opposition, the IVF ban has been struck down by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in a decision of 20 December 2012. The court said that a long-standing Costa Rican guarantee of protection for every human embryo violated the reproductive freedom of infertile couples because it prohibited them from using IVF, which often involves the disposal of embryos not implanted in a patientÃ¢Â€Â™s uterus.[130], 98337=Though cytoplasmic transfer does not involve the transfer of nuclear DNA, there may still be a small amount of mitochondrial DNA present from the donor. Children conceived through this process occasionally test positive for genetic material from three parents. There is much concern associated with the potential transfer of mitochondrial DNA and its unknown interaction with the foreign DNA of the recipient egg. There is also no data as to the health of maturing children conceived through cytoplasmic transfer, the first successful birth having occurred in 1997 at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey as a result of procedure performed by The Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science.[70] The procedure is not currently approved for general use in any country aside from the United Kingdom, which legalised it in February 2015.[71][72], 37492=Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge oocyte and embryo quality. In order to optimise pregnancy rates, there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.[15] Since 2009 where the first time-lapse microscopy system for IVF was approved for clinical use,[16] morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to improve to pregnancy rates further.[17], 43999=The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include miscarriage or stillbirth and multiple-order births such as twins and triplets are counted as one pregnancy. A 2012 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data:[20]}","The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include miscarriage or stillbirth and multiple-order births such as twins and triplets are counted as one pregnancy. A 2012 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data:[20] Live birth rate[edit] Due to advances in reproductive technology, IVF success rates are substantially higher today than they were just a few years ago. IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures which result in a favorable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the pregnancy rate, or the number of live births, called the live birth rate. Success rates[edit] On the other hand, growth hormone or aspirin as adjunctive medication in IVF have no evidence of overall benefit.[14] Luteal support is the administration of medication, generally progesterone, progestins or GnRH agonists, to increase the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing and/or supporting","In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.[21] Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated.

Adriana Iliescu held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006., 116046=A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had ""religious-based objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive children by artificial insemination,"" and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds.[91][92] The California Medical Association had initially sided with Brody and Fenton, but the case, North Coast Women's Care Medical Group v. Superior Court, was decided unanimously by the California State Supreme Court in favor of Benitez on 19 August 2008.[93][94], 74486=A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a relative risk of birth defects of 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.24Ã¢Â€Â“1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.[50] In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably septal heart defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, esophageal atresia, and anorectal atresia; the mechanism of causality is unclear.[51] However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: ""The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors."" [52] Parental factors included known independent risks for birth defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI (corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying male infertility factors (which would be associated with the use of ICSI) may contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study [53] and ""...implicates patient factors in this increased risk."" The authors of the Danish national registry study speculate: ""...our results suggest that the reported increased prevalence of congenital malformations seen in singletons born after assisted reproductive technology is partly due to the underlying infertility or its determinants."", 61923=A 2013 review and metaanalysis of randomised controlled trials of acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy in IVF found no overall benefit, and concluded that an apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of pregnancy requires further study, due to the possibility of publication bias and other factors.[41], 109903=Many people do not oppose the IVF practice itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through ""artificial"" ways) but are highly critical of the current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multi-billion industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see Suleman octuplets). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry ""corrupt"" and ""greedy"" saying that ""One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry,"" and that ""What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology"", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation ""The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to"".[84] The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.[85] The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them.[86][87] Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr. Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of the early days of the IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: ""It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. Now it's a first resort. I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can harm women in the long run.""[88] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to Ã¢Â€Â˜sellÃ¢Â€Â™ corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the Ã¢Â€Â˜healthyÃ¢Â€Â™ or Ã¢Â€Â˜normalÃ¢Â€Â™ body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring., 115161=A 2009 statement from the ASRM found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation.[90], 46922=Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) summarised 2008-9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age., 32666=The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a culture media in order for the actual fertilisation to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher pregnancy rates than 16 to 24 hours.[12] In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two pronuclei. In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells., 104800=In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, Louise Brown on 25 July 1978, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.[76][77][78], 117541=Nadya Suleman came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his license. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical license be revoked effective 1 July 2011.[95][96] [97], 49108=In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%.[21] A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the center and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to adoption (46%) or spontaneous pregnancy (42%).[25], 121017=In 2000, a web site called Donor Sibling Registry was created to help biological children with a common donor connect with each other.[99][102], 45251=In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%.[21] Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated.[22] Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, because it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples., 134292=In the USA, overall availability of IVF in 2005 was 2.5 IVF physicians per 100,000 population, and utilisation was 236 IVF cycles per 100,000.[118] Utilisation highly increases with availability and IVF insurance coverage, and to a significant extent also with percentage of single persons and median income.[118] In the USA 126 procedures are performed per million people per year. In the USA an average cycle, from egg retrieval to embryo implantation, costs $12,400, and insurance companies that do cover treatment, even partially, usually cap the number of cycles they pay for.[119], 141941=Federal regulations in the United States include screening requirements and restrictions on donations, but generally do not affect sexually intimate partners.[133] However, doctors may be required to provide treatments due to nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California.[94] The US state of Tennessee proposed a bill in 2009 that would have defined donor IVF as adoption.[134] During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF.[135][136] Neither of these bills passed.[137][138], 137393=Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed per million people per year. The second highest rate is in Iceland, with 899 procedures per million people per year. Israel provides unlimited free in vitro procedures for its citizens for up to two children per woman under 45 years of age. In other countries the coverage of such procedures is limited if it exists at all. The Israeli Health Ministry says it spends roughly $3450 per procedure., 141032=All major restrictions on single but infertile women using IVF were lifted in Australia in 2002 after a final appeal to the Australian High Court was rejected on procedural grounds in the Leesa Meldrum case. A Victorian federal court had ruled in 2000 that the existing ban on all single women and lesbians using IVF constituted sex discrimination.[131] Victoria's government announced changes to its IVF law in 2007 eliminating remaining restrictions on fertile single women and lesbians, leaving South Australia as the only state maintaining them.[132], 121519=In 2012, a documentary called Anonymous Father's Day was released that focuses on donor-conceived children.[103], 51249=In a 2005 Swedish study,[28] 166 women were monitored starting one month before their IVF cycles, and the results showed no significant correlation between psychological stress and IVF outcome. The study concluded with the recommendation to clinics that it might be possible to reduce the stress experienced by IVF patients during the treatment procedure by informing them of those findings. While psychological stress experienced during a cycle might not influence an IVF outcome, it is possible that the experience of IVF can result in stress that leads to depression. The financial consequences alone of IVF can influence anxiety and become overwhelming. However, for many couples, the alternative is infertility, and the experience of infertility itself can also cause extreme stress and depression., 119676=Alana Stewart, who was conceived using donor sperm, began an online forum for donor children called AnonymousUS in 2010. The forum welcomes the viewpoints of anyone involved in the IVF process.[100] Olivia Pratten, a donor-conceived Canadian, sued the province of British Columbia for access to records on her donor father's identity in 2008.[101] ""IÃ¢Â€Â™m not a treatment, IÃ¢Â€Â™m a person, and those records belong to me,Ã¢Â€? Pratten said.[98] In May 2012, a court ruled in Pratten's favor, agreeing that the laws at the time discrimiated against donor children and making anonymous sperm and egg donation in British Columbia illegal.[101], 138620=Government agencies in China passed bans on the use of IVF in 2003 by unmarried women or by couples with certain infectious diseases.[125], 48465=The 2009 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine included the following data for the United States:[23], 139478=Costa Rica has a complete ban on IVF technology, it having been ruled unconstitutional by the nation's Supreme Court because it ""violated life.""[127] Costa Rica is the only country in the western hemisphere that forbids IVF. A law project sent reluctantly by the government of President Laura Chinchilla was rejected by parliament. President Chinchilla has not publicly stated her position on the question of IVF. However, given the massive influence of the Catholic Church in her government any change in the status quo seems very unlikely.[128][129] In spite of Costa Rican government and strong religious opposition, the IVF ban has been struck down by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in a decision of 20 December 2012. The court said that a long-standing Costa Rican guarantee of protection for every human embryo violated the reproductive freedom of infertile couples because it prohibited them from using IVF, which often involves the disposal of embryos not implanted in a patientÃ¢Â€Â™s uterus.[130], 98337=Though cytoplasmic transfer does not involve the transfer of nuclear DNA, there may still be a small amount of mitochondrial DNA present from the donor. Children conceived through this process occasionally test positive for genetic material from three parents. There is much concern associated with the potential transfer of mitochondrial DNA and its unknown interaction with the foreign DNA of the recipient egg. There is also no data as to the health of maturing children conceived through cytoplasmic transfer, the first successful birth having occurred in 1997 at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey as a result of procedure performed by The Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science.[70] The procedure is not currently approved for general use in any country aside from the United Kingdom, which legalised it in February 2015.[71][72], 37492=Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge oocyte and embryo quality. In order to optimise pregnancy rates, there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos.[15] Since 2009 where the first time-lapse microscopy system for IVF was approved for clinical use,[16] morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to improve to pregnancy rates further.[17], 43999=The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include miscarriage or stillbirth and multiple-order births such as twins and triplets are counted as one pregnancy. A 2012 summary compiled by the Society for Reproductive Medicine which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data:[20]}","A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a relative risk of birth defects of 1.32 (95% confidence interval 1.24Ã¢Â€Â“1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants.[50] In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably septal heart defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, esophageal atresia, and anorectal atresia; the mechanism of causality is unclear.[51] However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: ""The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors.""

The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any","Other risks to the offspring[edit] If the underlying infertility is related to abnormalities in spermatogenesis, it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring is at higher risk for sperm abnormalities. IVF does not seem to confer any risks regarding cognitive development, school performance, social functioning and behaviour.[55] Also, IVF infants are known to be as securely attached to their parents as those who were naturally conceived, and IVF adolescents are as well-adjusted as those who have been naturally conceived.[56] Limited long-term follow-up data suggest that IVF may be associated with an increased incidence of hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, increase in total body fat composition, advancement of bone age, subclinical thyroid disorder, early adulthood clinical depression and binge drinking in the offspring.[55][57] It is not known, however, whether these potential associations are caused by the IVF procedure in itself, by adverse obstetric outcomes associated with IVF, by the genetic origin of the children or by yet unknown IVF-associated causes.[55][57] Increases in embryo manipulation during IVF result in more deviant fetal growth curves, but birth weight does not seem to be a reliable marker of fetal stress.[58] IVF, including",True,0,0,"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT",

En 1848, la profondeur est passÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  2,7Ã‚Â mÃƒÂ¨tres tout comme le reste de la voie du Saint-Laurent vers lÃ¢Â€Â™ocÃƒÂ©an., 11534=La construction du canal dÃƒÂ©buta en 1913 et fut terminÃƒÂ©e en 1932. Le canal est depuis composÃƒÂ© de 7 ÃƒÂ©cluses au niveau de lÃ¢Â€Â™escarpement de Niagara et dÃ¢Â€Â™une huitiÃƒÂ¨me ÃƒÂ  Port Colborne pour contrÃƒÂ´ler la profondeur du canal. La profondeur est de 7,6Ã‚Â mÃƒÂ¨tres et les ÃƒÂ©cluses font 233,5 de long sur 24,4Ã‚Â m de large., 8392=Le 25 aoÃƒÂ»t 1974, le navire Steelton heurta le pont 12 dans Port Robinson. Le pont fut dÃƒÂ©truit par le choc sans causer de victime. Le pont ne fut jamais rÃƒÂ©parÃƒÂ© et les habitants durent emprunter un ferry pour traverser le canal. Des archives concernant lÃ¢Â€Â™accident se trouvent dans la bibliothÃƒÂ¨que publique de Welland., 13084=En 1887, une voie raccourcie fut complÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©e entre St. Catharines et Port Dalhousie. Une des rÃƒÂ©alisations exceptionnelles de ce troisiÃƒÂ¨me canal fut le tunnel de Merritton permettant ÃƒÂ  une voie de chemin de fer du Grand Trunk Railway de passer sous le canal au niveau de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©cluse 18. La nouvelle voie avait une profondeur minimale de 4,3Ã‚Â m et possÃƒÂ©dait 26 ÃƒÂ©cluses en pierres (82,3Ã‚Â m sur 13,7Ã‚Â m). Le canal ÃƒÂ©tait pourtant toujours trop petit pour certains bateauxÃ¢Â€Â¦, 5582=Un autre navire nommÃƒÂ© Windoc, appartenant au mÃƒÂªme armement, avait ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© victime d'un accident semblable le 2 octobre 1938, mais sans consÃƒÂ©quences graves[3]., 18930=La sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© Welland Canal Company fut crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©e en 1824 par William Hamilton Merritt, pour rÃƒÂ©guler le dÃƒÂ©bit de lÃ¢Â€Â™eau utilisÃƒÂ©e pour ses moulins ÃƒÂ  eau. La construction dÃƒÂ©buta ÃƒÂ  Allanburg le 30 novembre 1824 (le lieu exact est marquÃƒÂ© du cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© ouest du pont noÃ‚Â 11 (Autoroute 20)). Le canal ouvrit 5 ans plus tard le 30 novembre 1829 pour un premier essai. Le premier bateau ÃƒÂ  passer fut Annie & Jane. Le canal partait de Port Dalhousie sur le lac Ontario, allait ÃƒÂ  Saint Catharines avant de passer les localitÃƒÂ©s de Merritton, Thorold et Allanburg. Il arrivait alors ÃƒÂ  Port Robinson oÃƒÂ¹ il rejoignait la riviÃƒÂ¨re Welland qui permettait aux bateaux de rejoindre Chippawa., 14299=ÃƒÂ€ partir de 1854, lÃ¢Â€Â™apparition du chemin de fer apporta une nouvelle concurrence. En 1859, la compagnie Welland Railway ouvrit une voie parallÃƒÂ¨le au canal. Ce chemin de fer ÃƒÂ©tait liÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  la compagnie du canal et ÃƒÂ©tait utilisÃƒÂ© pour aider le transfert des marchandises des cargos des lacs qui ÃƒÂ©taient trop grands pour pouvoir emprunter certaines ÃƒÂ©cluses. Il ÃƒÂ©tait dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  clair que le canal devrait ÃƒÂªtre agrandi pour ÃƒÂ©viter ces manipulations., 7359=Le 11 aoÃƒÂ»t 2001, le cargo Windoc entra en collision avec le pont noÃ‚Â 11 ÃƒÂ  Allanburg, OntarioÃ‚Â (en), bloquant le trafic pendant deux jours. L'accident dÃƒÂ©truisit la passerelle et la cheminÃƒÂ©e du navire, dÃƒÂ©clencha un fort incendie ÃƒÂ  bord, et causa des dommages mineurs au pont levant. Le navire privÃƒÂ© de direction alla s'ÃƒÂ©chouer le long du canal. Le navire ÃƒÂ©tait irrÃƒÂ©parable, mais il n'y eut pas de blessÃƒÂ©s, et pas de pollution de la voie d'eau. Les dÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ¢ts au pont ÃƒÂ©taient limitÃƒÂ©s au centre de la travÃƒÂ©e levante. Le pont fut rÃƒÂ©parÃƒÂ© en quelques semaines et rouvert au trafic de vÃƒÂ©hicules le 16 novembre 2001. Le rapport d'investigation officiel a concluÃ‚Â : ""Il est probable que le jugement de l'opÃƒÂ©rateur du pont levant ÃƒÂ©tait diminuÃƒÂ© quand la travÃƒÂ©e levante a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© abaissÃƒÂ©e sur le Windoc.""[1],[2]., 16651=Une extension fut ouverte en 1833 ÃƒÂ  partir de Port Robinson. LÃ¢Â€Â™extension suivait la riviÃƒÂ¨re Welland jusque la ville de Welland avant de prendre la direction du sud vers Port Colborne sur le lac ÃƒÂ‰riÃƒÂ©. Un autre canal dÃ¢Â€Â™alimentation reliait la ville de Welland ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ouest de la localitÃƒÂ© de Rock Point. AprÃƒÂ¨s lÃ¢Â€Â™ouverture de cette extension, le canal mesurait 44Ã‚Â km et possÃƒÂ©dait 40 ÃƒÂ©cluses en bois. La taille minimale dÃ¢Â€Â™une ÃƒÂ©cluse ÃƒÂ©tait de 33,5Ã‚Â m sur 6,7Ã‚Â m pour une profondeur minimale de 2,4Ã‚Â m.}"

The Rhythms del Mundo series is a nonprofit project intended to raise awareness for climate change and disaster relief in conjunction with Artists Project Earth (APE). Produced by music industry veterans Kenny Young and the Berman Brothers, the first album in the series, Rhythms del Mundo: Cuba (2006), finds affiliates of the Afro-Cuban superstar group Buena Vista Social Club reworking a bunch of contemporary pop/rock favorites by Coldplay (""Clocks""), U2 (""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For""), Radiohead (""High and Dry""), and others. Recorded at Abdala Studios in Havana, Cuba, from April 2005 to June 2006, the album features a star-studded lineup of British talent, plus Buena Vista Social Club favorites Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, and fellow Cuban vocalists Coco Freeman, Vania Borges, Aquila Rose, and El Lele of Los Van Van. Moreover, the Rhythms del Mundo band includes Barbarito Torres, Amadito ValdÃƒÂ©s, Virgilio Valdes, Angel Terri Domech, Manuel ""Guajiro"" Mirabal, Orlando ""Cachaito"" Lopez, and Demetrio Muniz. The second album in the series, Rhythms del Mundo: Cubano AlemÃƒÂ¡n (2008), is similar to the first, albeit with contemporary pop/rock oriented toward the German-language market. It features Afro-Cuban versions of recent hits by some of the biggest names in German pop/rock, including Ich + Ich, 2raumwohnung, Xavier Naidoo, Jan Delay, Rosenstolz, and Silbermond. The third album in the series, Rhythms del Mundo: Classics, is a return to English language that finds an international lineup of contemporary pop/rockers covering well-known hits from yesteryear (i.e., ""classics""). Unlike the first album, there are only a couple Cuban vocalists features on this one.}"

Customer Reviews Still the best ever Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  by Melia B On a whim I downloaded this album and it took my breath away. Sure, it was great listening to Earth Wind & Fire in the 70s -- they were musically perfect, their songs were funky and they offered relief from disco, though they reflected the times. Then, I ""grew up."" I fell for New Wave, then Grunge and Alternative, with a little Madonna thrown in. Fast forward 25 years. I hear them with a clear mind. How could I have lived for so long without this music in my life? Their songs are uplifting but not saccharine. The melodies are complex and masterfully orchestrated.

Azerbaijan, Belgium and Bosnia and Herzegovina attach particular importance to the work carried out by the Council of Europe to promote greater social cohesion. United by the needs and expectations specific to their age, young people constitute a social group requiring special attention. And this must begin by ensuring full respect for childrenÃ¢Â€Â™s rights as defined in the International Convention on the Rights of the Child which this year is celebrating its 25th anniversary.

A passport and a MiraCosta College identification card are usually sufficient. Some banks will also require a Social Security Number or a Tax Identification Number. At least $100 is usually required to open an account, and there will be a monthly service charge for the account unless a ""minimum balance requirement"" (as much as $500 or higher) is maintained. There will also be a charge to have checks printed. Banks often have ""hidden"" fees so be sure to inquire about all possible fees. Requirements for Opening a Bank Account The two main types of bank accounts are checking accounts, which allow checks to be written, and savings accounts, which offer a place to keep money and earn interest. Some checking accounts also pay interest. Most people in the U.S. pay their bills with checks. Also checks may be necessary for paying your rent. Cash should never be sent in the mail to pay for a bill or for any other reason. Most banks are open Monday through Friday from morning until mid-afternoon, and some are open also on Saturday morning. Upon opening an account, an ATM card will be offered in order to get money out of the account at any hour, day or night in the ATM machines. These cards can be used at automated teller machines (ATMs) all over the city, state, and country.
