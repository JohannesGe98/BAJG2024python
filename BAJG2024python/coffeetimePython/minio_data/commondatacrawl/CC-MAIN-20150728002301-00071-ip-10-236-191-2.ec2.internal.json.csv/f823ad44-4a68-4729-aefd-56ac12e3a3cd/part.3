Tips for prospective students NETWORK! NETWORK! NETWORK! Morgan State is indeed a HBCU (Historically Black College) but that still does not mean the University is not diverse. This school has many different backgrounds of people coming from all types of life. So a tip from this sophomore, is to get to know people and learn from the different cultures. This advice is not just for Morgan State, but for anywhere you go. A open mind is the best mind. I would also recommend that you have a good communication pathway with your professors. This will help you get through college. Having the professors know who you are, are good for them, since they see you more than a student identification number, but more so as a individual.

NETWORK! NETWORK! Morgan State is indeed a HBCU (Historically Black College) but that still does not mean the University is not diverse. This school has many different backgrounds of people coming from all types of life. So a tip from this sophomore, is to get to know people and learn from the different cultures. This advice is not just for Morgan State, but for anywhere you go. A open mind is the best mind. I would also recommend that you have a good communication pathway with your professors. This will help you get through college. Having the professors know who you are, are good for them, since they see you more than a student identification number, but more so as a individual.

Before I got here I did expect this school to be all about partying but it actually is not. There are occasional parties here and there but not as many that I was expecting. Here at Morgan we are a big family and we all have fun together. Here at Morgan our fun consist of going to basketball games, volleyball games, and football games. These are probably the most enjoyable things to do on campus.', ""At Morgan State there are not many places to eat which is a big disappointment. We have Rawlings Dining hall, the student canteen, Subway, Auntie Ann's and not to far from campus is a McDonald's. The food at Morgan State University is not the best. I actually stopped going to the Rawlings Dining hall because their food makes me sick. Mainly I go to the canteen which has pizza, a sandwich shop, salad bar and other food items. I wish that Morgan would add more places to eat on campus. The choices of food on campus is very limited."", 'I do live on campus in Blount Towers and I have to say it is not as bad as I pictured it being. I was very nervous about the bathroom situation but you do get used to it. There are three stalls, three showers and three sinks in each bathroom. The rooms are also very spacious. I live on the eighth floor which is sometimes a burden especially when the elevators no longer work and you have to walk up and down eight flights of stairs. I would also recommend being roommates with someone you already know. I am roommates with someone I do not know and we are complete opposites. My side of the room is neat and clean while her side looks like a tornado hit it.', 'The academic rigor here at Morgan is not very stressful you just have to make sure that your are spending all your time right. Being here in college definitely requires that you study. I know most people say that in high school they never studied. Well here at Morgan State and for that matter any University you must study to see the grade that you want.', 'Some tips for some prospective students looking into Morgan State would be get everything done early. If you plan to live on campus make sure you sign up for everything on time. Do not wait until the last minute to get everything set up which is what I did.', 'I would give Morgan State University four stars. Morgan State University is a very well rounded school. The professors all are very great with their students and want to see them succeed.']]",Morgan State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Morgan-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/62289,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,132,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00071-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,895142071,895027661,HORIZONTAL,"{591462=Morgan State University is a safe and clean place to get an education.

Morgan State University utilizes & maintains a full-time, 24/7/365 Campus Police & Public Safety department. All uniformed officers and dispatchers have gone through extensive training, and provide patrol of all residence halls, academic buildings, and campus parking areas. All officers are fully trained to respond during any emergency and crisis situations. The safety of the Morgan State University community during an emergency is predicated on advance planning, as well as building awareness about how the plans will be implemented.

NETWORK! NETWORK! Morgan State is indeed a HBCU (Historically Black College) but that still does not mean the University is not diverse. This school has many different backgrounds of people coming from all types of life. So a tip from this sophomore, is to get to know people and learn from the different cultures. This advice is not just for Morgan State, but for anywhere you go. A open mind is the best mind. I would also recommend that you have a good communication pathway with your professors. This will help you get through college. Having the professors know who you are, are good for them, since they see you more than a student identification number, but more so as a individual.

NETWORK! NETWORK! Morgan State is indeed a HBCU (Historically Black College) but that still does not mean the University is not diverse. This school has many different backgrounds of people coming from all types of life. So a tip from this sophomore, is to get to know people and learn from the different cultures. This advice is not just for Morgan State, but for anywhere you go. A open mind is the best mind. I would also recommend that you have a good communication pathway with your professors. This will help you get through college. Having the professors know who you are, are good for them, since they see you more than a student identification number, but more so as a individual.

When you buy textbooks, check out the coupon booklet they give you at the register that√¢\x80\x99s loaded with discounts. Also, take advantage of free PE classes during the first week of every term since it√¢\x80\x99s a great way to vary your workout and meet new people. Western constantly strives to better their campus community and the university experience through their resources. Even with budget cuts, WWU looks for ways to offer their students uncompromised, high quality education. Learning isn√¢\x80\x99t just about listening to a lecture, or writing down notes, but doing. Do everything you can to succeed and you will.', 'Walking through Red Square between classes, you√¢\x80\x99ll see booths for activities, clubs, and causes along with random student stunts and skits. Red Square is like the living room of WWU and reflects the quirky, energetic students that call WWU home. Since WWU√¢\x80\x99s enrollment is midsized (around 13,000), you will not feel lost among swarms of people and will have plenty of opportunities to get involved in student leadership that might not be presented at other, larger universities. Although you don√¢\x80\x99t get the √¢\x80\x9cbig school√¢\x80? sports craze, most students here are very athletic, and so you√¢\x80\x99re more likely to play sports than watch them here (intramurals). The Recreation Center is a great facility and I would highly encourage working out regularly. My days at Western are full, active, enjoyable days. Everything I learn inside and outside the classroom makes me glad to be here. Not to mention, Bellingham is a beautiful city with entertainment and personality that√¢\x80\x99s only 90 minutes from the bustling Seattle scene or Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'WWU√¢\x80\x99s faculty can be characterized as innovative, challenging, and accommodating. Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. They√¢\x80\x99re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers. If you ever struggle, your peers at the Tutoring Center will be right there with you to sort out whatever complicated idea you√¢\x80\x99re trying to wrap your brain around.']]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/16857,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00071-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,895341751,895203092,HORIZONTAL,"{287332=Every club you could possibly think of is at Western.

Its no fun walking through the slippery, puddled bricks on campus in tennis shoes and jeans and having to go to class sopping wet.

Being a student that speaks up in class and encourages the teacher to go further in depth is highly recommended and it shows the students understanding to the professor and gives more advantages to those students. Almost all professors encourage you to come and speak with them outside of class if you have any questions ranging from you are confused to you believe what they are saying can be challenged. I recommend talking to previous students and using rate my professor when picking what classes you enroll in because it does make a huge difference.

Other institutions say that they're green, but they ain't got nothin' on Western! Throwing away recyclable stuff is pretty much a sin here. Classes for honors students cap at about 25 students, so the likelihood of being overlooked is minimized.

The lower level classes can become quite large and reach over 200 students. Once you get into your discipline though class sizes drop dramatically and most students are able to receive some great one on one experience. With this in mind it is very important to speak up in classes.

It is situated right at the northwest corner of Washington and sits between the Ocean, Canada, and Mt. Baker which holds the world record for annual snowfall. Western fits perfectly into this atmosphere and provides the feeling of a small community within a decently sized and well respected University. The people here are very open and extremely friendly. There are a lot of very different characters around campus and embracing that diversity is a core goal at WWU.', ""Like any University, Western has it's good professor's as well as the bad ones. However, the large majority of professors here are extremely good at what they do. They are here because they love to teach, and it shows.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. They√¢¬Ä¬ôre accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers. If you ever struggle, your peers at the Tutoring Center will be right there with you to sort out whatever complicated idea you√¢¬Ä¬ôre trying to wrap your brain around.

It is a very good school, often rated as one of the best in the pacific northwest, while still being very moderately priced.

Western really encourages its students to go out into the world and do something instead of just sitting in a room listening to lectures.', ""The environment here is so homey, but still not out in the middle of nowhere. Bellingham is a lovely town with lots of things to do and places to explore and the people here are amazing. Bellingham and the campus are the types of places where you can walk down the sidewalk and smile at strangers who will smile back. And there is a place for everyone, whether you are into zombies and video games or into hiking through the woods, you will definitely be happy once you find your niche (which isn't hard)."", ""Going to WWU you'll get an all-encompassing education. Because it is a liberal arts school you get to take a little bit of everything but still get to cater to your interests. For example, you have to take some science but you can take anything from biology to astronomy. You also don't feel like just a number because the usual big lecture classes are usually only 200 or so students, which is definitely enough to feel comfortable in and talk to the teachers (who do the teaching, not TAs, and they love what they do).""]]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/16857,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,11,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00071-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,895341751,895203092,HORIZONTAL,"{287332=Every club you could possibly think of is at Western.

For those who are less eco-focused, such as myself, if you at least have an appreciation for nature or the arts, there's plenty to be had on campus."", ""Plan what classes to take during the year ahead of time when at all possible. This makes it a lot easier to see what needs to be done for your major/minor. Take a reasonable course load, not just the easy, low credit classes. A mix of difficult and easy will make the quarter easier on you and allow greater progress. This is college, expect to work hard but don't kill yourself over studies and stress. A big key part of succeeding in college is taking care of your overall health. This may sound like your mother, but she has a good point. If you do not take care of your body, you cannot perform well, and trust me, having mono during finals week is hellish. You take the extra time to give your body what it needs and you won't have two weeks of your quarter destroyed due to whatever illness is cycling through campus."", ""There are excellent teachers on campus, ones who can make a business law class seem like the most exciting thing in the world or break a complex equation down into understandable parts you can remember during tests. Taking as many credits as you can handle, from 12-18, is always good as this range has the same price. If the prospect of 18 credits is daunting, try A) taking classes in subject you know you are good at, B) Intro classes that are required for various GURs or C) taking a PE class or two to help you manage stress levels. Living off campus is highly recommended, and much more affordable, particularly Birnam Wood Apartments.There are convenient bus systems all through Bellingham that make it easy to survive without a car, also good if you live off campus. Keep in mind that if you do want to live on campus for the social aspect, you are required to get a meal plan, which depending on what you get can be more expensive then the dorm itself. If you're the outdoors type, there are many inexpensive activities you can enjoy through the Outdoor Center to keep you active and healthy. Getting used books or using the textbooks in the library can also help lower costs considerably. I've survived two quarters by borrowing half my books from friends and then helping them sell the books after I was finished. You can find good deals for books in the WWU forum, where students post books they are trying to get rid of as well as the books they are looking for."", ""I absolutely love walking around campus. Red Square is a hub of activity on sunny days and the first few weeks of each quarter.

In the late afternoon, Red Square is popular for the skateboarders on campus to cruise around without worrying about running into crowds. The campus itself is beautiful, with lots of open grass areas, wooded regions, and a wonderful view of the bay from the PAC square (another great sunbathing place). Along with it's beauty, the walk from one side of campus to the other is about 10 minutes, convenient when you have classes in different buildings.

There are excellent teachers, multiple tutor centers, and a number of useful resource offices found in the Viking Union and Old Main. For when I need to blow off steam, the Rec Center is fully equipped, and also offers various classes and sports teams one can get involved in. Sometimes tutors or exercise are more distracting then productive, so I find that a quiet place in the library (there are many, be careful to not get lost) or taking over a classroom with a study group in the evening can really help get some serious studying done, as well as have questions answered via my peers. Western allows me to both learn a great deal through classes and also how to learn outside class, a key survival skill both in college and in the real world. With all the resources at hand, WWU is very conductive to creating one's own effective study habits.

There is a rock climbing wall there and the arboretum. The bay is just down the road. Everything is withing bussing or walking distance, and they have a WONDERFUL environmental sciences program. All of the programs there are pretty superb, but all of the geology majors and environmental studies programs are great. Not to mention the teaching program. Woodring is a very good program, and several of my favorite high school teachers actually went through the program. I am excited to be applying there.', 'Definitely start off talking with the professors at the beginning of the quarters. You are always told that in books and things, but I never listened to them until about mid-way through winter quarter. This made me realize that they are actually there to help you and want you to succeed in their classes! Especially when you are struggling, they always make time for you to come in and talk to them about what you are having problems with and help you through it, and they make it easy! If you cannot go during their office hours they will make you a special appointment. This is the number one tip I can give, and also do not put off studying for the tests. Go in before your first test to the tutoring center and go talk to the study skills people to help you get the best results on your tests for yourself.', 'I think you get a quality education from very quality professors for the price you are paying. Costs are going up everywhere for schools, and Western is not in any way more or less expensive than other schools in Washington.', 'Besides the rain every day I LOVE THIS SCHOOL! Campus is beautiful. If you like the outdoors you will love it here as well. It is right next to an arboretum and it has so many out doors activities to do. The only thing that I wish I could change which would make it much more enjoyable would be for the art program. I do not know how to make a portfolio and the only way to be accepted into the art program is through applying and getting accepted or declined. This is next on my list of things to do at the university, go through and figure out how to apply and make a portfolio.', 'I would say I am learning a lot. The only things that I have problems with is matching up the right types of classes to take together. The problems I have encountered is with the math department. I am not good at math at all, and there are ways of getting help I just have not yet discovered the way to seek the help yet.

Even with the rising tuition cost, I know western is one of the lower costing colleges in Washington, but even so, they are an excellent school, and really do have teachers that are willing to focus on their students.', 'Western is located in Bellingham. Bellingham is made for the outdoors person. Personally my favorite thing to do is to go exploring. there are several beaches and parks, walks, and hikes that you can do off campus. during spring quarter, my friends and I spend most of your time at Whatcom Lake. The clubhouse rents out canoes and kayaks for $3. especially if you have never been on the water, it is something that every college student should experience. If you are not into the outdoors so much, you can always go into Fairhaven (the town, not the dooms), and walks around town. Downtown bellingham and Fairhaven are great places to eat, my personal favorite being the Boundary Bay Brewery. If you want some activities on campus there is always the rec center; open to all western students. Also western offers a wide variety of clubs from Minecraft club to Spanish club. Also you can go into the Fairhaven doors and play pool and ping-pong. basically it is really hard to be bored in Bellingham.', ""The dining halls on western's campus are no exception to the freshman 15. The food is good for the first quarter, but after a while it all tastes the same. not in a bad way, but in a typical college dining hall way."", ""I lived in Fairhaven my freshman year of college and loved it. I met my best friends there and shared a great year with the people. Western also does a Viking launch program which I participated in. This program was held for 2 weeks in Fairhaven. The experience was exceptional. Also Fairhaven isn't set up like a normal dorm; rather like wings of a house. each floor had 5 suites, and each suite had 2-4 rooms attached by a bathroom. This layout gave the door a home-like attribute to living on campus. Sophomore year my friends and I moved to Birnam Wood; the on-campus apartments. Looking back this residency had less of the community feeling that Fairhaven had. The apartment style housing was good for second and third year students who have jobs and actually study."", 'College is not mystery. Go to class, pay attention, and learn how to effectively study. Certainly the upper level classes are more time demanding, but are just as passable as the lower 100 and 200 level classes.', ""The one thing that I had to learn the hard was was try and see an academic adviser at least once each year. especially if you are like me and am not sure of your major and change it several times. They keep things in perspective for you and also keep you on track. College is expensive and its good to keep on schedule so you are not there longer than you have to be. Ans my second tip is get to know your professors. They come in handy when you need help or recommendations for programs. but most of all, the best tip I can give is to go to all your classes. only miss a day if you have to. Last quarter I had a rough patch in my life and didn't want to get out of bed. As a result I missed a lot of class periods and my grades and GPA dipped because of it."", ""Western is a science and woodring program oriented school located in beautiful Bellingham.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. They√¢¬Ä¬ôre accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. They√¢¬Ä¬ôre accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers. If you ever struggle, your peers at the Tutoring Center will be right there with you to sort out whatever complicated idea you√¢¬Ä¬ôre trying to wrap your brain around.

Despite it's reputation as a granola or hippy school, Western has one of the most diverse campuses in the state. A lot of people here are very athletic and enjoy running up to Mt. Baker to ski or snowboard in the winter, but just as many enjoy biking or hiking on any of the area trails. Also, with Bellingham Bay, the San Juan Islands, and Seattle such a short distance away, there's always something to do! Western is a very accepting community and it seems almost impossible not to fit in here! Tips for prospective students While at Western, don't be afraid to try new things! There is an information fair each fall a couple of days before school starts and all the clubs and various student organizations turn out to connect to students and get people involved in the student community. If you love sports but find that you aren't exactly varsity material, give intramural sports a try! These are student run sports teams that compete against each other throughout their season, and there's even a tournament at the end of the season to decide the season's champion.

There is an information fair each fall a couple of days before school starts and all the clubs and various student organizations turn out to connect to students and get people involved in the student community. If you love sports but find that you aren't exactly varsity material, give intramural sports a try! These are student run sports teams that compete against each other throughout their season, and there's even a tournament at the end of the season to decide the season's champion. The winner even gets The Shirt to show that he's won! Also, membership to the student rec center is included with tuition, so be sure to make the most out of that and try a class or two at the rec center. No matter your level of physical fitness, the rec center has something for everyone! Bang for the buck Having just finished my first year at Western, I can honestly say that my time there thus far has been well worth the price.

Every evening, the gigantic festive tree is a beacon from across the campus. Another tradition at Western is that during dead week, if you buy something on campus before noon, you get a receipt that gets you one dollar off of any drink you order after 2 pm.

I'd heard some horror stories about the cafeteria food at some college campuses, and I didn't want a repeat of the trashy food in high school.

The main dining hall has four stations, two which offer something new and delicious every day, one for freshly made sandwiches, and one for pizza/hamburgers, etc. There is also a full time salad and fruit bar.

If dining halls aren't your thing, though, there are several cheap restaurants and stores very close to the campus that are popular among students."", ""Most people are really friendly, it's easy to jump in with a group you've never met and hang out. Floors hold all sorts of different activities, including decoration parties (for holidays), movie nights, and late night ice cream excursions. There are also dances and socials every month.

As with any college bound student, after my first year at a university, if there was one piece of advice I could offer, it would be to attend a community college for two years and then transfer. All universities have mandatory classes that all students must take, unrelated to your major, and paying for them at a larger school is way more expensive when you could take the same classes at a community college.', 'The dining hall is pretty good, nothing special, but paying for it is rather pricey. If you live on campus, you have to have a meal plan, and even the cheapest is expensive. Here we have a buffet style dining hall, where you swipe your card once, removing one of your meals from the plan, and while you are still in the hall you can eat as much as you want. This is nice compared to other schools I have been to in that you can leave the hall full, rather than wanting more than just a tiny, overpriced meal.', ""I have been living in the least social dorms, Higginson, which has been rather dull.

The Viking Commons is the busiest dining hall because it is right near the middle of campus and serves some of the best lunch. The Ridge Commons is on The Ridge and doesn't always have the best food, but sometimes it surprises you and you have a fantastic meal! Fairhaven Commons are known to have the best food on campus and be the most acceptable to students who have food allergies and/or are gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. There are also multiple small stores on campus which sell food, snacks, and coffee! The soups at these stores are some of the best soups I've ever had! They have really good coffee, also."", 'There are three types of dorms at Western, The Ridge, North Campus, and Fairhaven. The Ridge is located up in the trees a little bit above campus and would be known as the party dorms. There are different types of dorms on the ridge. Beta and Gamma are suite-style dorms (4 rooms all sharing one bathroom) and Kappa, Omega, Sigma, and Highland Hall are all hall style dorms. Living on the ridge gives you a little bit of a workout because you have to walk up hills to get back to your room usually. North Campus consists of five dorms, Mathes, Nash, and Higginson, Edens Hall, and Edens North. Edens Hall is the honors dorms for students who are admitted for honors classes and all four of the other dorms are hall style. Those who live on North Campus are very close to campus and say they have a very close connection with everyone on their floor and everyone they live close too. Fairhaven is on south campus and completely immersed in trees and wilderness. It is a slightly far walk from campus but those who live there say they love it and most buildings are a mixture of hall style and suite-style dorms. Some refer to this part of campus as hippie.', 'Dependent on what classes you take, the difficulty level can vary. Most first year (level 100) classes will be fairly straightforward and easy to complete with a passing grade (C or higher). Also the difficulty of the classes depends on what type of class it is. A math class may be harder than an english class, while a history class may be easier than a science class. It also depends on what you like, if you enjoy math and science the struggle you may have to face passing those classes may be worth it. My advice is to take classes that look interesting to you and that ignite your curiosity.', ""Western Washington University is a relaxing environment with professors who want you to succeed. The outdoors are a big part of Western's appearance and mean a lot to many people who teach and study here.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. They√¢¬Ä¬ôre accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers.

Some of the required classes you take for your major also cover your university required subjects. Do not room with your friends!

Make sure you make a friend in every single class. It helps when you miss class to have someone who you can get notes from, and believe me, you will miss class.

Even though you must learn to fend for yourself and are put up to the task to create a whole new routine to your new life, the dorm life at Western helps guide you tremendously along the way. The dorms are filled with wonderful people and not to mention the hygiene is maintained by the lovely janitors that clean twice a day.', 'Even though I am only a freshman at this school, and I have yet to complete two more quarters for this year, I have some good insight on the academic rigor of this school. The academic rigor at this school is challenging and broadening of the mind. The professors and grad students that teach the courses are very passionate about their subjects and care for the growth of the student body. Even if you are not trying to major in a certain subject class that you are taking, the professors and grad students make sure you understand the concepts in the class so that the student can take full advantage of the college expereince.', 'One thing that Western requires of you as a student as does most colleges, is some independence. Western is a school that contains all of the most important and vital resources, but the student must train themselves to utilize these resources and their independence in the most effective equilibirium to help them become successfull. This may sound like a bit of a struggle, but once you have figured out how to perform this task successfully, you feel your mind growing and creating synapses that you had no idea existed.', 'On a scale of one to ten I would rate Western Washington University a 8. The reason that this rating is a 8 and not 10, is because no college is absolutley perfect. As I have sat back and observed this college there are some minor changes I would make if I was in charge.']]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/16857,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,135,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00071-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,895341751,895203092,HORIZONTAL,"{287332=Every club you could possibly think of is at Western.

There is no Greek life, so there aren't as many parties to choose from as other universities, but they will be very popular and upbeat! Many hosts choose a theme for their parties which is fun, too. The thing I didn't like about the parties was that they were more about more damaging drugs than alcohol. BEWARE: Due to a riot that formed out of a huge house party a few years ago, cops bust up almost every party before it gets crazy. Hipsters are all over campus! The northwest has always been the best home to hipsters. WWU has your original hipsters, lumberjack hipsters, Nordstrom hipsters, and your Macklemore hipsters!"", ""During the first week of school, there is an undie run where everyone strips down to their underwear and runs on campus to the fountain at dark. Many students don't know that this is actually a charity where you are supposed to literally take the clothes off of your back and give them to people in need. Very few students donate, but very many strip! WWU has no football team, but they do have a very talented Quidditch team! Also, clothing is OPTIONAL on campus. Seriously, this is not a joke."", ""WWU includes extra fees in the tuition to cover a bus pass and a membership to the rec center. It's nice to have those things, but really, you paid for it.

I recommend The Bagelry, Old Town Cafe, and HOMESKILLET!', 'I absolutely hate the dining hall at WWU. I wish I could give it zero stars. I am vegan and ate animal products ten times (that I know of) over two quarters due to false labeling. They throw out vegetarian and vegan labels on their foods regardless if they are or not. They also put out incorrect ingredients lists on many of their items. BEWARE if you have allergies, moral, or religious concerns with your diet.

After you complete the GURs, your classes level out to 20-50 students. My advice to you is balance work and play! I definitely worked harder than I played and did not explore all that Bellingham had to offer. One bonus tip for studying is to check out the Harry Potter room on the fourth floor of the library!

The following table explains what's the purpose of the most common locations and should provide a guideline on where to store the contents of your application. Linux File System Layout The two more common pseudo-file systems are procfs, and sysfs. More information on these can be found on the next section. Linux has several pseudo file systems that when mounted don't reflect actual stored files on some memory device, but file handlers that can provide information about the system, a process, a driver, etc. This pseudo file systems generate the file entries and contents dynamically, based on the system status. Pseudo file systems Unix file system layout is also important, as there are standard locations for configuration files, shared libraries, binaries, shared data, etc. Following the Unix mindset, most of the computer universe is represented like a file: files are data containers for more than binary executable files or raw data stored on memory devices, files are also used to represent device drivers, interprocess pipes, or system status. Linux file system is based on Unix file system concepts, and therefore it is composed of a tree of files that are located on some physical storage. The physical storage should provide the root of the tree (the root file system) and other devices can be √¢¬Ä¬úmounted√¢¬Ä? at directories in the file system tree. The","Embedded Linux File System The standard Linux file system is designed for use by more than one person at a time. This is rarely the case on an embedded device, so the difference between /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /opt may seem less useful than for standard desktop computing purposes. However one of the important uses of this separation is that it simplifies the final layout of the file systems used by the embedded target. RidgeRun applies the following rules to decide where to locate the applications: /bin, /sbin: minimal binaries to boot the system /usr/bin, /usr/sbin: standard Linux applications that are not required to boot the system /opt: customer applications This layout allows for different mount points to be used for the /usr and /opt directories which in turn allows: Creating smaller minimal root file system to speed up booting (depends on the file system technology used), or using a read only file system. Simplifying software upgrades Security analysis is simplified if suspect activities are limited to a small part of the file system. Embedded target file system RidgeRun SDK creates the target file system on the Linux host machine, and processes it to create the proper target file system image to be downloaded (if required) to the embedded system. The file system of the target system is found under the base (referred to as $DEVDIR) of your SDK: $(DEVDIR)/fs/fs. This",False,-1,0,,
