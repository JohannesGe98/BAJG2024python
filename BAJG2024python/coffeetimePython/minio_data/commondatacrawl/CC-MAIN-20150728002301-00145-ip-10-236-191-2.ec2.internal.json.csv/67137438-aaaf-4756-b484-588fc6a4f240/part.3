Lyceums are just presentations, recitals, sermons, and guest speakers, and events that each student has to attend to. There are five different categories that each student must have eight lyceums in: faith, growth, lecture, art and electives. It is not too hard and I have enjoyed many of the lyceums i have attended already as a freshman. Our lake that is specific to students and teachers at this school is also different to most other schools and it is definitely an amazing place to go.

About 80% of students are athletes and so a lot of their time is spent playing sports. A lot of students also play on intramural teams, whether they play a varsity sport or not. We have multiple types of intramural sports available for anyone to participate in year round. Also, we have Greek Life which most of the students participate in it seems like. I see people representing their sororities and fraternities all around school showing their school spirit. Many 5K's are hosted through the school every couple of weeks. Lastly, there are many outdoor activities to participate in as well. We have an on campus pond, lake, open fields, disc golf, sidewalks to run on, hiking/biking trails, and soon there will be canoes on the lake available for students to use."", ""There are four different places to eat right now on campus and there is also a cafe scheduled to be built in the next year. The cafeteria has great food but it can sometimes be repetitive and it feels like the same meals are being served a little two often. We also have the Klondike which is more of a fast food place to eat and it goes along with the students meal plan which I love. We have Einsteins and Subway as well on campus which you can use bulldog bucks for but are not permitted to use meal swipes. Lastly, there is the Lakeside Cafe being built within the next year made to be something like a TGI Friday's. There will be one meal a week that students can use the meal swipe for which is great."", ""I love the dorm life here.We have three different dorm buildings, one suite like building, and the rest are on campus apartments. Each of the buildings have been updated and modernized. The size of the rooms are large as well and all students seem to love where they are staying. The only thing that can sometimes be a negative factor, is noise. No dorm room anywhere is going to be completely soundproof. There are people above or below you and living all around you so there is always going to be noise. However, this has never really affected me here and I think it's also a thing we adapt to after living in college for a while."", ""The classes in college are always going to be more difficult than in high school. However there are more resources at Wingate to help you pick up your grade in classes that may be a struggle for certain people. It's also a little harder because no one is in the dorm room forcing someone to do their homework and so it takes self determination and motivation to get the work done. The classes are possible to do well in and the teachers seem to be always willing to help and give extra credit."", ""1. Be aware that at any college, classes will be harder than they were in high school, you will be away from home for a while, and you'll have to make smart decisions on you're own. 2. Be involved in order to meet new people, make new friends, and fell involved with the school. 3. Use the free resources given to each student. Such as, the writing center to help you write papers, tutors, and your professor for the class you need help in. If you need help, do not be afraid to ask. 4. Do well throughout school because it will pay off, the higher your GPA and rank, the better your living conditions will be for the next year."", 'This school is great and has a beautiful location, great scenery, and very friendly, welcoming people.

The people in charge of campus safety certainly do a fine job of ensuring that each student is taken care of and feels secure in this environment.', ""While Wingate University is a private institution, many people think that the price is unreasonable. I completely disagree. Wingate offers outstanding scholarships to new and incoming students that are renewable every year. I've known students who have received $10,000 and $13,000 scholarships! Also, take into consideration the value of going to school here. Students are in much smaller classes as compared to public universities and get to work one on one with their professor when needed. All in all, it's a pretty good deal. Wingate was even ranked #6 of Best Value Colleges in the south!"", ""Wingate offers many activities on campus for students to get involved and have a fun time. With three pools, a lake, and sports taking place, it's easy to find something to do! Wingate offers concerts as well as lyceums which open our minds to new ideas. Just the other day a comedian visited our campus and delivered a show in the Batte Center."", 'At Wingate, there are many dining choices to choose from. The cafeteria offers many different selections such as grilled food, a salad bar, pasta, pizzas, homemade dishes, a fruit bar, and a good selection of desserts if so desire.', ""Only as a freshman are you required to live in the dorms. Once you become a sophomore or upperclassman, you are able to reside in the on-campus apartments. However, the RA's and CA's truly care for the students and are willing to help in any way possible."", 'Here at Wingate, classes are relatively small, which allows professors to interact one on one with students. The courses may be tough at times but professors are willing to work with you if you need additional help. Also, tutoring is free!', ""Take advantage of everything that Wingate offers. Anyone can find something on campus to get involved in, whether it is sports, Greek life, community service, etc. Also, look into the W'International program. Studying abroad is certainly a wonderful opportunity and here at Wingate, you can chose where in the world you want to visit!"", ""Wingate University is an excellent place to pursue a higher education.

The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.

For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes.

In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage.

It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations.

Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges.

If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital.

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.
