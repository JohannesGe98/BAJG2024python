These were envisaged to replace the existing vacuum-braked fleet which had been in decline since the latter days of steam. To ensure that the presence of air-braked vehicles was well known, British Rail was keen to implement the brand name Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™Air Braked FreightÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™, but after lengthy discussions and board meetings, Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™SpeedlinkÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ was finally selected. Speedlink was what could be considered a Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™traditionalÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ freight operation: individual wagons originated from various separate localities and were shunted into a single train. Subsequently, when this full train load reached a Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™routing pointÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™, the wagons would again disperse to their separate destinations. This service was faster than existing freights, had a higher haulage capacity, and huge marshalling yards were not pivotal to the operation. Despite the distinctive brand name, Speedlink was still under the auspices of the general Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™RailfreightÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ division, this of which received its own distinguishing red, yellow and grey livery as part of the sectorisation process of 4th January 1982. Excepting cosmetic re-branding, such as the 1986 emergence of Network SouthEast, the passenger sectors remained unchanged, but significant divisions were to be made as far as Railfreight was concerned. On 15th October 1987, the TrainLoad Business Sectors were formed; these specialised in petroleum, coal, metals and construction. On 10th October of the following year, the operations of Speedlink and Freightliner were merged under the then new brand of Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™Railfreight DistributionÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™. Demarcation of traffic into sectors was undertaken to make the prospect of freight by rail more attractive to potential customers, whilst also improving performance and efficiency. British Rail was also being prepared for the envisaged traffic generated as a result of the Channel Tunnel opening. The Speedlink service eventually served nineteen cities and Railfreight DistributionÃ¢Â€Â™s (RfD) headquarters had settled in ''Tournament House'', at the rear of Paddington station.

When Freightliner}","The origins of this Business Sector can be traced back to 1977, when the first air-braked wagons came into service. These were envisaged to replace the existing vacuum-braked fleet which had been in decline since the latter days of steam. To ensure that the presence of air-braked vehicles was well known, British Rail was keen to implement the brand name Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™Air Braked FreightÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™, but after lengthy discussions and board meetings, Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™SpeedlinkÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ was finally selected. Speedlink was what could be considered a Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™traditionalÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ freight operation: individual wagons originated from various separate localities and were shunted into a single train. Subsequently, when this full train load reached a Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™routing pointÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™, the wagons would again disperse to their separate destinations. This service was faster than existing freights, had a higher haulage capacity, and huge marshalling yards were not pivotal to the operation. Despite the distinctive brand name, Speedlink was still under the auspices of the general Ã¢Â€Â˜Ã¢Â€Â™RailfreightÃ¢Â€Â™Ã¢Â€Â™ division, this of which received its own distinguishing red, yellow and grey livery as part of the sectorisation process of 4th January 1982. Excepting cosmetic re-branding, such as the 1986 emergence of Network SouthEast, the passenger sectors remained unchanged, but significant divisions were to be made as far as Railfreight was concerned. On 15th October 1987, the TrainLoad Business Sectors were formed; these specialised in petroleum, coal, metals and construction. On 10th October of the following year, the operations of Speedlink and Freightliner were merged under the then new brand","Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Although established to be a profitable venture for BR, Speedlink made considerable losses each year, which saw its total withdrawal in 1991, by which time RfD still had the Freightliner traffic and was also handling general commodity flows. In September 1992, at the Birmingham Exhibition, the Business Sector unveiled its plans to run international freights via the Channel Tunnel, which was planned to open to regular traffic on 6th May 1994.

Listening to music performed by fine professional musicians while seated at small candlelit tables was a concept perfectly suited to the intimacy of the Lodge. Adding to that the attraction of having wonderful desserts from which to choose and the Coffeehouse caught on immediately. It became a regular series run by a musiciansÃ¢Â€Â™ cooperative, which made the musical and operational decisions.While seven Coffeehouse concerts were presented the first year, the number tapered off to two a year as the coop found that other musical commitments made it impossible to organize that many concerts. The Valentine Coffeehouse remained and was particularly popular.For 28 years, the Coffeehouse was the place to meet friends and hear beautiful music. We gave 112 concerts attended by an estimated 13,000 people.But now the time has come to say goodbye. The Coffeehouse has closed its doors for the last time. Heartfelt thanks to Los Alamos for all the love and support we have received over the years and hope the Coffeehouse at Fuller Lodge will be long remembered as a cherished part of the history of this community.Patricia Broxton, Rosalie Heller and Kay NewnamLos Alamos, 25480=The Los Alamos Monitor | lacirculation@lamonitor.com | 505-662-4185 256 DP Road, Los Alamos, NM 87544 Office Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 33158=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2015}","Ã‚Â» Ã‚Â  February Ã‚Â« Ã‚Â  EVENTS CALENDAR }); googletag.display(""gam-holder-075-NP-300x60"");",Upcoming Events Home News Business/Economy Public Safety Courts Education Los Alamos National Laboratory Around the Area Sports Local State National Opinion Columns Letters Readers Forum Blogs Obituaries Features Milestones Announcements Religion Science/Technology Entertainment Teen Pulse TV Listings Reader Content Special Sections Classifieds Business for Sale Homes.com Place an Ad Local Classifieds Public Notices,False,-1,0,"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:59:33 +0000",

I wish I had pics of Joanne's yarn - she made two marvelous skeins using these really rich gold-orange-red-brown autumnal colors. She got the best results of the three of us. I think she ended up hooked on spinning, too. For my first skein, I applied a dark green and didn't really like it once it hit the yarn, so the teacher suggested trying to rinse some of it out. An unexpected result was that some of the green wicked up into the undyed areas and turned into an almost celadon color, and I started liking it a lot more (skein 3, attached). So I repeated the process in two more spots and added the slightest touches of a burnt orange color. Finally, I used some of Tony's left over purple and red for the last skein, along with some sapphire blue, and then added a touch of the blue to the soaking tub and dunked the skein in it for just a moment or two (skein 4 in the attached) to achieve an overall wash. My hubby Tony came along and our friend Joanne joined us, and we all had a blast. The three of us each dyed two hanks. Tony used really saturated blocks of blue, purple, red, green and a deep gray-brown color. (See skeins 1 and 2 in the attached pics.)

Regardless of the version you choose, the cabin is best described as Ã¢Â€Âœintimate.Ã¢Â€? Leg room is ample, and head room is sufficient for most, but those broad of shoulder or wide of hip may find the carÃ¢Â€Â™s accommodations to be sub-optimal. There isnÃ¢Â€Â™t much onboard storage space, and while the trunk is large enough to be functional, the exhaust routing means that you wonÃ¢Â€Â™t be hauling perishable items in it. While the gullwing doors may be iconic, they donÃ¢Â€Â™t necessarily permit easy entry for taller or shorter drivers. Taller drivers will almost certainly smash their heads into the doors on entry (or exit), while shorter drivers may not be able to reach the doorÃ¢Â€Â™s handle when seated. As with any car, these are things youÃ¢Â€Â™ll get accustomed to, but the roadster variantÃ¢Â€Â™s conventional doors eliminates these problems outright. DonÃ¢Â€Â™t let the luxurious accommodations fool you into thinking that the SLS AM GT is just another Grand Touring car with a suspension thatÃ¢Â€Â™s too soft",Gallery Photos (56),True,0,0,,

Allopregnanolone, a key metabolite of progesterone, has neuroprotective and developmental effects in the brain. The objectives of this study were to measure the neuroactive steroid concentrations following preterm delivery in a neonatal guinea pig model and assess the potential for postnatal progesterone replacement therapy to affect neuroactive steroid brain and plasma concentrations in preterm neonates. Methods: Preterm (62-63 days) and term (69 days) guinea pig pups were delivered by cesarean section and tissue was collected at 24 hours. Plasma progesterone, cortisol, allopregnanolone, and brain allopregnanolone concentrations were measured by immunoassay. Brain 5a-reductase (5aR) expression was determined by Western blot. Neurodevelopmental maturity of preterm neonates was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining for myelination, glial cells, and neurons. Results: Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were significantly reduced after birth in both preterm and term neonates. Postnatal progesterone treatment in preterm neonates increased brain and plasma allopregnanolone concentrations. Preterm neonates had reduced myelination, low birth weight, and high mortality compared to term neonates. Brain 5aR expression was also significantly reduced in neonates compared to fetal expression. Conclusions: Delivery results in a loss of neuroactive steroid concentrations resulting in a premature reduction in brain allopregnanolone in preterm neonates. Postnatal progesterone therapy reestablished neuroactive steroid levels in preterm brains, a finding that has implications for postnatal growth following preterm birth that occurs at a time of neurodevelopmental immaturity. ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2013 The Author(s)., 8947=Excessive vasodilatation during the perinatal period is associated with cardiorespiratory instability in preterm neonates. Little evidence of the mechanisms controlling microvascular tone during circulatory transition exists. We hypothesised that hydrogen sulphide (H2S), an important regulator of microvascular reactivity and central cardiac function in adults and animal models, may contribute to the vasodilatation observed in preterm newborns. Term and preterm neonates (24-43 weeks gestational age) were studied. Peripheral microvascular blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler. Thiosulphate, a urinary metabolite of H2S, was determined by high performance liquid chromatography as a measure of 24 hr total body H2S turnover for the first 3 days of postnatal life. H2S turnover was greatest in very preterm infants and decreased with increasing gestational age (p = 0.0001). H2S turnover was stable across the first 72 hrs of life in older neonates. In very preterm neonates, H2S turnover increased significantly from day 1 to 3 (p = 0.0001); and males had higher H2S turnover than females (p = 0.04). A significant relationship between microvascular blood flow and H2S turnover was observed on day 2 of postnatal life (p = 0.0004). H2S may play a role in maintaining microvascular tone in the perinatal period. Neonates at the greatest risk of microvascular dysfunction characterised by inappropriate peripheral vasodilatation - very preterm male neonates - are also the neonates with highest levels of total body H2S turnover suggesting that overproduction of this gasotransmitter may contribute to microvascular dysfunction in preterms. Potentially, H2S is a target to selectively control microvascular tone in the circulation of newborns. ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2014 Dyson et al., 14906=Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain. 5a-Pregnane-3a-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid during foetal life, although other 3a-hydroxy- pregnanes may make an additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective mechanism. Allopregnanolone has a trophic role in regulating development, maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain. Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Pregnancy and steroids ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved., 121801=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia, 20795=Placental 5a-reductase (5aR) is influenced by in utero compromises and has a role in regulating neuroactive steroid concentrations in the fetus. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in placental 5aR were associated with neonatal outcome after birth. Guinea pigs were delivered by cesarean section at term (GA69, n=22) or preterm (GA62, n=36) and the placenta collected. Preterm neonates were maintained for 24 h unless their condition deteriorated before this time. Enzyme mRNA expression of 5aR type-1 and 5aR type-2 were determined using real-time PCR. All preterm neonates had significantly higher 5aR2 expression in their placenta compared with placentae from term neonates (P<0.0001). Expression was also markedly higher in the placentae from neonates that did not survive until 24 h, compared with surviving preterm neonates (P=0.04). These findings suggest differences of in utero neurosteroidogenic capacity between surviving and non-surviving preterm guinea pig neonates. The increased 5aR2 mRNA expression in the placenta of non-survivors suggests an induction of the neurosteroid pathway due to prior exposure to an in utero compromise, with such exposure possibly a predisposing factor that contributed to their poor ex utero outcome.

Allopregnanolone, a key metabolite of progesterone, has neuroprotective and developmental effects in the brain. The objectives of this study were to measure the neuroactive steroid concentrations following preterm delivery in a neonatal guinea pig model and assess the potential for postnatal progesterone replacement therapy to affect neuroactive steroid brain and plasma concentrations in preterm neonates. Methods: Preterm (62-63 days) and term (69 days) guinea pig pups were delivered by cesarean section and tissue was collected at 24 hours. Plasma progesterone, cortisol, allopregnanolone, and brain allopregnanolone concentrations were measured by immunoassay. Brain 5a-reductase (5aR) expression was determined by Western blot. Neurodevelopmental maturity of preterm neonates was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining for myelination, glial cells, and neurons. Results: Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were significantly reduced after birth in both preterm and term neonates. Postnatal progesterone treatment in preterm neonates increased brain and plasma allopregnanolone concentrations. Preterm neonates had reduced myelination, low birth weight, and high mortality compared to term neonates. Brain 5aR expression was also significantly reduced in neonates compared to fetal expression. Conclusions: Delivery results in a loss of neuroactive steroid concentrations resulting in a premature reduction in brain allopregnanolone in preterm neonates. Postnatal progesterone therapy reestablished neuroactive steroid levels in preterm brains, a finding that has implications for postnatal growth following preterm birth that occurs at a time of neurodevelopmental immaturity. ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2013 The Author(s)., 8947=Excessive vasodilatation during the perinatal period is associated with cardiorespiratory instability in preterm neonates. Little evidence of the mechanisms controlling microvascular tone during circulatory transition exists. We hypothesised that hydrogen sulphide (H2S), an important regulator of microvascular reactivity and central cardiac function in adults and animal models, may contribute to the vasodilatation observed in preterm newborns. Term and preterm neonates (24-43 weeks gestational age) were studied. Peripheral microvascular blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler. Thiosulphate, a urinary metabolite of H2S, was determined by high performance liquid chromatography as a measure of 24 hr total body H2S turnover for the first 3 days of postnatal life. H2S turnover was greatest in very preterm infants and decreased with increasing gestational age (p = 0.0001). H2S turnover was stable across the first 72 hrs of life in older neonates. In very preterm neonates, H2S turnover increased significantly from day 1 to 3 (p = 0.0001); and males had higher H2S turnover than females (p = 0.04). A significant relationship between microvascular blood flow and H2S turnover was observed on day 2 of postnatal life (p = 0.0004). H2S may play a role in maintaining microvascular tone in the perinatal period. Neonates at the greatest risk of microvascular dysfunction characterised by inappropriate peripheral vasodilatation - very preterm male neonates - are also the neonates with highest levels of total body H2S turnover suggesting that overproduction of this gasotransmitter may contribute to microvascular dysfunction in preterms. Potentially, H2S is a target to selectively control microvascular tone in the circulation of newborns. ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2014 Dyson et al., 14906=Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain. 5a-Pregnane-3a-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid during foetal life, although other 3a-hydroxy- pregnanes may make an additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective mechanism. Allopregnanolone has a trophic role in regulating development, maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain. Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Pregnancy and steroids ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to determine if changes in placental 5aR were associated with neonatal outcome after birth. Guinea pigs were delivered by cesarean section at term (GA69, n=22) or preterm (GA62, n=36) and the placenta collected. Preterm neonates were maintained for 24 h unless their condition deteriorated before this time. Enzyme mRNA expression of 5aR type-1 and 5aR type-2 were determined using real-time PCR. All preterm neonates had significantly higher 5aR2 expression in their placenta compared with placentae from term neonates (P<0.0001). Expression was also markedly higher in the placentae from neonates that did not survive until 24 h, compared with surviving preterm neonates (P=0.04). These findings suggest differences of in utero neurosteroidogenic capacity between surviving and non-surviving preterm guinea pig neonates. The increased 5aR2 mRNA expression in the placenta of non-survivors suggests an induction of the neurosteroid pathway due to prior exposure to an in utero compromise, with such exposure possibly a predisposing factor that contributed to their poor ex utero outcome.

Candy Best Book of March * One of More Magazine's ""Five Thrillers Not to Read After Dark"" When Dr. John Taylor turns up dead in a hotel room, the local police uncover enough incriminating evidence to suspect foul play. Detective Samantha Adams, whose Palo Alto beat usually covers petty crimes, is innocently thrown into a high-profile case that is more complicated than any she has faced before. A renowned reconstructive surgeon and a respected family man, Dr. Taylor was beloved and admired. But beneath his perfect faÃƒÂ§ade was a hidden life--in fact, multiple lives. Dr. Taylor was married to three very different women in three separate cities. As the circumstances surrounding his death emerge, Detective Adams finds herself tracking down a murderer through a tangled web of marital deception and revenge. New York Times bestselling author Alice LaPlante's haunting and complex novel of family secrets dissects--with scalpel-like agility--the intricacies of desire and commitment, trust and jealousy.}"

Couple that with his career Triple-A numbers (2.14 ERA, 131 strikeouts in 126.1 innings) and you'll understand why the D-Backs coveted him when they were a part of the three-team trade that also brought Edwin Jackson to the desert in December. Kennedy is expected to take over the No. 4 starter spot for his new team., 86373=Kennedy made strides in his second full season with the D-Backs and solidified his place as the ace of the team's rotation. In addition to pushing his strikeout rate to 8.0 K/9IP, Kennedy's control improved to his Triple-A levels from 2008. Don't expect him to consistently maintain a sub-3.00 ERA while pitching half of his games at Chase Field, but Kennedy has a five-pitch arsenal including a very good two-seam fastball that mitigates some of the risk he presents as a flyball pitcher. The growth he showed in 2011 is largely sustainable as even a regression back toward his 2010 home-run rate (1.2 HR/9IP) will yield limited fallout since he's proven capable of missing bats a good clip and limiting the free passes., 81878=5/24/2015, 85538=2013, 88109=2010, 58567=2015 Stat Review for IanÃ‚Â Kennedy Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  As compared to the top 100 starting pitchers in 2014 (min 145 in), 84645=Subscribe now to see our 2015 outlook., 89569=2008, 86321=2012, 88793=Kennedy had an opportunity to stake a permanent claim for a rotation spot with the Yankees when the team was ravaged by injuries last season, but a strained lat knocked him out of action from late May until early August, and he didn't pitch well enough around the injury to stick when he was finally healthy for good later in the year. After being demoted back to Triple-A, Kennedy was very sharp while he finished with a 72:17 K:BB ratio over 69 innings there. The Yankees' offseason free-agent spending binge seems to suggest that Kennedy might be traded to another organization, which would likely provide a much faster track to the majors. Keeper league owners should patiently wait for the change of scenery to take place., 84593=2015, 75575=7/11/2015, 58042=Age is determined on July 1st of each season.

Kennedy didn't make the Yankees' postseason roster because of a late-season back ailment, but in his three big league starts, he showed considerable poise in high-pressure situations with the Yankees chasing down a playoff berth in September. It's possible that a numbers crunch will bump Kennedy back to Triple-A to start the season, but look for him to spend most of his season in New York, especially if Chamberlain stays in the bullpen., 87143=2011, 74672=7/21/2015, 84818=Just two seasons removed from consideration for the National League Cy Young award, Kennedy's walk and strikeout rates had reversed course to career worsts in his four years as a full-time starter -- 7.8 K/9 and 3.5 BB/9 -- before the Diamondbacks dealt the righty to San Diego at the July 31 trade deadline. Both marks actually bumped up with his new squad, but an exchange of the launching pad that is Chase Field for cavernous Petco Park resulted in a fair 4.24 ERA in 57.1 innings (10 starts) as a Padre. Considering his career line in the latter venue -- 90:27 K:BB ratio and .198 BAA in 71 frames -- a bounce-back campaign could be in the offing for the 29-year-old., 83667=5/6/2015, 76481=7/5/2015, 84766=2014, 88741=2009, 87195=Of the D-Backs starters that were on the roster from April through October, Kennedy was the most consistent from start to finish. The Yankees were never willing to give him a legitimate chance to stick in their rotation, but he survived his first full big league campaign at age 25 and surprisingly racked up 194 innings over 32 starts after a shoulder aneurysm limited him to 23.2 innings in 2009. Kennedy missed enough bats (7.8 K/9IP) to survive serving up 26 long balls and issuing his fair share of free passes (3.3 BB/9IP). If you look closely, a .265 BABIP reveals at least some good fortune behind the sub-4.00 ERA and it's easy to see where his 4.33 FIP might be more telling of what to expect in his second season with Arizona, but there were signs of growth in the second half including a drop in home-run rate (0.76 HR/9IP) and fewer walks (3.1 BB/9IP)., 79196=6/18/2015, 77403=6/30/2015, 82773=5/17/2015, 80985=5/29/2015, 78299=6/25/2015, 18538=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Jump To:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â–Â¼ Advanced Stats, 85590=Although Kennedy was able to carry similar peripherals to his breakout 2011 season (8.1 K/9, 2.4 BB/9), the results included an ERA that was more than a run higher and a home-run rate that swung back to his 2010 level (1.2 HR/9).

If you look closely, a .265 BABIP reveals at least some good fortune behind the sub-4.00 ERA and it's easy to see where his 4.33 FIP might be more telling of what to expect in his second season with Arizona, but there were signs of growth in the second half including a drop in home-run rate (0.76 HR/9IP) and fewer walks (3.1 BB/9IP)., 79196=6/18/2015, 77403=6/30/2015, 82773=5/17/2015, 80985=5/29/2015, 78299=6/25/2015, 18538=Age is determined on July 1st of each season.

A closer look at Kennedy's arsenal reveals that opposing hitters made more powerful contact against three of his four pitches, including his four-seam fastball (.291 BAA, .511 SLGA). Pitching half of his games at Chase Field, Kennedy's flyball tendencies will be more damaging than they would be elsewhere, but his walk rate appears to have stabilized at a strong enough point where the 2012 line is a baseline for his overall performance going forward., 80083=6/8/2015}",Vs.

His favorite pastime is complaining about everything and everyone. Nothing is good enough for him. He delights in the misfortunes of others. Apparently, their misery makes him feel superior in some misguided, muddle-headed way. This juvenile ""I'm-better-than-you-are"" need in him stems from his youth, before he became a Decepticon. At that time he was little more than a gangly collection of circuits and servo-motors, performing a menial janitorial function in the Fuel-Spill Section of the Ministry of Energy and Nutrition on Cybertron. More robust fellow workers mocked his feeble physique and bullied him. Feeling alienated from and hatred of established society, Crankcase eagerly joined the Decepticons when they began their war against the Autobots. Megatron himself rebuilt Crankcase to give him increased bulk and strength. Crankcase's first action in his new body was to attack the Ministry of Energy and Nutrition. Millions of years later, the fuel spill he caused has yet to be fully cleaned up. Abilities: Crankcase has a vast data storage capacity. His memory can contain 400 trillion trillion bits of information, which are encoded in patterns of light within microscopic crystal matrices.

Polyprotein processing intermediates such as VP0 which is a VP4-VP2 precursor are produced. During virion maturation, non-infectious particles are rendered infectious following cleavage of VP0. This maturation cleavage is followed by a conformational change of the particle. The polyprotein seems to be cotranslationally cleaved at the 2A/2B junction by a ribosomal skip from one codon to the next without formation of a peptide bond. This process would release the L-P1-2A peptide from the translational complex (By similarity).By similarity Myristoylation of VP4 is required during RNA encapsidation and formation of the mature virus particle.By similarity <p>UniProtKB Keywords constitute a <a target=""_top"" href=""/keywords"">controlled vocabulary</a> with a hierarchical structure.

The first objective of this project is to understand the effects on lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle lipid composition, insulin signaling, and inflammatory signaling of two common variations in FA composition of the diet: (1) The typical intake of North America where PA and OA are present in equal proportions (HI PA diet). (2) The Mediterranean FA composition in which PA is much lower and OA much higher (HI OA diet). PA may induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells via its accumulation in lipids within muscle cells and via activation of inflammatory signaling. The second objective of this project is to assess the hypothesis that a high intake of PA will down-regulate its own one-carbon (initial) oxidation, leading to increased inflammatory signaling and decreased insulin signaling. However, there is literature evidence that FA may induce defects in insulin signaling, if FA are not completely oxidized; therefore, the third objective is to assess the hypotheses that a high PA diet may decrease complete oxidation of FA and possibly accelerate initial FA oxidation.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga. Am Ende der Saison 1973/74 war man jedoch wieder abgestiegen, und zwar in die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete 2. Bundesliga., 67947=Die Nachwuchsabteilung des Vereins galt jahrelang als grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Nachwuchsabteilung Deutschlands, der zeitweise 27 Mannschaften angehÃƒÂ¶rten. In der Saison 2006/07 spielten bei den B-MÃƒÂ¤dchen gleich drei Nationalspielerinnen: Isabelle Linden, Sara Doorsoun-Khajec (beide Deutschland U-17) und Arzu Karabulut (TÃƒÂ¼rkei)., 62851=Von 1967 bis 1978 fanden die Heimspiele des Vereins im MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion statt. Die Heimspiele der gemeinsamen Bundesliga-Saison 1973/74 mussten der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln und der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in der benachbarten MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Radrennbahn austragen.}","Saisondaten 1963Ã¢Â€Â“1969 Stand ewige Tabelle: 1. Liga: Platz 47 (von 52) Ã¢Â€Â“ 1 Spielzeit 2.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga. Am Ende der Saison 1973/74 war man jedoch wieder abgestiegen, und zwar in die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete 2. Bundesliga., 67947=Die Nachwuchsabteilung des Vereins galt jahrelang als grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Nachwuchsabteilung Deutschlands, der zeitweise 27 Mannschaften angehÃƒÂ¶rten. In der Saison 2006/07 spielten bei den B-MÃƒÂ¤dchen gleich drei Nationalspielerinnen: Isabelle Linden, Sara Doorsoun-Khajec (beide Deutschland U-17) und Arzu Karabulut (TÃƒÂ¼rkei)., 62851=Von 1967 bis 1978 fanden die Heimspiele des Vereins im MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion statt. Die Heimspiele der gemeinsamen Bundesliga-Saison 1973/74 mussten der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln und der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in der benachbarten MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Radrennbahn austragen.}","Saisondaten 1963Ã¢Â€Â“1969 Stand ewige Tabelle: 1. Liga: Platz 47 (von 52) Ã¢Â€Â“ 1 Spielzeit 2.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga. Am Ende der Saison 1973/74 war man jedoch wieder abgestiegen, und zwar in die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete 2. Bundesliga., 67947=Die Nachwuchsabteilung des Vereins galt jahrelang als grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Nachwuchsabteilung Deutschlands, der zeitweise 27 Mannschaften angehÃƒÂ¶rten. In der Saison 2006/07 spielten bei den B-MÃƒÂ¤dchen gleich drei Nationalspielerinnen: Isabelle Linden, Sara Doorsoun-Khajec (beide Deutschland U-17) und Arzu Karabulut (TÃƒÂ¼rkei)., 62851=Von 1967 bis 1978 fanden die Heimspiele des Vereins im MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion statt. Die Heimspiele der gemeinsamen Bundesliga-Saison 1973/74 mussten der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln und der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in der benachbarten MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Radrennbahn austragen.}","Saisondaten 1963Ã¢Â€Â“1969 Stand ewige Tabelle: 1. Liga: Platz 47 (von 52) Ã¢Â€Â“ 1 Spielzeit 2.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga. Am Ende der Saison 1973/74 war man jedoch wieder abgestiegen, und zwar in die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete 2. Bundesliga., 67947=Die Nachwuchsabteilung des Vereins galt jahrelang als grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Nachwuchsabteilung Deutschlands, der zeitweise 27 Mannschaften angehÃƒÂ¶rten. In der Saison 2006/07 spielten bei den B-MÃƒÂ¤dchen gleich drei Nationalspielerinnen: Isabelle Linden, Sara Doorsoun-Khajec (beide Deutschland U-17) und Arzu Karabulut (TÃƒÂ¼rkei)., 62851=Von 1967 bis 1978 fanden die Heimspiele des Vereins im MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion statt. Die Heimspiele der gemeinsamen Bundesliga-Saison 1973/74 mussten der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln und der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in der benachbarten MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Radrennbahn austragen.}","Saisondaten 1963Ã¢Â€Â“1969 Stand ewige Tabelle: 1. Liga: Platz 47 (von 52) Ã¢Â€Â“ 1 Spielzeit 2.

Platzierungen[Bearbeiten] Meister der Regionalliga West 2013/14 Mittelrheinpokal-Sieger 2012/13 Titel[Bearbeiten] Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga. Am Ende der Saison 1973/74 war man jedoch wieder abgestiegen, und zwar in die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete 2. Bundesliga., 67947=Die Nachwuchsabteilung des Vereins galt jahrelang als grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Nachwuchsabteilung Deutschlands, der zeitweise 27 Mannschaften angehÃƒÂ¶rten. In der Saison 2006/07 spielten bei den B-MÃƒÂ¤dchen gleich drei Nationalspielerinnen: Isabelle Linden, Sara Doorsoun-Khajec (beide Deutschland U-17) und Arzu Karabulut (TÃƒÂ¼rkei)., 62851=Von 1967 bis 1978 fanden die Heimspiele des Vereins im MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion statt. Die Heimspiele der gemeinsamen Bundesliga-Saison 1973/74 mussten der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln und der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in der benachbarten MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Radrennbahn austragen.}","Saisondaten 1963Ã¢Â€Â“1969 Stand ewige Tabelle: 1. Liga: Platz 47 (von 52) Ã¢Â€Â“ 1 Spielzeit 2.

Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf.

Der Spielbetrieb anderer Mannschaften wie der Jugendabteilung, der zweiten und dritten Mannschaft, der Damenmannschaft und der Handballabteilung war davon nicht betroffen. Der anfÃƒÂ¤ngliche Insolvenzplan fand keine Mehrheit in der GlÃƒÂ¤ubigerversammlung. Erst eine groÃƒÂŸe Spendenaktion und ein Benefizspiel gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln (10:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke vor 6350 Zuschauern) brachten die zunÃƒÂ¤chst ausreichende Summe von 35.000 Ã¢Â‚Â¬ zusammen. Der Spielbetrieb des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, seiner Jugendabteilung Ã¢Â€Â“ die mit 500 Spielern, 25 Mannschaften und 90 Trainern sowie Betreuern eine der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten JugendfuÃƒÂŸballabteilungen in ganz Deutschland darstellt Ã¢Â€Â“ unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung des damaligen Vorsitzenden Egbert Bischoff war vorerst gerettet., 65423=Die B-Juniorinnen gehÃƒÂ¶rten bis zur Saison 2010/11 der Regionalliga West an, zu deren GrÃƒÂ¼ndungsmitgliedern sie 2008/09 gehÃƒÂ¶rten. Davor gewannen sie mehrere Verbandsmeisterschaften und Pokalendspiele und waren die bis dahin erfolgreichste MÃƒÂ¤dchen-Abteilung im Verband Mittelrhein. Erst als sich Bayer 04 Leverkusen und der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in diesem Bereich engagierten, wurde die Erfolgskurve vor allem durch den Abgang zahlreicher Talente zu den groÃƒÂŸen Vereinen in der Nachbarschaft flacher., 16942=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln wurde am 21. Februar 1948 durch Fusion der Vereine Bayenthaler SV, Sparkassen-Verein 1927 KÃƒÂ¶ln und SV Victoria KÃƒÂ¶ln gegrÃƒÂ¼ndet. Alle drei Vereine waren vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg nicht allzu erfolgreich. Lediglich der SV Victoria 1911 kam 1943 ins Achtelfinale der Deutschen Meisterschaft. 1976 erfolgte noch die Eingliederung des FC Alter Markt KÃƒÂ¶ln., 37098=Seit der Saison 2014/2015 spielt Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach langer Zeit wieder im Profibereich Ã¢Â€Â“ in der 3. Liga. Der Klassenerhalt gelang am 36. Spieltag trotz einer deutlichen Niederlage bei Holstein Kiel., 31623=Ab der Saison 2005/06 spielte die erste Mannschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein und hatte mit im Schnitt 400 verkauften Karten mehr Zuschauer als so mancher Regionalligist. Mit einem siebten Platz zum Saisonende 2005/06 konnte der freie Fall der letzten Jahre gestoppt werden. Am 16. Oktober 2006 wÃƒÂ¤hlte die Mitgliederversammlung Klaus Ulonska zum neuen Vorsitzenden des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, nachdem Egbert Bischoff einige Wochen zuvor sein Amt niedergelegt hatte., 39680=Am 29. Mai 2013 besiegte die Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im Bonner Sportpark Nord im Finale um den Mittelrheinpokal Alemannia Aachen mit 2:1 und qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r den DFB-Pokal 2013/14. In der ersten Hauptrunde war der FSV Mainz 05 zu Gast im SÃƒÂ¼dstadion, die Mainzer gewannen 2:1.[6], 20076=In der 2. Bundesliga sollte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln in den folgenden Jahrzehnten fÃƒÂ¶rmlich kleben bleiben. Mehrmals wurde aus einer recht aussichtsreichen Position der Aufstieg vergeben. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hsommer 1986 hÃƒÂ¤tte der Verein beinahe den Wiederaufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga erreicht. In der Relegation setzte sich jedoch Borussia Dortmund im Entscheidungsspiel mit 8:0 durch. Das Spiel war notwendig geworden, nachdem die vorgesehenen zwei Spiele aus Sicht der Fortuna 2:0 in KÃƒÂ¶ln und 1:3 in Dortmund ausgegangen waren. Dort musste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln erst in der letzten Minute das 1:3 hinnehmen, das zum Torgleichstand fÃƒÂ¼hrte.[1] Die aus Europapokalspielen bekannte Regel, nach der diejenige Mannschaft siegt, die mehr Tore auf dem gegnerischen Platz erzielt hat (Ã¢Â€ÂžAuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregelÃ¢Â€Âœ), galt fÃƒÂ¼r Relegationsspiele damals noch nicht., 21248=Andererseits konnte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln aus teilweise hoffnungsloser Lage noch die Klasse halten. So war der Verein am Ende der Saison der deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1991/92 zwar sportlich abgestiegen, konnte aber nach dem Lizenzentzug von Blau-WeiÃƒÂŸ 90 Berlin doch noch in die Relegation einziehen und diese klar fÃƒÂ¼r sich entscheiden., 37710=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte 26 Jahre lang in der 2. Bundesliga. HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte der Vereinsgeschichte waren zum einen die Saison in der 1. Bundesliga (1973/74), als man nur wegen der schlechteren Tordifferenz wieder absteigen musste, und zum anderen das DFB-Pokalfinale 1983 am 11. Juni 1983 gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln, das die Fortuna mit 0:1 verlor. Wichtigste Spieler des Pokalfinalisten waren die StÃƒÂ¼rmer Dieter Schatzschneider und Dieter Lemke, TorhÃƒÂ¼ter Bernd Helmschrot, die Verteidiger Florian Hinterberger und JÃƒÂ¼rgen Beier sowie der Ã¢Â€ÂžMittelfeldmotorÃ¢Â€Âœ Hannes LinÃƒÂŸen. Im Halbfinale hatte man Borussia Dortmund mit 5:0 besiegt, im Viertelfinale und im Achtelfinale bereits gegen die beiden Erstligisten Borussia MÃƒÂ¶nchengladbach (Wiederholungsspiel nach einem 2:2 n. V.) und Eintracht Braunschweig jeweils mit 2:1 gewonnen., 21691=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln fand in all den Jahren als SÃƒÂ¼dstadtverein ÃƒÂ¼ber die Stadtgrenzen hinaus nur mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸige Resonanz bei wenigen, dafÃƒÂ¼r aber ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst treuen Zuschauern. Die in der Stadt dominierende Stellung des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln konnte niemals ernsthaft gefÃƒÂ¤hrdet werden. Einige der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸten Momente in der Vereinsgeschichte resultierten aber gerade aus den wenigen Lokalderbys mit dem groÃƒÂŸen Rivalen. In insgesamt nur zehn Pflichtspielen in ÃƒÂ¼ber fÃƒÂ¼nfzig Jahren gab es lediglich vier Begegnungen bei Pokalspielen und sechs in der 1. oder 2. Bundesliga. 1983 unterlag eine spielerisch und kÃƒÂ¤mpferisch bessere Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln im DFB-Pokalfinale in MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorf gegen einen schwachen 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln mit 0:1, das Publikum feierte jedoch die unglÃƒÂ¼cklichen Verlierer. In der Saison 1998/99 bot sich erneut die Chance einer ÃƒÂ„nderung der VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnisse, als der 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in die 2. Bundesliga abstieg. In beiden Lokalderbys dieser Saison wurden die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke im jeweils ausverkauften MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion mit 4:2 und 3:0 klar besiegt. In der Endabrechnung gelang der Wachwechsel jedoch nicht: Obwohl die Fortuna nach dem letzten Hinrundenspieltag noch drei PlÃƒÂ¤tze vor dem groÃƒÂŸen Stadtrivalen lag, beendete sie die Saison vier PlÃƒÂ¤tze hinter ihm; der Erfolg gegen den 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war dabei der einzige Sieg in der gesamten RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Dieser stieg in der Saison 1999/2000 wieder in die 1. Bundesliga auf, und die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter mussten trotz eines erneuten Siegs (4:1) gegen die GeiÃƒÂŸbÃƒÂ¶cke aus der 2. Bundesliga absteigen., 24061=Nach dem Abstieg zeigte sich mehr denn je, dass der Verein finanziell fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich von seinem Vorsitzenden und MÃƒÂ¤zen Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring abhing. Hinzu kam, dass die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter in der einzigen Erstligasaison 1973/74 finanzielles Pech hatten: Das MÃƒÂ¼ngersdorfer Stadion wurde neu gebaut und deshalb mussten die Heimspiele des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln und des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln in der viel kleineren Radrennbahn stattfinden, was sich auf der Einnahmenseite beider Vereine deutlich bemerkbar machte., 70272=Am 6. Dezember 2008 beschloss die Mitgliederversammlung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, bei wenigen Enthaltungen, schon vor Erreichen der 30.000 Mitglieder von deinfussballclub.de zum Jahresbeginn 2009 die erste FuÃƒÂŸball-Herrenmannschaft aus dem Hauptverein auszugliedern und in die Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH mit der DFC GmbH einzubringen. Die Ausgliederung wurde zum 1. Februar 2009 vollzogen. Bis Ende Oktober 2009 hatten sich etwas mehr als 10.500 Personen bei deinfussballclub.de registriert, im Mai 2011 waren nach Angaben der Betreiber noch rund 7.300 zahlende Mitglieder dabei. Demzufolge flossen ÃƒÂ¼ber die Spielbetriebsgesellschaft nach Abzug der Verwaltungskosten und der Mehrwertsteuer aus DFC-Mitteln mehr als 180.000 Euro pro Jahr in die erste Mannschaft des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln., 63659=Die FrauenfuÃƒÂŸballabteilung kann seit der GrÃƒÂ¼ndung 2003 einen steilen Aufstieg verzeichnen. Gleich in der ersten Saison wurde die im Schnitt 17 Jahre alte Mannschaft Kreismeister mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 192:7 Toren. Auf Anhieb schaffte sie dann den Durchmarsch in die Verbandsliga. Dort lieferte sich das Team einen Zweikampf mit dem Regionalligaabsteiger Rot-WeiÃƒÂŸ Merl. Mit einem Punkt RÃƒÂ¼ckstand reichte es nur zur Vizemeisterschaft. Ein Jahr spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit 16 Punkten Vorsprung unter Dach und Fach gebracht. Dort konnte sich das Team aber nicht lange halten und stieg 2009/10 wieder in die Verbandsliga ab. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der drohende Abstieg aus der Verbandsliga verhindert. 2011/12 gelang dann der Wiederaufstieg in die Regionalliga West, dem 2013 der erneute Abstieg in die Mittelrheinliga folgte. In der Saison 2013/2014 gelang dann dem fast unverÃƒÂ¤nderten Team ungeschlagen der direkte Wiederaufstieg., 27461=Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln stÃƒÂ¼rzte bis in die viertklassige Oberliga ab und musste dort im Laufe der Saison 2004/05 den Spielbetrieb aus finanziellen GrÃƒÂ¼nden einstellen, nachdem die Mannschaft in der gesamten Hinrunde nur drei Punkte auf ihr Konto gebracht hatte. Der vorerst letzte Auftritt in der Oberliga, ehe sich der Verein im Januar 2005 vom Spielbetrieb zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, war eine 0:5-Niederlage bei der U23-Mannschaft von Alemannia Aachen., 71109=Das Projekt deinfussballclub.de wurde im Januar 2012 eingestellt.[7] Die Anteile ÃƒÂ¼bernahm ein Investor, die DFC-Mitgliedschaften wurden bei unverÃƒÂ¤ndertem Beitragssatz in eine so genannte Ã¢Â€ÂžPremium-MitgliedschaftÃ¢Â€Âœ ÃƒÂ¼berfÃƒÂ¼hrt. ÃƒÂœber die Zahl der Mitglieder gibt der Betreiber keine Auskunft mehr., 25560=26 Jahre lang war es Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring gelungen, den kleinen Verein in der 2. Bundesliga zu halten. 2001 musste er jedoch Insolvenz anmelden. Er erkrankte bald darauf schwer an Krebs und starb im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2005. Ohne seinen MÃƒÂ¤zen ging es mit dem Verein steil bergab., 64781=Die Fortunen konnten bisher sechsmal den Kreispokal gewinnen Ã¢Â€Â“ zuletzt 2012. Den Mittelrheinpokal gewannen sie 2007, 2008 und 2013. 2008 gewannen die MÃƒÂ¤dchen und Frauen der SC Fortuna die Endspiele des FVM-Pokals der C-Juniorinnen, der B-Juniorinnen und der Frauen. In der Saison 2011/12 kamen die Fortuna-Frauen als Verbandsligistinnen nach einem Halbfinalsieg gegen den klassenhÃƒÂ¶heren VFL Kommern ins Endspiel um den Mittelrheinpokal. Dort unterlagen sie den Mitkonkurrentinnen um den Aufstieg von SF Uevekoven knapp mit 1:2. In der Saison 2012/2013 konnten sie dann gegen die gleichen Gegnerinnen den Pokal gewinnen., 40391=Am 1. Juni 2014 kehrte Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem dramatischen RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel bei Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen II in den ProfifuÃƒÂŸball (3. Liga) zurÃƒÂ¼ck. Nachdem man das Hinspiel im KÃƒÂ¶lner SÃƒÂ¼dstadion am 28. Mai mit 1:0 gewonnen hatte, lag man im RÃƒÂ¼ckspiel an der GrÃƒÂ¼nwalder StraÃƒÂŸe zur Pause mit 0:1 zurÃƒÂ¼ck und kassierte in der Schlussviertelstunde eine Gelb-Rote Karte. Kurz vor Ende der Spielzeit fiel das 2:0 fÃƒÂ¼r die Bayern. Die Fortuna erzielte jedoch in der allerletzten Minute der Nachspielzeit noch das 1:2 und stieg aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel auf., 35310=Aufsehen erregte der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln, als er die Hinrunde der Saison 2012/13 als Tabellenerster der Regionalliga West beendete und im Dezember 2012 dann die Verpflichtung des ehemaligen FuÃƒÂŸballprofis Matthias Scherz, der seine aktive Karriere beim 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln im Sommer 2009 eigentlich schon beendet hatte, bekanntgab. Die Chancen auf den Aufstieg in die 2008 geschaffene 3. Liga verspielten die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter jedoch in der RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde. Die Mannschaft beendete die Saison mit sieben Punkten RÃƒÂ¼ckstand auf Lotte auf dem zweiten Tabellenplatz. In der Saison 2013/14 qualifizierte man sich als Meister der Regionalliga West schlieÃƒÂŸlich fÃƒÂ¼r die Aufstiegsspiele zur 3. Liga. Dort setzte sich Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln nach einem 1:0-Heimsieg und einer 1:2-AuswÃƒÂ¤rtsniederlage aufgrund der AuswÃƒÂ¤rtstorregel gegen die zweite Mannschaft des FC Bayern MÃƒÂ¼nchen durch., 68495=Der mÃƒÂ¤nnliche Nachwuchs war jahrelang jeweils in der fÃƒÂ¼r ihn hÃƒÂ¶chstmÃƒÂ¶glichen Spielklasse vertreten. Als dann im JugendfuÃƒÂŸball die Regionalligen (jetzt: Junioren-Bundesliga) eingefÃƒÂ¼hrt wurden, spielten die Mannschaften immerhin noch in der zweithÃƒÂ¶chsten Klasse. Zum Bruch kam es erst in der Saison 2004/05, als die U19 aus der Verbandsliga (jetzt: Mittelrheinliga) abstieg; aktuell spielt sie in der Mittelrheinliga., 11374=Der Sportclub Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln e. V. ist ein FuÃƒÂŸball- und Handballverein. Der FuÃƒÂŸballverein ist nach dem 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln der erfolgreichste der Rheinmetropole. Nach einer einzigen Saison in der FuÃƒÂŸball-Bundesliga 1973/74 war die Fortuna 26 Jahre lang Zweitligist. Seit dem Aufstieg am Ende der Regionalligameisterschaft 2013/14 spielt der Verein in der 3. Liga., 25843=2003 stand der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln vor der drohenden Insolvenz. Fans starteten einen Spendenmarathon und baten als Ideengeber den KÃƒÂ¼nstler Cornel Wachter hinzu. Dessen erste Aktion zusammen mit dem Graphiker Marc TÃƒÂ¶lle war die Berufung von Schirmherren. Dies wurden der Philosoph und FuÃƒÂŸballfan Walter Jens sowie der Olympiasieger Dieter Baumann, der passend zur Situation des Vereins selbst wÃƒÂ¤hrend seiner sportlichen Karriere hingefallen und wieder aufgestanden war. Es folgte Wachters Pressefoto mit der nackten Oberligamannschaft samt Trainer Ralf Aussem und Co-Trainer Dieter Epstein, das um die Welt ging und die Spendenbereitschaft von halb KÃƒÂ¶ln wecken konnte., 32300=Am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2007/08 verpasste der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln gegen den VfL Leverkusen durch ein Unentschieden (1:1) knapp die Meisterschaft in der Verbandsliga Mittelrhein. Die SÃƒÂ¼dstÃƒÂ¤dter hÃƒÂ¤tten einen Sieg gegen Leverkusen, das vor diesem Ã¢Â€ÂžFinaleÃ¢Â€Âœ mit einem Punkt die Tabelle anfÃƒÂ¼hrte, benÃƒÂ¶tigt. Ausgetragen wurde dieses Spiel aufgrund des erwartet starken Andrangs nicht in Leverkusen, sondern Ã¢Â€Â“ auf Anraten der Polizei Ã¢Â€Â“ im neutralen Sportpark HÃƒÂ¶henberg, der SpielstÃƒÂ¤tte des FC Viktoria KÃƒÂ¶ln, sodass sich eine fÃƒÂ¼r diese Spielklasse bemerkenswerte Kulisse von 7000 Zuschauern einfand. Doch dann wurde dem VfL Leverkusen wegen verspÃƒÂ¤tet eingereichter Unterlagen zum Lizenzierungsverfahren durch das Sportgericht des Westdeutschen FuÃƒÂŸball- und Leichtathletikverbandes am 10. Juli 2008 der Aufstieg verweigert. Der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln spielte daher ab der Saison 2008/09 in der neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten fÃƒÂ¼nftklassigen NRW-Liga. FÃƒÂ¼r den Verein war es der erste Aufstieg seit 35 Jahren., 33547=Im Mai 2009 wurde bekannt, dass sich der SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln verschuldet hatte, um die Kosten der Hinrunde 2008/09 zu decken.[2] Die erste Saison in der neuen NRW-Liga beendete die Mannschaft nach einer durchwachsenen RÃƒÂ¼ckrunde mit einem TorverhÃƒÂ¤ltnis von 60:55 auf dem neunten Tabellenplatz. Kevin Kruth wurde mit 21 Treffern Zweiter in der TorschÃƒÂ¼tzenliste.[3] Die Saison 2009/10, fÃƒÂ¼r die als Ziel Platz sechs ausgegeben worden war, schloss die Mannschaft auf einem enttÃƒÂ¤uschenden 15. Tabellenplatz ab, nur die Tordifferenz trennte sie von einem Abstiegsrang. In der Saison 2010/11 wurde der Aufstieg in die Regionalliga West mit dem dritten Tabellenplatz sportlich zwar knapp verfehlt, durch den RÃƒÂ¼ckzug des eigentlichen Aufsteigers Germania Windeck am 6. Juni 2011 aber dann doch glÃƒÂ¼cklich erreicht.[4] Am 15. Juni 2011 erteilte der Deutsche FuÃƒÂŸballbund der Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln Spielbetriebsgesellschaft mbH endgÃƒÂ¼ltig die Lizenz fÃƒÂ¼r die Regionalliga-Saison 2011/12.[5] Die erste Spielzeit beendete die Mannschaft ÃƒÂ¼berraschend auf dem siebten Tabellenplatz Ã¢Â€Â“ mit einem Kader, der wegen der lange herrschenden Unklarheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Aufstieg grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸtenteils fÃƒÂ¼r die NRW-Liga konzipiert war., 69382=Ab dem 3. April 2008 rÃƒÂ¤umte der Verein nach dem Vorbild von Ebbsfleet United bei seiner ersten FuÃƒÂŸballherrenmannschaft externen Personen ein eingeschrÃƒÂ¤nktes Mitspracherecht ein. Die neu gegrÃƒÂ¼ndete deinfussballclub.de DFC GmbH versuchte anfangs unter der Schirmherrschaft von Filmregisseur SÃƒÂ¶nke Wortmann innerhalb eines Jahres 30.000 Mitglieder zu akquirieren. FÃƒÂ¼r einen Jahresbeitrag von 39,95 Euro hatten diese Mitglieder ein Mitspracherecht bei Transfers, AbschlÃƒÂ¼ssen von Freundschaftsspielen, Trikotfarben, dem Merchandising und anderen vereinsinternen Belangen. Auch bei der Mannschaftsaufstellung sollte die Meinung der Mitglieder gehÃƒÂ¶rt werden, allerdings behielt der Trainer das letzte Wort., 17656=Die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des SC Fortuna KÃƒÂ¶ln acht Tage nach der des 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln war ein weiterer Versuch, aus mehreren Stadtteilmannschaften eine erfolgreiche Gesamt-KÃƒÂ¶lner Mannschaft zu bilden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren gelang es dem Verein im Gegensatz zum 1. FC KÃƒÂ¶ln jedoch nicht, erstklassig zu spielen. Dies ÃƒÂ¤nderte sich ab 1967 durch das vor allem auch finanzielle Engagement des damaligen PrÃƒÂ¤sidenten Jean LÃƒÂ¶ring. 1973 gelang schlieÃƒÂŸlich der Aufstieg in die 1. Bundesliga.

Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  by BeckyMac If you're looking for music that makes you believe you can get through anything, this is a terrific, inspiring album. The themes are about love, friendship and the power of faith and community. The music gets stuck in your head. ""Beyond"" is probably my favorite song and speaks to you about finding your own beliefs in this world and not just following blindly. Three Twelve has three amazing singers in David M. Glasgow, Deb McClain, and Jason Whetstone. David's melodies are beautiful, catchy and sometimes haunting..and when you add in the harmonies? Forget about it! Buy this album!

Consider these ways to cover your overdrafts: Set up an overdraft line of credit with the bank. You need to apply for a Ã¢Â€Âœline of creditÃ¢Â€? just as you would apply for a regular loan. If you overdraw your account, we will lend you the funds by using your line of credit and you will pay interest on the money borrowed just like a regular loan. Link your checking account to another account you have with the bank. If you overdraw your checking account, the bank can transfer funds from your other account to your checking account. Ask about transfer fees. The best way to avoid overdrafts and fees is to keep track of your account balance by entering all checks, debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals in your check register, reconcile your check book regularly and manage your finances responsibly. However, if a mistake occurs, Peoples Bank offers additional ways to cover overdrafts in addition to No Bounce Advantage. What are some other ways to cover overdrafts? There is no additional cost associated with this protection unless you use it. You will be charged a fee of $36.00 for each overdrawn item created by a traditional paper-based check, a teller withdrawal, an automatic payment (ACH) transaction or a recurring debit card payment. Also, if you have requested us to do so, we may authorize and cover ATM transfers or withdrawals and everyday debit card purchases.

Avoid using it as a short-term loanÃ¢Â€Â”it is a costly form of credit. If you overdraw your account, get money back into your account as soon as possible. Remember that you need to put enough money back into your account to cover both the amount of your overdraft and any bank fees. Even if you have one of these plans, there is no guarantee that your bank will cover your checks, ATM withdrawals and debit card and other electronic transactions that overdraw your account. Good account management is the lowest-cost way to protect your hard-earned money. If you need overdraft protection every now and then, ask us about the choices and services that are right for you.

Even if you have No Bounce Advantage overdraft coverage, you may not be covered for ATM and one-time debit transaction overdrafts.

H. A. Newman ""e aprendeu com elas do trabalho de GÃƒÂ¶del e o Entscheidungsproblem ... Newman usou a palavra ""mecÃƒÂ¢nico"" ... Em seu obituÃƒÂ¡rio de Turing em 1955 Newman escreveu:, 35432=Com relaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o aos problemas de Hilbert propostos pelo famoso matemÃƒÂ¡tico David Hilbert em 1900, um aspecto do problema #10 tinha ficado flutuando por quase 30 anos antes de ser enquadrado com precisÃƒÂ£o. A expressÃƒÂ£o original de Hilbert para o 10Ã‚Âº problema ÃƒÂ© a seguinte:, 39955=O problema era que uma resposta primeiro exigia uma definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o precisa de ""prescriÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o definitiva geral aplicÃƒÂ¡vel"", que o professor de Princeton Alonzo Church viria a chamar de "" mÃƒÂ©todo efetivo "", e em 1928 nÃƒÂ£o existia tal definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o. Mas ao longo dos prÃƒÂ³ximos 6-7 anos Emil Post desenvolveu sua definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de um trabalhador passando de um cÃƒÂ´modo para um outro cÃƒÂ´modo escrevendo e apagando marcas em uma lista de instruÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes (Post 1936), assim como Church e os seus dois alunos Stephen Kleene e J. B. Rosser pelo uso do lambda-cÃƒÂ¡lculo de Church e a teoria da recursÃƒÂ£o de GÃƒÂ¶del (1934). O artigo de Church (publicado 15 de abril de 1936) mostrou que o Entscheidungsproblem era de fato ""indecidÃƒÂ­vel"" e superou Turing por quase um ano (o artigo de Turing foi submetido em 28 de maio de 1936 e publicado em janeiro de 1937). Nesse meio tempo, Emil Post apresentou um breve artigo no outono de 1936, Turing, pelo menos, tinha prioridade sobre Post. Enquanto Church arbitrou o artigo de Turing, Turing teve tempo para estudar o artigo de Church e adicionar um ApÃƒÂªndice onde ele provava que o lambda-cÃƒÂ¡lculo de Church e suas mÃƒÂ¡quinas calculariam as mesmas funÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes., 30999=Robin Gandy (1919-1995), um estudante de Alan Turing (1912-1954) e seu amigo ao longo da vida, traÃƒÂ§a a linhagem da noÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de ""mÃƒÂ¡quina de calcular"" atÃƒÂ© a Babbage (em cerca de 1834) e, na verdade, propÃƒÂµe a ""Tese de Babbage"":, 39065=AtÃƒÂ© o Congresso Internacional de MatemÃƒÂ¡ticos em 1928, Hilbert ""fez suas perguntas bastante precisas.

A expressÃƒÂ£o original de Hilbert para o 10Ã‚Âº problema ÃƒÂ© a seguinte:, 39955=O problema era que uma resposta primeiro exigia uma definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o precisa de ""prescriÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o definitiva geral aplicÃƒÂ¡vel"", que o professor de Princeton Alonzo Church viria a chamar de "" mÃƒÂ©todo efetivo "", e em 1928 nÃƒÂ£o existia tal definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o. Mas ao longo dos prÃƒÂ³ximos 6-7 anos Emil Post desenvolveu sua definiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de um trabalhador passando de um cÃƒÂ´modo para um outro cÃƒÂ´modo escrevendo e apagando marcas em uma lista de instruÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes (Post 1936), assim como Church e os seus dois alunos Stephen Kleene e J. B. Rosser pelo uso do lambda-cÃƒÂ¡lculo de Church e a teoria da recursÃƒÂ£o de GÃƒÂ¶del (1934). O artigo de Church (publicado 15 de abril de 1936) mostrou que o Entscheidungsproblem era de fato ""indecidÃƒÂ­vel"" e superou Turing por quase um ano (o artigo de Turing foi submetido em 28 de maio de 1936 e publicado em janeiro de 1937). Nesse meio tempo, Emil Post apresentou um breve artigo no outono de 1936, Turing, pelo menos, tinha prioridade sobre Post. Enquanto Church arbitrou o artigo de Turing, Turing teve tempo para estudar o artigo de Church e adicionar um ApÃƒÂªndice onde ele provava que o lambda-cÃƒÂ¡lculo de Church e suas mÃƒÂ¡quinas calculariam as mesmas funÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes., 30999=Robin Gandy (1919-1995), um estudante de Alan Turing (1912-1954) e seu amigo ao longo da vida, traÃƒÂ§a a linhagem da noÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o de ""mÃƒÂ¡quina de calcular"" atÃƒÂ© a Babbage (em cerca de 1834) e, na verdade, propÃƒÂµe a ""Tese de Babbage"":, 39065=AtÃƒÂ© o Congresso Internacional de MatemÃƒÂ¡ticos em 1928, Hilbert ""fez suas perguntas bastante precisas.

If it isn't marked ""testcase"" in the title, make a note of that. Check that the testcase works! (And doesn't work!) Most importantly, we need to create testcases. These are time-consuming, but extremely useful and really help out developers. [edit] Unclear If something has no clear instructions on how to reproduce it, or has little useful information, add a comment asking the reporter for more detail. Then list it in the bugs awaiting feedback section. Be polite, we want to be nice to our bug reporters! [edit] Is it a big bug? Prioritizing is good. If a major website doesn't work, that is important. Let's keep track of them. [edit] Version field Keep an eye on what the ""Version:"" fields say in Bugzilla. If it says ""unspecified"", it won't show up in developer's searches for 4.0 bugs!

Dorm Life the dorms at shorter are a little in poor condition. the dorms are livable but just a little smelly. my resident hall might not be as good as i see in movies but the people i live with make up for it. Academic Rigor shorter univesity has an rigorous lesson plan. the professors keep us students busy with school work. the work load is some what a lot but it is manageable. Tips for prospective students a major tip needed for college is time management. what you do on your free time is very important. In three sentences shorter university is a very small campus, which i really like. i also feel that there are a lot of kind and nice people here at shorter univesity. if i were to rate my school it would defiantly be 8 out of 10.

While there's no exact limit to the number of links you should include on a page, best practice is to avoid exceeding 200 links. Links pass value from one page to another, but the amount of value that can be passed is split between all of the links on a page. This means that adding unnecessary links will dilute the potential value attributed to your other links. Using the Nofollow attribute prevents value from being passed to the linking page, but it's worth noting that these links are still added to the equasion when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so Nofollow links can also dilute pagerank. 2.2522522522523 Broken Links High impact",True,0,0,,
