Why don't you have a go at poling your own mokoro? It is not as easy as it looks! Day 42, Okavango Delta to Maun Today we return to Maun, however, you will have the chance for an early morning game walk before packing up camp. There is also the option of a scenic flight over the Delta in the afternoon - the best way to appreciate the expanse of waterways you have travelled through. Day 43, Maun to Rundu We head in a north west direction along the Kavango River and enter Namibia. We stock up on supplies in Rundu before reaching our campsite for the night on the banks of the Kavango River. Our campsite is complete with 'open air' facilities and the occasional wild hippo grazing on the lawn. Day 44, Rundu to Etosha National Park We arrive at Etosha National Park in the late afternoon. Etosha is Namibia's major nature reserve, covering over 22 000 square kilometres with a large variety of animal and bird species. The park is situated around the Etosha Pan, and has a network of gravel roads that enables us to get to far & remote areas of the park.",False,-1,0,"{75915=20 Sep 2015, 69192=09 Aug 2015, 64772=05 Sep 2015, 69254=03 Oct 2015, 67013=19 Sep 2015, 78218=28 Nov 2015, 66951=26 Jul 2015, 71433=23 Aug 2015, 75977=14 Nov 2015, 78156=04 Oct 2015, 64814=ZAR 32290 + USD 1470, 80459=12 Dec 2015, 80397=18 Oct 2015, 45030=Today we head for Swakopmund, an old German colony founded in 1892.

Elleval was in excellent form at Dundalk before gaining a surprise victory in a conditions event over 7f here three weeks ago when Luhaif was 3l away in third and Tarbawi a further 2l behind. There's no difference at the weights here so David Marnane's charge should have the call again. DEAUVILLE PRINCE won a Listed contest at Ripon in August and wasn't beaten far in a Group 1 in Italy subsequently.

MUSIC CHART, who finished third, had no opportunity to play to her strengths and wasn't given the best of rides so she's taken to reverse the form with the winner and runner-up Shuruq and take this. Emotif, the only southern hemisphere entry, started a short-priced favourite and was another hopelessly placed when the sprint for the line began so she's expected to do much better with a stiffer test of stamina., 11137=Global City won twice here in February 2010 but hasn't won since though he's dropped in the weights accordingly. Hitchens, who was in brilliant form here last year, has yet to find his feet this season but is well drawn and has to go on the shortlist. However, along with Govinda and Es Que Love he was behind DUBAWI SOUND in the Group 3 Al Shindagha Sprint a fortnight ago and with no particular reason for a reversal of the form it's David Brown's charge who can land the spoils. The Reaper was in fine form at this time a year ago and he'll be better for his recent run after a very long break so should be kept on the right side despite a big weight. Whaileyy had been in fine form on Polytrack before heading here but unshipped Martin Harley at the start on his intended debut last month. Faridat invariably competes at the highest level over longer trips on Dirt in Japan. He's up to winning this if he takes to the surface but may do better when tackling further. Justineo showed good pace over 7f last time on Turf and if taking to Tapeta looks well enough handicapped to get involved.}"

As one of the company's best-selling acoustics, the J-45 Standard is highly regarded for its full and balanced expression, warm bass, and excellent projection. With Rotomatic tuners, beautiful tonewoods, and an L.R. Baggs Element pickup, Gibson's J-45 Standard begs to be played. Hear the J-45 for yourself with this zZounds exclusive video: Tonewoods of the Highest Caliber for This WorkhorseTop-quality tonewoods and craftsmanship give the J-45 Standard its expressive sound, projection, and superior feel. The guitar's top is constructed of AA-grade Sitka spruce, while the back and sides are made from pattern-grade Honduras mahogany. Simple yet sweet, the rosette on the J-45 Standard is a single ring consisting of three-ply binding.

Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo controlled trial. After assignment of the written informed consent, thirty six patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be enrolled, and will be randomized by block randomization into treatment or placebo arm. All the enrolled patients will be in the waiting list of liver transplantation. In the treatment arm bone marrow of the patients will be aspirated, and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured, and then will be infused through a peripheral vein. Also, the corresponding placebo will be infused for the placebo group. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after performing the procedure. Ã‚Â  Eligibility",True,0,0,,,

The International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems ICD-10 defines hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) as persistent and excessive vomiting starting before the end of the 22nd week of gestation, and further subdivides the condition into mild and severe, severe being associated with metabolic disturbances such as carbohydrate depletion, dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. HG is a diagnosis of exclusion, characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, large ketonuria and > 5% bodyweight loss. HG affects approximately 0.3- 2.0% of pregnancies and is the commonest indication for admission to hospital in the first half of pregnancy and second only to preterm labor as a cause of hospitalisation overall. According to the Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation, conservative estimates indicate that HG can cost a minimum of $200 million annually in house hospitalizations in the United states. Taking into account other factors such as emergency room treatments, potential complications of severe HG and the fact that up to 35% of women with paid employment will lose time from work through nausea the actual cost of NVP to the economy is significantly higher. NVP can be extremely debilitating for the patient and if inadequately managed can cause significant morbidities including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, thrombosis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, depressive illness and poor pregnancy",False,-1,0,,,

Seizures, cognitive deterioration, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are frequent features of this disease which typically shortens life expectancy. Idebenone, an ATP production modulator and antioxidant, improves neurological function in Friedreich's ataxia, a disease also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Given that there is no effective treatment for MELAS, the investigators propose a Phase II proof of concept trial of idebenone to study its preliminary efficacy in patients with MELAS and the A3243G mtDNA mutation, and to study its safety and tolerability in this patient group. The investigators propose to evaluate 21 patients with the A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation and MELAS (defined by a history of either seizures or stroke). Patients will receive idebenone (900 mg/day or 2250 mg/day) or matching placebo for one month. The primary outcome measure is cerebral lactate levels measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), a biomarker associated with disease worsening.

As the most extensive and close interaction the Ancient Greeks ever had with any outsider was that with the Persians, the term became coined forever, even long after the Persian rule in Ancient Greece and beyond had ended and other dynasties were now ruling the regions.

Ismail instigated a forced conversion from Sunni to Shi'a Islam,[101] by which Shiism spread throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus, Iran, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. It also was directly responsible for the fact that modern-day Iran and the neighbouring Republic of Azerbaijan are the only official Shia nations in the world, with it holding an absolute majority in both nations, as well as having the 1st and 2nd highest number of Shia adherents by population percentage in the world.[102] The people of nowadays Iran and Azerbaijan were put into conversion at the same time in history.[103] The centuries long geo-political and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire led to numerous OttomanÃ¢Â€Â“Persian Wars.[98] The Safavid era peaked in the reign of the brilliant soldier, statesman and administrator Shah Abbas I (1587Ã¢Â€Â“1629),[26][98] surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid era also saw the start of the creation of a new layer in Iranian society, composed of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians, Circassians, Armenians, and other peoples of the Caucasus, who would continue to play a crucial role in Iranian history. Following a slow decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s by internal strife, royal intrigues, continuous wars between them and their Ottoman arch rivals, and foreign interference (most notably by the Russians) the Safavid dynasty was ended by Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722., 230029=Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8% per year.

Through the Constitutional Revolution, the first Iranian Constitution was founded as well in 1906. The Constitution included the official recognition of Iran's three religious minorities, namely the Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews,[121] which has remained a fundament in Iran's legislation ever since. The struggle related to the Constitutional movement continued until 1911, when Mohammad Ali was defeated and forced to abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911. During World War I, the British occupied much of western Iran, not fully withdrawing until 1921. The Persian Campaign commenced furthermore during World War I in northwestern Iran after an Ottoman invasion, as part of the Middle Eastern Theatre of World War I. As a result of Ottoman hostilities across the border, a large amount of Iran's Assyrians were massacred in those regions, notably in and around Urmia by the Ottoman armies.[27][122] Apart from Agha Mohammad Khan's rule, Qajar rule is characterised as a century of misrule.[95], 184842=The political system of the Islamic Republic is based on the 1979 Constitution, and comprises several intricately connected governing bodies.

In 1795, following the disobedience of their Georgian subjects and their alliance with the Russians, the Qajars captured, sacked and ravaged Tblisi, and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing full Iranian suzerainty over the region. However reestablishment of Iranian control would prove to be short-lived, and the Russo-Persian War (1804Ã¢Â€Â“13) and the Russo-Persian War (1826Ã¢Â€Â“28) resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had made part of the concept of Iran for three centuries,[28] and thus substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire. As a result of these Russo-Persian wars of the 19th century, the Russians took over the Caucasus from Iran, and by that, Iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region, comprising modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, which got confirmed per the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay of 1813 and 1828 respectively.[29][107] The area to the North of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and all of Armenia were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.[29][108][109][110][111][112][113], 107100=In 1921, Reza Khan, Prime Minister of Iran and former general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, overthrew the Qajar Dynasty and became Shah. In 1941 he was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after Iran came under British and Russian occupation following the Anglo-Soviet invasion and established the Persian Corridor, a massive supply route that would last until the end of the war. The presence of so many foreign troops in the nation also culminated in the Soviet-backed establishment of two puppet regimes in the nation; the Azerbaijan People's Government, and the Republic of Mahabad. As the Soviet Union refused to relinquish occupied Iranian territory, it resulted in the Iran crisis of 1946 which on its part resulted in the dissolution of both puppet states, and the withdrawal of the Soviets., 219577=Economic sanctions against Iran, such as the embargo against Iranian crude oil, have affected the economy.[207] Sanctions have led to a steep fall in the value of the rial, and as of April 2013 one US dollar is worth 36,000 rial, compared with 16,000 in early 2012.[208] Following a successful implementation of the 2015 nuclear and sanctions relief deal, the resulting benefits might not be distributed evenly across the Iranian economy as political elites such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have garnered more resources and economic interests.[209][210], 270009=Judaism also has a long history in Iran, dating back to the Achaemenid Conquest of Babylonia. Although many left in the wake of the establishment of the State of Israel and the 1979 Revolution, around 8,756 Jews remain in Iran, according to the latest census.[276], 317527=Today the musical culture of Persia, while distinct, is closely related to other musical systems of West and Central Asia, and the Caucasus. It has also even affinities to the music cultures deeper into Asia and to a certain degree even to those of Africa, and in the period after 1850 particularly, to that of Europe. Its history can be traced to some extent through these relationships.[citation needed], 110675=After the coup, the Shah became increasingly autocratic and Sultanistic, and Iran entered a phase of decades long very close relations with the United States, and the rest of the West.[124] While the Shah increasingly Westernized and modernized Iran and retained it a fully secular state,[30] arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political opposition. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini became an active critic of the Shah's White Revolution and publicly denounced the government. Khomeini was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government. The Shah sent him into exile. He went first to Turkey, then to Iraq and finally to France., 94108=In 1738-39, he invaded India and sacked far off Delhi, bringing great loot back to Persia. His territorial expansion as well as his military successes went into a decline following the final campaigns in the North Caucasus. Nader Shah's assassination sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which Karim Khan Zand came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.[98] However, the geo-political reach of the Zand dynasty was limited compared to its predecessing dynasties, and thus many of Irans territories in the Caucasus gained de facto independance, and were locally ruled through various Caucasian khanates. However, though often self ruling, they all remained subjects and vassals to the Iranian king,[105] The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.[106], 150749=One of the most famous members of Iranian wildlife is the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah, also known as the Iranian Cheetah, whose numbers were greatly reduced after the 1979 Revolution., 208139=Since the 1979 Revolution, to overcome foreign embargo, Iran has developed its own military industry, produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, submarines, military vessels, guided missile destroyer, radar systems, helicopters and fighter planes.[189][190][191] In recent years, official announcements have highlighted the development of weapons such as the Hoot, Kowsar, Zelzal, Fateh-110, Shahab-3 and Sejjil missiles, and a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).[192] The Fajr-3 (MIRV) is currently Iran's most advanced ballistic missile, it is a liquid fuel missile with an undisclosed range which was developed and produced domestically., 223033=The most popular tourist destinations are Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz.[214] In the early 2000s the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training.[215] The majority of the 300,000 tourist visas granted in 2003 were obtained by Asian Muslims, who presumably intended to visit important pilgrimage sites in Mashhad and Qom.[213] Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003 Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide.[216] According to UNESCO and the deputy head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is rated among the ""10 most touristic countries in the world"".[216] Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world.[212][217][218] Weak advertising, unstable regional conditions, a poor public image in some parts of the world, and absence of efficient planning schemes in the tourism sector have all hindered the growth of tourism., 29727=Rashidun Muslims invaded Persia in 633Ã‚Â AD, and conquered it by 651Ã‚Â AD, largely replacing Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism.[24] Iran thereafter played a vital role in the subsequent Islamic Golden Age, producing many influential scientists, scholars, artists, and thinkers. The emergence in 1501 of the Safavid dynasty, which promoted Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion, marked one of the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history.[5][25][26] Starting in 1736 under Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest territorial extent since the Sassanid Empire, briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world.[27] In the course of the 19th century, Iran irrevocably lost swaths of its territories in the Caucasus region which made part of the concept of Iran for three centuries,[28] to neighboring Imperial Russia.[29] The Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906 established the nation's first parliament, which operated within a constitutional monarchy. Following a coup d'ÃƒÂ©tat instigated by the U.K. and the U.S. in 1953, Iran gradually became very close allies with the US and the rest of the West, remained secular, but grew increasingly autocratic.[30] Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the 1979 Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1Ã‚Â April 1979.[18][31], 212025=Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.[193] In 2011 GDP was $482.4 billion ($1.003 trillion at PPP), or $13,200 at PPP per capita.[35] Iran is ranked as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank.[194] In the early 21st century the service sector contributed the largest percentage of the GDP, followed by industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture.[195] The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for developing and maintaining the Iranian rial, which serves as the country's currency. The government doesn't recognize trade unions other than the Islamic Labour Councils, which are subject to the approval of employers and the security services.[196] The minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134).[197] Unemployment has remained above 10% since 1997, and the unemployment rate for women is almost double that of the men.[197], 323411=The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25 commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early 60s, increasing to 65 by the end of the decade. The majority of production focused on melodrama and thrillers. With the screening of the films Kaiser and The Cow, directed by Masoud Kimiai and Dariush Mehrjui respectively in 1969, alternative films established their status in the film industry. Attempts to organize a film festival that had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival, bore fruits in the form of the Sepas Festival in 1969. The endeavors also resulted in the formation of the Tehran World Festival in 1973., 112166=Due to the 1973 spike in oil prices IranÃ¢Â€Â™s economy was flooded with foreign currency which caused inflation. By 1974 IranÃ¢Â€Â™s economy was experiencing double digit inflation and despite many large projects to modernize the country corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976 an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of young men who had migrated to IranÃ¢Â€Â™s cities looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By 1977 many of these men opposed the shahÃ¢Â€Â™s regime and began to organize and join protests against it.[125], 242651=Iran placed its domestically built satellite, Omid into orbit on the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Revolution, on 2 February 2009,[241] through Safir rocket, becoming the ninth country in the world capable of both producing a satellite and sending it into space from a domestically made launcher.[242], 118727=On 4 November 1979, a group of Iranian students seized the U.S. embassay and took 52 US citizens and embassy personnel hostage[134] after the US refused to return the former Shah to Iran to face trial and execution. Attempts by the Jimmy Carter administration to negotiate for the release of the hostages and a failed rescue attempt helped force Carter out of office and brought Ronald Reagan to power. On Jimmy Carter's final day in office the last hostages were finally set free as a result of the Algiers Accords., 164644=Iran has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world. From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased from 27% to 60%.[153] The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban.[154][not in citation given] Most internal migrants have settled near the cities of Tehran, Isfahan, Ahvaz, and Qom. The listed populations are from the 2006/07 (1385Ã‚Â AP) census.[155][not in citation given] Tehran, with a population of 7,705,036, is the largest city in Iran and is the capital. Tehran, like many big cities, suffers from severe air pollution. It is the hub of the country's communication and transport network., 301529=Persian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures. It dates back to the poetry of Avesta, about 1000 years BC. These poems which were a part of the oral traditions of ancient Iran, were orally transferred, and later created parts of the AvestaÃ¢Â€Â™s book during the Sassanid era. Its sources have been within historical Persia where the Persian language has historically been the national language., 323061=The first silent Iranian film was made by Professor Ovanes Ohanian in 1930, and the first sounded one, Lor Girl, was made by Abd ol Hossein Sepanta in 1932., 237388=Iran has increased its publication output nearly tenfold from 1996 through 2004, and has been ranked first in terms of output growth rate, followed by China.[231] According to SCImago, Iran could rank fourth in the world in terms of research output by 2018, if the current trend persists.[232], 195069=The state-owned Telecommunication Company of Iran handles telecommunications. The media of Iran is a mixture of private and state-owned, but books and movies must be approved by the The ministry of Ershaad before being released to the public. Iran originally received access to the internet in 1993, and it has become enormously popular among the Iranian youth., 305481=Iranian philosophy can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts which originated in ancient Indo-Iranian roots and were considerably influenced by Zarathustra's teachings. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, ""Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on Middle Platonism."", 49899=The earliest archaeological artifacts in Iran, like those excavated at the Kashafrud and Ganj Par sites, attest to a human presence in Iran since the Lower Paleolithic era.[52] Neanderthal artifacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period have been found mainly in the Zagros region at sites such as Warwasi and Yafteh Cave.[53][54][pageÃ‚Â needed] Early agricultural communities such as Chogha Golan in 10,000 BC[55][56] began to flourish in Iran along with settlements such as Chogha Bonut in 8000 BC,[57][58] as well as Susa and Chogha Mish developing in and around the Zagros region.[59][pageÃ‚Â needed][60][61], 254725=Turkic languages and dialects, most importantly the Azerbaijani language which is by far the most spoken language in the country after the official language of Persian,[259] are spoken in different areas in Iran, but is especially widely and dominantly spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan. Arabic is also spoken by the Arabs of Khuzestan, and the wider group of Iranian Arabs., 61957=In 550Ã‚Â BC, Cyrus the Great from the state of Anshan took over the Median empire, and founded the Achaemenid empire by unifying other city states. The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the Persian revolt; the brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler Astyages and quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia, Babylon, Egypt, and the lands to the west of the Indus and Oxus rivers. At its greatest extent, the empire included the modern territories of Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya, Thrace, Paeonia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, much of the Black Sea coastal regions, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, much of Central Asia, Afghanistan, northern Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and parts of Oman and the UAE, making it the first world empire and the largest one had yet seen.[21] In 480 BCE, it is estimated that 50 million[74] people lived in the Achaemenid Empire.[75] According to Guinness World Records, the empire at its peak ruled over 44% of the world's population, the highest such figure for any empire in history.[76] It is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the Greek city states[21] during the Greco-Persian Wars, for emancipation of slaves including the Jewish exiles in Babylon, and for building infrastructure such as a postal system and road systems, and the use of an official language, Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under a king and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar systems in later empires.[77] The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was built in the empire as well., 229096=In 2004, a large share of natural gas reserves in Iran were untapped. The addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first solar thermal plant is to come online in 2009. Iran is the third country in the world to have developed GTL technology.[224], 168410=The fourth major city of Iran is Tabriz (population 1,378,935), the capital of the East Azerbaijan Province. It is also the second industrial city of Iran after Tehran. Tabriz had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the Qajar dynasty. The city has proven extremely influential in the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s recent history., 118041=On March 8, 1979, coinciding with International Women's Day, many Iranian women demonstrated against perceived reductions to the status and rights of women, especially with regard to family law and mandatory veiling.[133] The Iranian Cultural Revolution began in 1980 and universities were closed by the theocratic regime., 109761=In 1951 Mohammad Mosaddegh was elected prime minister. He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran's petroleum industry and oil reserves. He was deposed in the 1953 Iranian coup d'ÃƒÂ©tat, an Anglo-American covert operation that marked the first time the US had overthrown a foreign government during the Cold War.[123], 253188=In southwestern and southern Iran, the Luri and Lari languages are spoken. In northern Iran, mostly confined to Gilan and Mazandaran, the Gilaki and Mazandarani languages are widely spoken, which, depending on author, are classified as either a dialect of Persian or a different Iranian language. They both have affinities to neighbouring Caucasian languages. In Kurdistan Province and nearby areas, Kurdish is widely spoken. In Khuzestan, many distinct Persian dialects are spoken. Furthmore, in parts of Gilan, Talysh is widely spoken, which stretches up to neighbouring Azerbaijan., 123433=The 2005 presidential election brought the conservative populist candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to power.[138] During the 2009 Iranian presidential election the Interior Ministry announced incumbent president Ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote, while Mir-Hossein Mousavi had come in second place with 33.75%.[139][140] Allegations of large irregularities and fraud provoked the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests both within Iran and in major cites outside the country.[141], 249365=Iran's population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century, increasing from about 19 million in 1956 to around 75 million by 2009.[250][251] However, Iran's birth rate has dropped significantly in recent years, leading to a population growth rateÃ¢Â€Â”recorded from July 2012Ã¢Â€Â”of about 1.29 percent.[252] Studies project that Iran's rate of growth will continue to slow until it stabilizes above 105 million by 2050.[253][254], 309966=Myths play a crucial part in Iranian culture and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the context of Iranian history.[citation needed] For this purpose we must ignore modern political boundaries and look at historical developments in the Greater Iran, a vast area covering the Caucasus, Anatolia, and Central Asia, beyond the frontiers of present-day Iran. The geography of this region, with its high mountain ranges, plays a significant role in many of the mythological stories. The 2nd millennium BC is usually regarded as the age of migration because of the emergence in western Iran of a new form of Iranian pottery, similar to earlier wares of north-eastern Iran, suggesting the arrival of the Ancient Iranian peoples. This pottery, light grey to black in colour, appeared around 1400 BC. It is called Early Grey Ware or Iron I, the latter name indicating the beginning of the Iron Age in this area.[304], 122634=Following the IranÃ¢Â€Â“Iraq War, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his administration (1989-1997) concentrated on a pragmatic pro-business policy of rebuilding and strengthening the economy without making any dramatic break with the ideology of the revolution. Rafsanjani was succeeded by the moderate reformist Mohammad Khatami whose government (1997-2005) attempted, unsuccessfully, to make the country more free and democratic.[137], 200107=Since 2005, Iran's nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the international community following earlier quotes of Iranian leadership favoring the use of an atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel.[178] Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically from the rest of the global community. In 2009, The US Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if chosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon only by 2013 four years later.[179], 119972=On 22 September 1980 the Iraqi army invaded Iranian Khuzestan, the start of the IranÃ¢Â€Â“Iraq War. Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, by mid 1982 the Iranian forces successfully managed to drive the Iraqi army back into Iraq. In July 1982 with Iraq thrown on the defensive, Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988, when Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border, subsequently Khomeini accepted a truce mediated by the UN. The total Iranian casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220Ã¢Â€Â“160,000 KIA, 60,711 MIA and 11,000-16,000 civilians killed.[135][136], 339200=Nowruz is the main national holiday of Iran; an ancient Iranian tradition celebrated on 21 March to mark the beginning of the spring, and the New Year in Iran. It is a secular holiday, and is enjoyed by people with different faiths; however, it is a holiday for Zoroastrians. It was registered on the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,[327] and described as the Persian New Year[328][329][330][331] by UNESCO in 2009., 214669=In 2006, about 45% of the government's budget came from oil and natural gas revenues, and 31% came from taxes and fees.[198] As of 2007, Iran had earned $70 billion in foreign exchange reserves mostly (80%) from crude oil exports.[199] Iranian budget deficits have been a chronic problem, mostly due to large-scale state subsidies, that include foodstuffs and especially gasoline, totaling more than $84 billion in 2008 for the energy sector alone.[200][201] In 2010, the economic reform plan was approved by parliament to cut subsidies gradually and replace them with targeted social assistance. The objective is to move towards free market prices in a 5-year period and increase productivity and social justice.[202], 284382=Iranian art has one of the richest art heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and stonemasonry. There is also a very vibrant Iranian modern and contemporary art scene. The modern art movement in Iran had its genesis in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The 1949 opening of the Apadana gallery in Tehran by Mahmoud Javadipour and other colleagues, and the emergence of artists like Marcos Grigorian in the 1950s, signaled a commitment to the creation of a form of modern art grounded in Iran.[293], 124878=Hassan Rouhani was elected as President of Iran on 15 June 2013, defeating Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and four other candidates.[142][143] The electoral victory of new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has improved Iran's relations with other countries.[144], 201438=As of 2009 Iran maintains diplomatic relations with 99 members of the United Nations,[180] but not with the United States or Israel, a state which Iran does not recognize since the 1979 Revolution.[181] On July 14, 2015 Tehran and the P5+1 came to a historic agreement to end economic sanctions after demonstrating a peaceful nuclear research project that meets International Atomic Energy Agency standards.[182], 330032=The art of animation, as practiced in modern day Iran, started in the 1950s. After four decades of animation production in Iran and three-decade experience of Kanoon Institute, Tehran International Animation Festival (TIAF) was established in February 1999. Every two years, participants from more than 70 countries attend this event which holds the biggest national animation market in Tehran.[317][318], 322380=In 1904, Mirza Ebrahim Khan (Sahhaf Bashi) opened the first movie theater in Tehran.[310] After him, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were little more than 15 theatres in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[309], 169393=The sixth major Iranian city is Shiraz (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of Fars Province. The Babylonian civilization to the west greatly influenced the area, which soon came to be known as Persis. The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 9th century BC, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BC. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in or near Shiraz. Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire and is situated 70 kilometres (43Ã‚Â mi) northeast of modern Shiraz. UNESCO declared the citadel of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979., 83611=In 1219Ã¢Â€Â“21 the Khwarezmian Empire suffered a devastating invasion by Genghis Khan's Mongol army. According to Steven R. Ward, ""Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people. Some historians have estimated that Iran's population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until the mid-20th century.""[98] Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256 Hulagu Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson, established the Ilkhanate dynasty in Iran. In 1370 yet another conqueror, Timur, commonly known as Tamerlane in the West, followed Hulagu's example, establishing the Timurid Dynasty which lasted for another 156 years. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan, reportedly killing 70,000 citizens.[99] Hulagu, Timur and their successors soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Persians, choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively Persian.[100], 205911=The Islamic Republic of Iran has two types of armed forces: the regular forces Islamic Republic of Iran Army, Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, Islamic Republic of Iran Navy and the Revolutionary Guards, totaling about 545,000 active troops. Iran also has around 350,000 Reserve Force totaling around 900,000 trained troops.[184] Iran has a paramilitary, volunteer militia force within the IRGC, called the Basij, which includes about 90,000 full-time, active-duty uniformed members. Up to 11 million men and women are members of the Basij who could potentially be called up for service; GlobalSecurity.org estimates Iran could mobilize ""up to one million men"". This would be among the largest troop mobilizations in the world.[185] In 2007, Iran's military spending represented 2.6% of the GDP or $102 per capita, the lowest figure of the Persian Gulf nations.[186] Iran's military doctrine is based on deterrence.[187] In 2014 arms spending the country spent $15 billion and was outspent by the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council by a factor of 13.[188], 54671=From the 2nd millennium BC, the Assyrians incorporated swaths of western Iran into their territories up to 612 BC, as well as settled in the region., 303103=The Persian language has produced a number of famous poets; however, only a few poets as Rumi and Omar KhayyÃƒÂ¡m have surfaced among western popular readership, even though the likes of Hafez, Saadi, Nizami,[303] Attar, Sanai, Nasir Khusraw and Jami are considered by many Iranians to be just as influential.[citation needed], 324338=After the Revolution of 1979, as the new government imposed new laws and standards, a new age in Iranian cinema emerged, starting with Viva... by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many other Iranian directors who emerged in the last few decades, such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, who some critics regard as one of the few great directors in the history of Iranian cinema,[311] planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the Palme d'Or for Taste of Cherry in 1997. The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin Film Festival, attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces.[312] In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.[313][314], 92830=In 1729, an Iranian Khorasan chieftain and military genius, Nader Shah, successfully drove out, then conquered the Pashtun invaders. He subsequently made Iran's geo-political neighbouring rivals, the Ottomans as well as the Russians, cede back the annexed territories in the Caucasus, which they had divided amongst themselves amidst the ongoing chaos in Iran., 250441=Iran hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan and Iraq.[255] Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation.[256] According to estimates, about five million Iranian citizens have emigrated to other countries, mostly since the 1979 Revolution.[257][258], 222129=Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2009 mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America.[211][212][213], 71895=Several offshots and descendants of the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanians established eponymous dynasties and branches in Anatolia and the Caucasus, of which some are the Kingdom of Pontus, the Arsacid dynasties of Armenia, Iberia (Georgia), and Caucasian Albania (present-day Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan), and the Mihranids., 320573=The earliest examples of visual representations in Iranian history may be traced back to the bas-reliefs in Persepolis (c. 500 BC). Persepolis was the ritual center of the ancient kingdom of Achaemenids and the figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.[308] During the Sasanian reign, Iranian visual arts reached a pinnacle. A bas-relief from this period in Taq e Bostan depicts a complex hunting scene. Similar works from the period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see a progenitor of the cinema close-up in one of these works of art, which shows a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground.[309], 126979=Iran is the 18th largest country in the world, with an area of 1,648,195Ã‚Â km2 (636,372Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi).[35] Its area roughly equals that of the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany combined, or somewhat more than the US state of Alaska.[145] Iran lies between latitudes 24Ã‚Â° and 40Ã‚Â° N, and longitudes 44Ã‚Â° and 64Ã‚Â° E. Its borders are with Azerbaijan (611Ã‚Â km (380Ã‚Â mi)) (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave (179Ã‚Â km (111Ã‚Â mi) ))[146] and Armenia (35Ã‚Â km (22Ã‚Â mi)) to the north-west; the Caspian Sea to the north; Turkmenistan (992Ã‚Â km (616Ã‚Â mi)) to the north-east; Pakistan (909Ã‚Â km (565Ã‚Â mi)) and Afghanistan (936Ã‚Â km (582Ã‚Â mi)) to the east; Turkey (499Ã‚Â km (310Ã‚Â mi)) and Iraq (1,458Ã‚Â km (906Ã‚Â mi)) to the west; and finally the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south., 244140=Iranian scientists outside Iran have also made some major contributions to science. In 1960, Ali Javan co-invented the first gas laser, and fuzzy set theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh.[245] Iranian cardiologist, Tofy Mussivand invented and developed the first artificial cardiac pump, the precursor of the artificial heart. Furthering research and treatment of diabetes, HbA1c was discovered by Samuel Rahbar. Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory, with many papers being published in Iran.[246] Iranian-American string theorist Kamran Vafa proposed the Vafa-Witten theorem together with Edward Witten. In August 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first-ever woman, as well as the first-ever Iranian, to receive the Fields Medal, the highest prize in mathematics.[247], 227289=Iran has the largest proved gas reserves in the world, with 33.6 trillion cubic metres.[34] It also ranks fourth in oil reserves with an estimated 153,600,000,000 barrels.[219][220] It is OPEC's 2nd largest oil exporter and is an energy superpower.[221][222] In 2005, Iran spent US$4 billion on fuel imports, because of contraband and inefficient domestic use.[223] Oil industry output averaged 4 million barrels per day (640,000Ã‚Â m3/d) in 2005, compared with the peak of six million barrels per day reached in 1974. In the early years of the 2000s (decade), industry infrastructure was increasingly inefficient because of technological lags.

[...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle.""[7] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album for two and a half years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008.[8] As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne.[7] According to Gaga, the first track ""Just Dance"" is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeal to people going through tough times in their life.[9] ""LoveGame"", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, ""I wanna ride on your disco stick"". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook.[10] ""Paparazzi"" has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love.

Por dar un ejemplo, el tÃƒÂ­tulo de AFL ganado por los New York Jets en 1968 se suma al Super Bowl ganado en 1969. A pesar de ser tÃƒÂ­tulos de la misma temporada, ambos galardones cuentan como dos tÃƒÂ­tulos apartes y no como uno de la temporada. En la siguiente lista se enumeran las franquicias con mÃƒÂ¡s tÃƒÂ­tulos en las ligas de fÃƒÂºtbol americano profesional de Estados Unidos reconocidas por el Pro Football Hall of Fame. Ganadores del Super Bowl ArtÃƒÂ­culo principal: Campeones de la NFL ArtÃƒÂ­culo principal: Campeones de la NFL[editar] La postemporada culmina con el mÃƒÂ¡ximo evento de la NFL, el partido del Super Bowl, que precisa de planificaciÃƒÂ³n, programaciÃƒÂ³n e implementaciÃƒÂ³n exhaustivas, siendo necesario recibir las candidaturas de los equipos y las ciudades que aspiran a figurar como sedes con varios aÃƒÂ±os de anticipaciÃƒÂ³n. Super Bowl ArtÃƒÂ­culo","Pro Bowl[editar] Placaje durante el Pro Bowl del 2006. ArtÃƒÂ­culo principal: Pro Bowl La temporada finaliza oficialmente con el Pro Bowl (en MÃƒÂ©xico: Ã¢Â€ÂœTazÃƒÂ³n de los ProfesionalesÃ¢Â€?) que se efectÃƒÂºa una semana antes del Super Bowl. Desde 1980, se ha venido disputando en Honolulu, HawÃƒÂ¡i.[26] Sin embargo, la liga ha decidido mantener el Pro Bowl de 2009 en Honolulu.[27] Anteriormente el Pro Bowl consistÃƒÂ­a en que los mejores jugadores de la AFC se enfrentaban a los mejores de la NFC, pero a partir de la temporada 2013-2014 el partido consiste en hacer un draft (selecciÃƒÂ³n) de jugadores sin importar a que conferencia pertenezcan, los equipos llevan el nombre de sus lÃƒÂ­deres (que son los que seleccionan a los jugadores) que en el caso de la temporada 2013-2014 fueron Jerry Rice y Deion Sanders, quienes actualmente pertenecen al salÃƒÂ³n de la fama. Sistema de nÃƒÂºmeros en los uniformes[editar] En la NFL, los jugadores usan los nÃƒÂºmeros en sus camisetas segÃƒÂºn la posiciÃƒÂ³n en la que juegan.",True,0,0,"{5350=La National Football League (en espaÃƒÂ±ol: Liga Nacional de FÃƒÂºtbol Americano), mejor conocida por sus siglas en inglÃƒÂ©s, NFL, es la mayor liga de fÃƒÂºtbol americano profesional de los Estados Unidos. La NFL toma la figura jurÃƒÂ­dica de AsociaciÃƒÂ³n Deportiva, controlada por sus propios miembros.[1] Fue creada por once equipos en 1920 como la American Professional Football Association (la liga cambiÃƒÂ³ su nombre por el de American Professional Football League en 1921 para modificarlo una vez mÃƒÂ¡s por el nombre ahora vigente en 1922). Actualmente la NFL estÃƒÂ¡ formada por 32 franquicias establecidas en diversas ciudades y regiones estadounidenses. Se divide en dos Conferencias: la Nacional (NFC) y la Americana (AFC). A su vez cada Conferencia se integra por cuatro Divisiones (Norte, Sur, Este y Oeste) y cada una de ellas, por cuatro diferentes equipos., 49792=La AFL introdujo novedosos cambios a este deporte, contribuyendo aÃƒÂºn mÃƒÂ¡s a una competente rivalidad con la NFL. Se trataba de la instalaciÃƒÂ³n de un reloj oficial visible para los aficionados durante el juego, los nombres de los jugadores en los jerseys y un sistema ofensivo mÃƒÂ¡s agresivo por aire facilitado por la nueva regla de sustituciones libres durante el encuentro, lo que llevÃƒÂ³ finalmente a la especializaciÃƒÂ³n de las posiciones. Otra circunstancia que la diferenciaba de la NFL era su actitud hacia el colectivo de la raza negra: la AFL incluyÃƒÂ³ a jugadores negros y reclutaba activamente a jugadores en Universidades histÃƒÂ³ricamente descartadas y marginadas por la NFL. Posteriormente, los equipos de la NFL incluyeron a jugadores negros en posiciones tÃƒÂ¡citamente prohibidas para ellos en la NFL, como la de quarterback[9] y middle linebacker.[10] En enero de 1965 hubo un boicot del partido de las estrellas de la AFL de 1964 en Nueva Orleans con motivo de la discriminaciÃƒÂ³n hacia los jugadores negros por parte de algunos hoteles y negocios de la ciudad. Fue un acto de activismo por las libertades y derechos sociales que ha sido homenajeado por el Pro Football Hall of Fame. La nueva liga tambiÃƒÂ©n se asegurÃƒÂ³ financieramente al decidir compartir, con los demÃƒÂ¡s equipos, las ganancias recibidas por los derechos televisivos y de taquilla en sus encuentros., 89677=En la NFL, los jugadores usan los nÃƒÂºmeros en sus camisetas segÃƒÂºn la posiciÃƒÂ³n en la que juegan. El sistema actual se instituyÃƒÂ³ en la liga el 5 de abril de 1973, como un medio para que los aficionados y ÃƒÂ¡rbitros puedan identificar mÃƒÂ¡s fÃƒÂ¡cilmente los jugadores en el campo por su posiciÃƒÂ³n. Desde esa fecha, los jugadores usan los nÃƒÂºmeros asignados dentro de los rangos siguientes, sobre la base de su posiciÃƒÂ³n primaria:, 66131=El sistema de elecciÃƒÂ³n es el siguiente: el equipo con peor balance de victorias/derrotas de la ÃƒÂºltima temporada disputada es quien elige primero, siendo el segundo en elegir el que segundo peor balance presente y asÃƒÂ­ sucesivamente. Con fiesta parda del resultado final de la temporada regular, las dos ÃƒÂºltimas elecciones se reservan para los dos equipos que han disputado el Super Bowl, siendo su ganador el ÃƒÂºltimo en escoger. El Draft consiste en siete rondas. Las dos primeras se llevan a cabo en sÃƒÂ¡bado, mientras que las 5 restantes se organizan el domingo. Los equipos tienen un tiempo limitado para elegir a los jugadores.[21] Si no escogen en el tiempo predeterminado, pasan su turno a los equipos siguientes. Esto le ocurriÃƒÂ³ a los Minnesota Vikings en 2003.[22], 26246=La mayorÃƒÂ­a de las grandes ÃƒÂ¡reas metropolitanas de Estados Unidos tienen un equipo en la NFL. Los Ãƒ?ngeles, la segunda ÃƒÂ¡rea metropolitana en cuanto a extensiÃƒÂ³n del paÃƒÂ­s no ha gozado de tal privilegio desde 1994. Los Rams y los Raiders tuvieron su casa en Los Ãƒ?ngeles de 1946 a 1994 y de 1982 a 1994, respectivamente. En 2005, algunos partidos de los Saints tuvieron que disputarse en San Antonio (Texas) con motivo del HuracÃƒÂ¡n Katrina. Por otro lado, se especula con la posibilidad acerca de crear una franquicia de la NFL en Toronto, la ciudad mÃƒÂ¡s grande de CanadÃƒÂ¡. El equipo que, segÃƒÂºn las especulaciones, tiene mÃƒÂ¡s bazas para moverse a dicha ciudad son los Buffalo Bills, que actualmente juegan a 130 km al sur de Buffalo y suelen organizar un partido anual en el Rogers Centre de Toronto.[6], 60955=Una de las razones que ha diferenciado a la NFL respecto de otras grandes ligas estadounidenses es la aparente paridad entre sus 32 equipos. A pesar de ser testigo de equipos dominantes de vez en cuando, la liga ha sido citada como una de las pocas en las que cualquier equipo tiene posibilidades reales de ganar el campeonato cada aÃƒÂ±o.[14] El acuerdo laboral acordado entre la liga y la UniÃƒÂ³n de Jugadores (NFLPA), que instaura un sistema de tope salarial, asÃƒÂ­ como al reparto de dividendos entre todos los equipos, ha prevenido a los clubes mÃƒÂ¡s ricos de firmar a los mejores jugadores, consiguiendo asÃƒÂ­ que equipos de pequeÃƒÂ±as ciudades como los Green Bay Packers o New Orleans Saints tengan la oportunidad de competir por el Super Bowl. [15] Uno de los artÃƒÂ­fices de ese acuerdo fue el antiguo gerente de la NFL Paul Tagliabue, quien presidiÃƒÂ³ la liga entre 1989-2006.[16] Con los nuevos acuerdos realizados en 1993, renovados en 1998 y 2006, la liga ha conseguido mantener los niveles salariales mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de todas las grandes ligas estadounidenses[17] y ha contribuido a que la NFL sea la ÃƒÂºnica de ellas que no ha sufrido una huelga de jugadores paralizadora de actividades desde 1993.[18], 51868=La AFL forzÃƒÂ³ la expansiÃƒÂ³n de la NFL: los Dallas Cowboys fueron creados para competir con los Dallas Texans de la AFL creados al mismo tiempo. En 1963, los Dallas Texans cambiaron su sede por la de Kansas City y fueron renombrados como los Kansas City Chiefs; los Minnesota Vikings fueron una donaciÃƒÂ³n hecha en favor de Max Winter por abandonar la AFL; los Atlanta Falcons fueron donde Rankin Smith para disuadirle de adquirir los Miami Dolphins., 10482=La NFL ostenta la mayor asistencia de pÃƒÂºblico por partido de todas las ligas profesionales del mundo, atrayendo a 67.000 espectadores en cada partido en las temporadas 2006[4] y la de 2007.[5] No obstante, la asistencia de pÃƒÂºblico total en tÃƒÂ©rminos brutos de la NFL sÃƒÂ³lo supone aproximadamente el 20% de la Major League Baseball (MLB), dado que ÃƒÂ©sta disputa diez veces mÃƒÂ¡s partidos., 8658=A pesar de habÃƒÂ©rsele considerado al bÃƒÂ©isbol como el Pasatiempo Nacional de los Estados Unidos, el fÃƒÂºtbol americano es el deporte mÃƒÂ¡s popular en dicho paÃƒÂ­s. SegÃƒÂºn una encuesta (Harris Poll, secundada por la empresa Harris Interactive), el fÃƒÂºtbol americano profesional se situÃƒÂ³ por delante del baseball como deporte favorito en 1965, cuando la American Football League, por aquel entonces liga rival de la NFL, emergiÃƒÂ³ como una gran liga de fÃƒÂºtbol americano profesional. El fÃƒÂºtbol americano se ha mantenido como deporte favorito desde entonces. En una Harris Poll de 2008, la NFL era el deporte favorito de casi la misma gente (30%) que de los siguientes cuatro deportes juntos -beisbol (15%), automovilismo (10%), hockey (5%) y baloncesto profesional masculino (4%)-.[2] AdemÃƒÂ¡s, los ratings televisivos de fÃƒÂºtbol americano en Estados Unidos sobrepasan los de otros deportes.[3] AdemÃƒÂ¡s de eso, el fÃƒÂºtbol americano universitario es en la actualidad el tercer deporte mÃƒÂ¡s popular en Estados Unidos, con un 12% de los encuestados considerÃƒÂ¡ndolo como su favorito. Por ello, un total de 42% de estadounidenses consideran algÃƒÂºn nivel de fÃƒÂºtbol americano (profesional o universitario) como su deporte favorito., 67325=Los equipos tienen la posibilidad de intercambiar sus elecciones con otros equipos ya sea por otras elecciones o por jugadores, dinero o una combinaciÃƒÂ³n de todas las anteriores. AsÃƒÂ­ como los transpasos de jugadores por jugadores son inusuales durante el resto del aÃƒÂ±o (en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con otras ligas deportivas), los intercambios son mÃƒÂ¡s frecuentes el fin de semana del Draft. En 1989, los Dallas Cowboys traspasaron al running back Herschel Walker a los Minnesota Vikings por cinco jugadores y seis elecciones de Draft para un periodo de 3 aÃƒÂ±os. Los Cowboys usarÃƒÂ­an tales elecciones para intercambiarlas de nuevo por nuevos jugadores y mÃƒÂ¡s elecciones. Consecuencia directa de ese traspaso, draftearon a muchas de las estrellas que mÃƒÂ¡s tarde ayudarÃƒÂ­an a Dallas a conseguir tres Super Bowls en la dÃƒÂ©cada de los 90, entre los que se encontraban Emmitt Smith, Russell Maryland y Darren Woodson.[23], 28513=Desde la temporada 2002 los equipos estÃƒÂ¡n organizados de la siguiente manera.[8], 92925=Desde 1994, la empresa de televisiÃƒÂ³n satelital DirecTV ofrece el paquete extra NFL Sunday Ticket, que muestra todos los partidos de los domingos de tarde., 91600=La NFL comenzÃƒÂ³ a emitirse regularmente por televisiÃƒÂ³n en la dÃƒÂ©cada de 1940. La final se emitiÃƒÂ³ en televisiÃƒÂ³n por primera vez en 1948. En 1955 la final se emitiÃƒÂ³ por la cadena nacional NBC, y en 1956 CBS comenzÃƒÂ³ a emitir partidos. La primera ediciÃƒÂ³n del Super Bowl, producto de la fusiÃƒÂ³n de la NFL con la AFL en 1967, se emitiÃƒÂ³ por ambas cadenas, tras lo cual comenzaron a alternarse. ABC comenzÃƒÂ³ a emitir partidos los lunes de noche en 1970, y se uniÃƒÂ³ a la rotaciÃƒÂ³n del Super Bowl en 1985., 54246=A mediados de los aÃƒÂ±os 60 la tensiÃƒÂ³n llegÃƒÂ³ a su lÃƒÂ­mite. La competiciÃƒÂ³n que enfrentaba a ambas ligas para la adquisiciÃƒÂ³n de jugadores, incluyendo Drafts colegiales diferentes, llevÃƒÂ³ a incrementos salariales considerables. En 1965, en una de las luchas mÃƒÂ¡s disputadas, con saldo a favor de la AFL, el quarterback de la Universidad de Alabama Joe Namath firmÃƒÂ³ con los New York Jets prefiriÃƒÂ©ndoles antes que a los St. Louis Cardinals de la NFL por un rÃƒÂ©cord salarial de $427.000. EN 1966, el gerente de la AFL Al Davis se puso como objetivo realizar una campaÃƒÂ±a para quitar jugadores a la NFL, sobre todo quarterbacks, pero, a sus espaldas, varios propietarios de distintos equipos empezaron a tomar contacto para poner fin a esa frÃƒÂ­a rivalidad entre las dos grandes ligas., 90795=Los nÃƒÂºmeros 0 (cero) y 00 (doble cero) no son utilizados por los jugadores de la NFL desde 1973., 92315=La cadena de cable ESPN comenzÃƒÂ³ a emitir partidos en 1987, y TNT lo hizo entre 1990 y 1997. La cadena de aire Fox sustituyÃƒÂ³ a CBS entre 1994 y 1997. CBS retornÃƒÂ³ en 1998 en lugar de NBC y TNT. En 2006 retornÃƒÂ³ NBC en lugar de ABC, a la vez que se incorporÃƒÂ³ la cadena paga NFL Network., 87898=La temporada finaliza oficialmente con el Pro Bowl (en MÃƒÂ©xico: Ã¢Â€ÂœTazÃƒÂ³n de los ProfesionalesÃ¢Â€?) que se efectÃƒÂºa una semana antes del Super Bowl. Desde 1980, se ha venido disputando en Honolulu, HawÃƒÂ¡i.[26] Sin embargo, la liga ha decidido mantener el Pro Bowl de 2009 en Honolulu.[27] Anteriormente el Pro Bowl consistÃƒÂ­a en que los mejores jugadores de la AFC se enfrentaban a los mejores de la NFC, pero a partir de la temporada 2013-2014 el partido consiste en hacer un draft (selecciÃƒÂ³n) de jugadores sin importar a que conferencia pertenezcan, los equipos llevan el nombre de sus lÃƒÂ­deres (que son los que seleccionan a los jugadores) que en el caso de la temporada 2013-2014 fueron Jerry Rice y Deion Sanders, quienes actualmente pertenecen al salÃƒÂ³n de la fama., 63193=Desde la llegada de Roger Goodell a la presidencia de la NFL en la temporada 2006, se ha establecido como una prioridad regular la conducta de los jugadores. Varios jugadores de gran talento han experimentado problemas legales, desde Adam ""Pacman"" Jones a Michael Vick. En estos casos en particular y en otros en general, el presidente Goodell ha castigado severamente las conductas con sanciones duraderas a quienes hayan infringido gravemente la polÃƒÂ­tica de conducta de la NFL.[19], 65544=Durante el mes de abril, los distintos equipos de la NFL buscan aÃƒÂ±adir a sus plantillas jugadores universitarios a travÃƒÂ©s del draft de la NFL, oficialmente llamado NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting,[20] y que se viene celebrando cada aÃƒÂ±o en la ciudad de Nueva York desde 1965., 48926=El crecimiento de la NFL a principios de 1958, fue tan rÃƒÂ¡pido y contundente que logrÃƒÂ³ superar al bÃƒÂ©isbol como el deporte favorito de los aficionados de los Estados Unidos de AmÃƒÂ©rica. Esto despertÃƒÂ³ igualmente el interÃƒÂ©s de empresarios y su apetito por adquirir alguna franquicia existente o crear alguna nueva. Tal fue el caso del empresario tejano Lamar Hunt, quien presentÃƒÂ³ una oferta de compra, que a la postre fue rechazada. Esto originÃƒÂ³ que Hunt y algunos otros hombres de negocios decidieran formar con diez equipos una asociaciÃƒÂ³n nueva a la que llamaron American Football League (AFL), que se convertirÃƒÂ­a en una seria rival de la NFL., 55397=En un acuerdo formalizado por el fundador de la AFL Lamar Hunt y el gerente de los Dallas Cowboys Tex Schramm, las dos ligas anunciaron oficialmente su fusiÃƒÂ³n el 8 de junio de 1966. Las ligas tendrÃƒÂ­an un Draft comÃƒÂºn y organizarÃƒÂ­an un partido de final de temporada que decidiera el campeÃƒÂ³n de entre ambas ligas (posteriormente se llamarÃƒÂ­a Super Bowl), que con el paso de los aÃƒÂ±os se convertirÃƒÂ­a en el mÃƒÂ¡s alto sÃƒÂ­mbolo del fÃƒÂºtbol americano y la celebraciÃƒÂ³n que mÃƒÂ¡s espectadores convoca cada aÃƒÂ±o a nivel mundial. TodavÃƒÂ­a hubo una ciudad mÃƒÂ¡s que recibirÃƒÂ­a una franquicia gracias a la AFL, Nueva Orleans, que fue obsequiada con un nuevo equipo en la NFL por la aprobaciÃƒÂ³n de la Public Law 89-800 impulsada por Congresistas federales de Luisiana, que permitÃƒÂ­a la fusiÃƒÂ³n y que desautorizaba toda excepciÃƒÂ³n relacionada con restricciones anti-monopolistas. En 1970, las ligas se fusionaron totalmente en una nueva adoptando el nombre actual de National Football League, dividiÃƒÂ©ndose en dos Conferencias con un nÃƒÂºmero igual de equipos cada una. Hubo tambiÃƒÂ©n un acuerdo financiero por el que los equipos de la AFL pagarÃƒÂ­an un total en conjunto de $18 millones durante 20 aÃƒÂ±os. TambiÃƒÂ©n hubo una objeciÃƒÂ³n por parte de muchos aficionados de la AFL acerca de la pÃƒÂ©rdida, con motivo de la fusiÃƒÂ³n, de la identidad de su liga, su logo y su nombre., 95187=Desde 2006, algunos partidos tambiÃƒÂ©n se emiten en espaÃƒÂ±ol en la cadena de cable ESPN Deportes., 93912=CBS y Fox transmiten los partidos de los domingos de tarde. CBS emite los partidos entre equipos de la AFC y Fox los de la NFC.

Planifier[modifier | modifier le code] Deux citations de George Box, Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Tous les modÃƒÂ¨les sont faux, mais certains sont utilesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Les statisticiens sont comme les artistes, ils tombent amoureux de leurs modÃƒÂ¨lesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», illustrent avec humour le fait que quelquefois certains analystes en fouille de donnÃƒÂ©es ont besoin de croire en leur modÃƒÂ¨le et de croire que le modÃƒÂ¨le qu'ils travaillent est le meilleur. Utiliser un ensemble de modÃƒÂ¨les et interprÃƒÂ©ter la distribution des rÃƒÂ©sultats est nettement plus sÃƒÂ»r[43]. Il est impossible d'utiliser et dÃ¢Â€Â™interprÃƒÂ©ter les rÃƒÂ©sultats d'un modÃƒÂ¨le en dehors du cadre dans lequel il a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© construit[b 2]. InterprÃƒÂ©ter des rÃƒÂ©sultats en fonction d'autres cas similaires mais diffÃƒÂ©rents est aussi cause d'erreurs, mais ce n'est pas propre aux raisonnements liÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  l'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es. Enfin, extrapoler des rÃƒÂ©sultats, obtenus sur des espaces de faibles dimensions, sur des espaces de dimensions ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s peut aussi conduire ÃƒÂ  des erreurs. ÃƒÂ‰liminer ÃƒÂ  priori les rÃƒÂ©sultats qui paraissent absurdes[42], en comparaison avec ce qui est attendu, peut ÃƒÂªtre source d'erreurs car ce sont peut-ÃƒÂªtre ces rÃƒÂ©sultats qui donnent","Le cÃ…Â“ur de l'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es est constituÃƒÂ© par la modÃƒÂ©lisationÃ‚Â : toute la prÃƒÂ©paration est effectuÃƒÂ©e en fonction du modÃƒÂ¨le que l'analyste envisage de produire, les tÃƒÂ¢ches effectuÃƒÂ©es ensuite valident le modÃƒÂ¨le choisi, le complÃƒÂ¨tent et le dÃƒÂ©ploient. La tÃƒÂ¢che la plus lourde de consÃƒÂ©quences dans la modÃƒÂ©lisation consiste ÃƒÂ  dÃƒÂ©terminer le ou les algorithmes qui produiront le modÃƒÂ¨le attendu. La question importante est donc celle des critÃƒÂ¨res qui permettent de choisir cet ou ces algorithmes. Algorithmes[modifier | modifier le code] RÃƒÂ©soudre un problÃƒÂ¨me par un processus d'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es impose gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralement l'utilisation d'un grand nombre de mÃƒÂ©thodes et d'algorithmes diffÃƒÂ©rents plus ou moins faciles ÃƒÂ  comprendre et ÃƒÂ  employer[45]. Il existe deux grandes familles d'algorithmesÃ‚Â : les mÃƒÂ©thodes descriptives et les mÃƒÂ©thodes prÃƒÂ©dictives. MÃƒÂ©thodes descriptives[modifier | modifier le code] Article dÃƒÂ©taillÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â : Analyse des donnÃƒÂ©es.

Une ÃƒÂ©quipe s'est orientÃƒÂ©e sur une recherche d'algorithmes extrÃƒÂªmement fins ÃƒÂ  partir des informations de la base, une autre au contraire a pris des algorithmes extrÃƒÂªmement simples, mais a combinÃƒÂ© la base fournie par le distributeur au contenu de lÃ¢Â€Â™Internet Movie Database (IMDB) pour enrichir ses informations. La seconde ÃƒÂ©quipe a obtenu des rÃƒÂ©sultats nettement plus prÃƒÂ©cis. Un article[64] suggÃƒÂ¨re que l'efficacitÃƒÂ© de Google tient moins ÃƒÂ  son algorithme PageRank qu'ÃƒÂ  la trÃƒÂ¨s grande quantitÃƒÂ© d'information que Google peut corrÃƒÂ©ler par croisement des historiques de requÃƒÂªtes, et par l'analyse du comportement de navigation de ses utilisateurs sur les diffÃƒÂ©rents sites., 35491=De bonnes pratiques ont ÃƒÂ©mergÃƒÂ© au fil du temps pour amÃƒÂ©liorer la qualitÃƒÂ© des projets. Parmi celles-ci, les mÃƒÂ©thodologies aident les ÃƒÂ©quipes ÃƒÂ  organiser les projets en processus. Au nombre des mÃƒÂ©thodes les plus utilisÃƒÂ©es se trouvent la mÃƒÂ©thodologie SEMMA du SAS Institute et la CRISP-DM qui est la mÃƒÂ©thode la plus employÃƒÂ©e dans les annÃƒÂ©es 2010., 103210=La fouille de donnÃƒÂ©es n'existerait pas sans outil. L'offre informatique est prÃƒÂ©sente sous la forme de logiciels[67] et aussi sur quelques plateformes spÃƒÂ©cialisÃƒÂ©es[68]. De nombreux logiciels sont prÃƒÂ©sents dans la sphÃƒÂ¨re des logiciels commerciaux, mais il en existe aussi dans celle des logiciels libres. Il n'y a pas de logiciels meilleurs que d'autres, tout dÃƒÂ©pend de ce qu'on veut en faire[69]. Les logiciels commerciaux sont plutÃƒÂ´t destinÃƒÂ©s aux entreprises, ou aux organismes ayant de gros volumes de donnÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ  explorer[b 10], tandis que les logiciels libres sont destinÃƒÂ©s plus particuliÃƒÂ¨rement aux ÃƒÂ©tudiants, ÃƒÂ  ceux qui veulent expÃƒÂ©rimenter des techniques nouvelles, et aux PME[b 10]. En 2009[70], les outils les plus utilisÃƒÂ©s sont, dans l'ordre, SPSS, RapidMinerÃ‚Â (en), SAS, Excel, R, KXENÃ‚Â (en), Weka, Matlab, KNIMEÃ‚Â (en), Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle DMÃ‚Â (en) et STATISTICA. En 2010, R[71] est l'outil le plus utilisÃƒÂ© parmi les utilisateurs ayant rÃƒÂ©pondu au sondage de Rexer Analytics[72] et STATISTICA apparaÃƒÂ®t comme l'outil prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© de la plupart des prospecteurs de donnÃƒÂ©es (18Ã‚Â %). STATISTICA, IBM SPSS Modeler, et R ont reÃƒÂ§u les taux de satisfaction les plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  la fois en 2010 et 2009 dans ce sondage de Rexer Analytics., 28687=DÃ¢Â€Â™autre part, de nombreux groupements interprofessionnels et d'associations se sont crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©s pour rÃƒÂ©flÃƒÂ©chir et accompagner le dÃƒÂ©veloppement de l'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es. Le premier de ces groupements professionnels dans le domaine est le groupe dÃ¢Â€Â™intÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂªt de l'Association for Computing Machinery sur la gestion des connaissances et l'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es, le SIGKDD[15]. Depuis 1989 il organise une confÃƒÂ©rence internationale annuelle et publie les nouveaux rÃƒÂ©sultats, rÃƒÂ©flexions et dÃƒÂ©veloppements de ses membres[16]. Ainsi, depuis 1999, cet organisme publie une revue semestrielle dont le titre est Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â SIGKDD ExplorationsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[17]., 15431=L'industrie a pris conscience de l'importance du patrimoine constituÃƒÂ© par ses donnÃƒÂ©es et cherche ÃƒÂ  l'exploiter en utilisant l'informatique dÃƒÂ©cisionnelle et l'exploration des donnÃƒÂ©es. Les compagnies les plus avancÃƒÂ©es dans ce domaine se situent dans le secteur tertiaire. Selon le site kdnuggets.com[13] la rÃƒÂ©partition aux ÃƒÂ‰tats-Unis, en pourcentage du total des rÃƒÂ©ponses au sondage, de l'utilisation de l'exploration des donnÃƒÂ©es par secteurs d'activitÃƒÂ©s s'effectue en 2010 comme ceciÃ‚Â :, 26115=Comme le montre l'histogramme ci-dessus, l'industrie est trÃƒÂ¨s intÃƒÂ©ressÃƒÂ©e par le sujet, notamment en matiÃƒÂ¨re de standard et d'interopÃƒÂ©rabilitÃƒÂ©[notes 4] qui facilitent l'emploi d'outils informatiques provenant d'ÃƒÂ©diteurs diffÃƒÂ©rents. En outre, les entreprises, l'enseignement et la recherche ont grandement contribuÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  l'ÃƒÂ©volution et ÃƒÂ  l'amÃƒÂ©lioration (en termes de rigueur par exemple) des mÃƒÂ©thodes et des modÃƒÂ¨lesÃ‚Â ; un article publiÃƒÂ© en 2008 par l'International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making rÃƒÂ©sume une ÃƒÂ©tude qui trace et analyse cette ÃƒÂ©volution[14]. Certains acteurs sont passÃƒÂ©s de la recherche ÃƒÂ  l'industrie., 94504=La liste des algorithmes ÃƒÂ©volue chaque jour, car ils n'ont pas tous le mÃƒÂªme objet, ne s'appliquent pas aux mÃƒÂªmes donnÃƒÂ©es en entrÃƒÂ©e et aucun n'est optimal dans tous les cas. En outre, ils s'avÃƒÂ¨rent complÃƒÂ©mentaires les uns aux autres en pratique et en les combinant intelligemment en construisant des modÃƒÂ¨les de modÃƒÂ¨les ou mÃƒÂ©tamodÃƒÂ¨les, il est possible d'obtenir des gains en performance et en qualitÃƒÂ© trÃƒÂ¨s significatifs. L'ICDM-IEEE a fait en 2006 un classement des 10 algorithmes[51] ayant le plus d'influence dans le monde de l'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©esÃ‚Â : ce classement est une aide efficace au choix et ÃƒÂ  la comprÃƒÂ©hension de ces algorithmes.}","Fri, 17 Jul 2015 21:05:26 GMT","{9600=De 1919 ÃƒÂ  1925, Ronald Fisher met au point l'analyse de la variance comme outil pour son projet d'infÃƒÂ©rence statistique mÃƒÂ©dicale. Les annÃƒÂ©es 1950 voient l'apparition de calculateurs encore onÃƒÂ©reux et des techniques de calcul par lots sur ces machines. SimultanÃƒÂ©ment, des mÃƒÂ©thodes et des techniques voient le jour telles que la segmentation, classification (entre autres par la mÃƒÂ©thode des nuÃƒÂ©es dynamiques), une premiÃƒÂ¨re version des futurs rÃƒÂ©seaux de neurones qui se nomme le Perceptron, et quelques algorithmes auto-ÃƒÂ©volutifs qui se nommeront plus tard gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©tiques. Dans les annÃƒÂ©es 1960 arrivent les arbres de dÃƒÂ©cision et la mÃƒÂ©thode des centres mobiles; ces techniques permettent aux chercheurs d'exploiter et de dÃƒÂ©couvrir des modÃƒÂ¨les de plus en plus prÃƒÂ©cis. En France, Jean-Paul BenzÃƒÂ©cri dÃƒÂ©veloppe l'analyse des correspondances en 1962. On reste cependant dans une optique de traitement par lots., 3418=L'expression Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â data miningÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» avait une connotation pÃƒÂ©jorative au dÃƒÂ©but des annÃƒÂ©es 1960, exprimant le mÃƒÂ©pris des statisticiens pour les dÃƒÂ©marches de recherche de corrÃƒÂ©lation sans hypothÃƒÂ¨ses de dÃƒÂ©part[rÃƒÂ©f.Ã‚Â nÃƒÂ©cessaire]. Elle tombe dans l'oubli, puis Rakesh Agrawal l'emploie ÃƒÂ  nouveau dans les annÃƒÂ©es 1980 lorsqu'il entamait ses recherches sur des bases de donnÃƒÂ©es d'un volume de 1Ã‚Â Mo. Le concept d'exploration de donnÃƒÂ©es fait son apparition, d'aprÃƒÂ¨s Pal et Jain, aux confÃƒÂ©rences de l'IJCAI en 1989[5]. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro chercha un nom pour ce nouveau concept dans la fin des annÃƒÂ©es 1980, aux GTE Laboratories. Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Data miningÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» ÃƒÂ©tant sous la protection d'un copyright, il employa l'expression Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Knowledge discovery in data basesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» (KDD)[6]., 1204=Puis, dans les annÃƒÂ©es 1990, viennent les techniques d'apprentissage automatique telles que les SVM[b 1] en 1998, qui complÃƒÂ¨tent les outils de l'analyste., 7203=En 1969 paraÃƒÂ®t l'ouvrage de Myron Tribus Rational descriptions, decisions and designs[4] qui gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralise les mÃƒÂ©thodes bayÃƒÂ©siennes dans le cadre du calcul automatique (professeur ÃƒÂ  Dartmouth, il utilise assez logiquement le langage BASIC, qui y a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ© quelques annÃƒÂ©es plus tÃƒÂ´t, et son interactivitÃƒÂ©). La traduction en franÃƒÂ§ais devient disponible en 1973 sous le nom DÃƒÂ©cisions rationnelles dans l'incertain. Une idÃƒÂ©e importante de l'ouvrage est la mention du thÃƒÂ©orÃƒÂ¨me de Cox-Jaynes dÃƒÂ©montrant que toute acquisition d'un modÃƒÂ¨le soit se fait selon les rÃƒÂ¨gles de Bayes (ÃƒÂ  un homomorphisme prÃƒÂ¨s), soit conduit ÃƒÂ  des incohÃƒÂ©rences. Une autre est que parmi toutes les distributions de probabilitÃƒÂ© satisfaisant aux observations (leur nombre est infini), il faut choisir celle qui contient le moins d'arbitraire (donc le moins d'information ajoutÃƒÂ©e, et en consÃƒÂ©quence celle d'entropie maximale[notes 3]. La probabilitÃƒÂ© s'y voit considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme simple traduction numÃƒÂ©rique d'un ÃƒÂ©tat de connaissance, sans connotation frÃƒÂ©quentiste sous-jacente. Enfin, cet ouvrage popularise la notation des probabilitÃƒÂ©s en dÃƒÂ©cibels, qui rend la rÃƒÂ¨gle de Bayes additive et permet de quantifier de faÃƒÂ§on unique l'apport d'une observation en la rendant dÃƒÂ©sormais indÃƒÂ©pendante des diverses estimations a priori prÃƒÂ©alables (voir InfÃƒÂ©rence bayÃƒÂ©sienne)., 12856=La gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ration de modÃƒÂ¨les ÃƒÂ  partir d'un grand nombre de donnÃƒÂ©es n'est pas un phÃƒÂ©nomÃƒÂ¨ne rÃƒÂ©cent. Pour qu'il y ait crÃƒÂ©ation de modÃƒÂ¨le il faut qu'il y ait collecte de donnÃƒÂ©es. En Chine on prÃƒÂªte ÃƒÂ  l'Empereur Tang Yao, la volontÃƒÂ© de recenser les rÃƒÂ©coltes en 2238 av. J.-C.[3]Ã‚Â ; en ÃƒÂ‰gypte le pharaon Amasis organise le recensement de sa population au cinquiÃƒÂ¨me siÃƒÂ¨cle av. J.-C.[3]. Ce n'est qu'au XVIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle qu'on commence ÃƒÂ  vouloir analyser les donnÃƒÂ©es pour en rechercher des caractÃƒÂ©ristiques communes. En 1662, John Graunt publie son livre Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of MortalityÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» dans lequel il analyse la mortalitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Londres et essaie de prÃƒÂ©voir les apparitions de la peste bubonique. En 1763, Thomas Bayes montre qu'on peut dÃƒÂ©terminer, non seulement des probabilitÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  partir des observations issues dÃ¢Â€Â™une expÃƒÂ©rience, mais aussi les paramÃƒÂ¨tres relatifs ÃƒÂ  ces probabilitÃƒÂ©s. PrÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© dans le cas particulier d'une loi binomiale, ce rÃƒÂ©sultat est ÃƒÂ©tendu indÃƒÂ©pendamment par Laplace, conduisant ÃƒÂ  une formulation gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale du thÃƒÂ©orÃƒÂ¨me de Bayes. Legendre publie en 1805 un essai sur la mÃƒÂ©thode des moindres carrÃƒÂ©s qui permet de comparer un ensemble de donnÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ  un modÃƒÂ¨le mathÃƒÂ©matique. Les calculs manuels coÃƒÂ»teux ne permettent cependant pas d'utiliser ces mÃƒÂ©thodes hors d'un petit nombre de cas simples et ÃƒÂ©clairants.}"

En 2004, comme sur lÃ¢Â€Â™ensemble du territoire, les ÃƒÂ©lections furent favorables ÃƒÂ  la gauche avec des victoires du candidat socialiste sur le tiers de la commune concernÃƒÂ©e par les ÃƒÂ©lections cantonales, et la nette avance des candidats socialistes aux ÃƒÂ©lections rÃƒÂ©gionales et europÃƒÂ©ennes. En 2006, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©lection cantonale partielle vit cependant une nouvelle victoire de la droite, confirmÃƒÂ©e par les scores importants, bien quÃ¢Â€Â™en baisse, des candidats de la majoritÃƒÂ© prÃƒÂ©sidentielle. En 2008, bien quÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©lu une nouvelle fois au premier tour, le maire sortant voyait une importante ÃƒÂ©rosion de son ÃƒÂ©lectorat, dans les mÃƒÂªmes proportions que pour les ÃƒÂ©lections cantonales oÃƒÂ¹ la droite peina ÃƒÂ  dÃƒÂ©passer les 50Ã‚Â % des suffrages. LÃ¢Â€Â™annÃƒÂ©e 2009 vit comme partout dans la rÃƒÂ©gion la nette avance du mouvement populaire et la percÃƒÂ©e du mouvement Europe ÃƒÂ‰cologie, toutefois onze points derriÃƒÂ¨re. En 2005, les ÃƒÂ©lecteurs Saviniens ont rejetÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  50,11Ã‚Â % le traitÃƒÂ© de Lisbonne alors quÃ¢Â€Â™ils avaient approuvÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  54,17Ã‚Â % le traitÃƒÂ© de Maastricht[78]. La fÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration dÃƒÂ©partementale de lÃ¢Â€Â™Union pour un mouvement populaire est implantÃƒÂ©e dans la commune[79], ainsi que des sections du Parti socialiste[80] et du Parti communiste franÃƒÂ§ais[81]., 137211=En 2009, la commune disposait dÃ¢Â€Â™un budget de 49Ã‚Â 187Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬ dont 41Ã‚Â 204Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬ de fonctionnement et 7Ã‚Â 983Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬ dÃ¢Â€Â™investissement[59], financÃƒÂ©s pour 43,50Ã‚Â % par les impÃƒÂ´ts locaux[60] avec des taux de taxes fixÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  16,92Ã‚Â % pour la taxe d'habitation, 14,92Ã‚Â % et 50Ã‚Â % pour la taxe fonciÃƒÂ¨re sur le bÃƒÂ¢ti et le non-bÃƒÂ¢ti et 20,97Ã‚Â % pour la taxe professionnelle[61], la mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e, la dette municipale sÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©levait ÃƒÂ  32Ã‚Â 219Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬[62]. En 2009, sur les 15Ã‚Â 964 logements que comptait la commune, 2Ã‚Â 066 ÃƒÂ©taient des logements sociaux[63] soit seulement 12,94Ã‚Â % du parc, la commune ne respectant ainsi pas le seuil de 20Ã‚Â % imposÃƒÂ© par la loi relative ÃƒÂ  la solidaritÃƒÂ© et au renouvellement urbains., 98300=En 1942, la mairie fut transfÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e dans une ancienne ferme, plus vaste. Durant la seconde Guerre mondiale, les rÃƒÂ©sistants Georgette et Francis Remoissenet et Fernande et Paul Arnoult sÃ¢Â€Â™illustrÃƒÂ¨rent par lÃ¢Â€Â™aide quÃ¢Â€Â™ils apportÃƒÂ¨rent aux persÃƒÂ©cutÃƒÂ©s, ils ont ainsi ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s au rang de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Juste parmi les nationsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[41],[42]. Entre 1945 et 1972, la ferme de Champagne, devenue propriÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© du ministÃƒÂ¨re de la Justice servit de centre dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©ducation surveillÃƒÂ©e pour mineurs dÃƒÂ©linquants. En 1947, le ministÃƒÂ¨re de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ‰ducation nationale, propriÃƒÂ©taire du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny y installa une annexe du lycÃƒÂ©e Lakanal de Sceaux. En 1953, cette annexe devint le lycÃƒÂ©e autonome Jean-Baptiste Corot[43]. Les Trente Glorieuses entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ¨rent un nouvel afflux de population, rapidement logÃƒÂ©e dans les grands ensembles implantÃƒÂ©s dans le parc du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux entre 1960 et 1966, ÃƒÂ  Clair Village entre 1967 et 1971 et aux PrÃƒÂ©s-Saint-Martin entre 1970 et 1972[44]. Les groupes scolaires Kennedy et Saint-ExupÃƒÂ©ry et lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Notre-Dame-de-lÃ¢Â€Â™EspÃƒÂ©rance accompagnÃƒÂ¨rent cette urbanisation entre 1962 et 1964. Entre 1953 et 1960, le parc de Grand Vaux fut coupÃƒÂ© en deux par la nouvelle autoroute A6 qui reliait ainsi directement la commune aux portes de Paris. Le 24 mai 1969, Savigny-sur-Orge accueillit un meeting de campagne du candidat Georges Pompidou[45]. Entre 1978 et 1979, Savigny-sur-Orge fut ÃƒÂ  nouveau sous le feu des projecteurs lors de lÃ¢Â€Â™affaire Empain[46]., 90473=Au XIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle fut ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e sur le plateau la ferme de Champagne. LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Saint-Martin fut ÃƒÂ©difiÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  cette ÃƒÂ©poque par les moines de lÃ¢Â€Â™abbaye de Longpont. Pendant la guerre de Cent Ans, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise comme beaucoup dÃ¢Â€Â™autres de la rÃƒÂ©gion fut ravagÃƒÂ©e puis reconstruite. En 1475, ÃƒÂ‰tienne de Vesc, chambellan de Charles VIII, acquit le domaine de Savigny. Entre 1485 et 1488, il ÃƒÂ©tendit le domaine sur la Champagne et le bois de Viry. En 1493, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise agrandie fut consacrÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. En 1587 furent installÃƒÂ©es quatre cloches ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. Charles-FranÃƒÂ§ois de Vintimille du Luc hÃƒÂ©rita de la seigneurie et mourut au chÃƒÂ¢teau en 1740. Au XVIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, Marie-Nicolas Pigeon, avocat au Parlement de Paris fit construire le domaine de Courte-rente. Entre 1635 et 1797, le domaine de Grand Vaux passa entre diffÃƒÂ©rentes mains. Pierre Vigier lÃ¢Â€Â™acquit en 1797 et lÃ¢Â€Â™agrandit jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  sa mort en 1817, le parc couvrant alors cent hectares., 163034=Le 29 septembre 2008, ÃƒÂ  la suite du dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ¨s de son prÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©cesseur Jean Marsaudon, Laurence Spicher-Bernier a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©lue maire. NÃƒÂ©e le 16 juin 1961 dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris, ses parents se sont installÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge en 1964 dans le quartier populaire de Grand-Vaux. EmployÃƒÂ©e de banque pendant dix-sept ans, elle est ensuite agent immobilier. PrÃƒÂ©sidente de lÃ¢Â€Â™association des commerÃƒÂ§ants de Savigny-sur-Orge pendant quinze ans, elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© pendant dix ans Conseiller prudÃ¢Â€Â™hommes[73],[74]. Le 6 septembre 2011, Laurence Spicher-Bernier est condamnÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  huit mois de prison avec sursis par le tribunal correctionnel d'Evry pour exercice illÃƒÂ©gal de la profession dÃ¢Â€Â™avocat et usage illicite du titre de conseil[75]. Membre du Parti radical[76], elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© exclue en mars 2012 de l'UMP pour avoir prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© une candidature dissidente aux ÃƒÂ©lections lÃƒÂ©gislatives[77]. En 2014, ÃƒÂ  l'issue d'un second tour marquÃƒÂ© par une quadrangulaire, Eric Mehlhorn devient Maire de Savigny-sur-Orge., 268829=Savigny-sur-Orge sÃ¢Â€Â™est dotÃƒÂ©e en 1990 dÃ¢Â€Â™un logotype, il fut modernisÃƒÂ© en 2004. Il ÃƒÂ©tait voulu plus dynamique avec la prÃƒÂ©sence de rouge et d'un Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â SÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» stylisÃƒÂ© et symbolisant la croissance de la commune en s'ÃƒÂ©tirant vers le haut[156]., 215596=Le sport ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge se pratique en divers lieux rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire. La commune dispose ainsi du parc des sports Jean Moulin complÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© par la maison du tennis et lÃ¢Â€Â™espace Jean Laguionie, des complexes sportifs David Douillet, Pierre de Coubertin et LÃƒÂ©on Cheymol, du gymnase John Fitzgerald Kennedy, de la salle polyvalente Aristide Briand, du boulodrome Pierre Mathieu et de la salle dÃ¢Â€Â™haltÃƒÂ©rophilie Mamadou Lamine Loum[131]. La commune a mis en place des ÃƒÂ©coles municipales du sport et du cirque. Elle organise depuis 1990 les Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â FoulÃƒÂ©es de SavignyÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» une course dÃ¢Â€Â™endurance de la marche au semi-marathon. La commune accueille en rÃƒÂ©sidence lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe des Lions de Savigny-sur-Orge, club de baseball fondÃƒÂ© en 1982 qui ÃƒÂ©volue en championnat de France. S'ajoutent diverses disciplines regroupÃƒÂ©es au sein du club olympique Savigny (handball, basket-ball et football)., 108367=En 2012, la commune comptait 37Ã‚Â 135Ã‚Â habitants. L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 104920=AujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui quatriÃƒÂ¨me commune du dÃƒÂ©partement en nombre dÃ¢Â€Â™habitants, Savigny-sur-Orge a connu comme de nombreuses villes de lÃ¢Â€Â™agglomÃƒÂ©ration parisienne une explosion urbanistique et dÃƒÂ©mographique au cours du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, entamÃƒÂ©e dÃƒÂ¨s les annÃƒÂ©es 1920. Lors du premier recensement des personnes en 1793, la nouvelle commune nÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait quÃ¢Â€Â™un village de mille cinq habitants, qui connut par la suite une forte baisse puis une ÃƒÂ©volution chaotique, jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  ne compter que huit cent vingt-trois rÃƒÂ©sidents en 1800. Elle ne dÃƒÂ©passa ÃƒÂ  nouveau le cap des mille personnes que lors du recensement de 1856, date ÃƒÂ  partir de laquelle la croissance se poursuivit de faÃƒÂ§on relativement linÃƒÂ©aire et lente, pour nÃ¢Â€Â™approcher le nombre de deux mille rÃƒÂ©sidents quÃ¢Â€Â™en 1921. En 1926 dÃƒÂ©buta une pÃƒÂ©riode de dÃƒÂ©veloppement plus rapide avec dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  prÃƒÂ¨s de cinq mille six cent habitants et trÃƒÂ¨s vite plus de onze mille dÃƒÂ¨s 1931. Le second conflit mondial eut un impact limitÃƒÂ© sur cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1946 la population ÃƒÂ©tait passÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  quatorze mille cinq cent cinquante quatre personnes puis plus de dix sept mille en 1954, vingt-quatre mille en 1962 et prÃƒÂ¨s de trente quatre mille cinq cent en 1975. Le recensement de 1982 fut marquÃƒÂ© par une nette diminution avec la perte de deux mille habitants avant une reprise de la croissance jusquÃ¢Â€Â™au chiffre ÃƒÂ©tablit en 2006 ÃƒÂ  trente sept mille deux cent cinquante neuf Saviniens. LÃ¢Â€Â™immigration compte pour une part relativement importante dans cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1999, 8,2Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©trangÃƒÂ¨re[48]. Parmi cette population, 3,2Ã‚Â % ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© Portugaise, 0,9Ã‚Â % Marocaine, 0,8Ã‚Â % AlgÃƒÂ©rienne, 0,5Ã‚Â % Italienne, 0,3Ã‚Â % Espagnole et Tunisienne et 0,2Ã‚Â % Turque[49]., 231625=La dÃƒÂ©mographie ÃƒÂ©conomique de la commune se distingue assez fortement des moyennes nationales et de la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi. On trouve ainsi ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge une proportion presque double dÃ¢Â€Â™artisans et commerÃƒÂ§ants que dans la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi, plus dÃ¢Â€Â™employÃƒÂ©s et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse nettement moins dÃ¢Â€Â™ouvriers. Les secteurs dÃ¢Â€Â™activitÃƒÂ©s oÃƒÂ¹ exerce la population est elle aussi relativement diffÃƒÂ©rente avec une rÃƒÂ©partition plus importante dans la construction et les services aux particuliers ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge que dans le reste du bassin et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse un net dÃƒÂ©ficit dans lÃ¢Â€Â™industrie, les services aux entreprises, dÃƒÂ» principalement au fait quÃ¢Â€Â™aucune entreprise dÃ¢Â€Â™envergure dans ces secteurs nÃ¢Â€Â™est implantÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  proximitÃƒÂ©. Parmi la population ayant un emploi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 80Ã‚Â % disposait dÃ¢Â€Â™un statut de titulaire de la fonction publique ou dÃ¢Â€Â™un contrat ÃƒÂ  durÃƒÂ©e indÃƒÂ©terminÃƒÂ©e. Le revenu net imposable moyen ÃƒÂ©tait fixÃƒÂ© en 2006 ÃƒÂ  26Ã‚Â 290 euros mais 31Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages ne payaient pas dÃ¢Â€Â™impÃƒÂ´t sur le revenu. PrÃƒÂ¨s de 66Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait propriÃƒÂ©taire de son logement, un pavillon dans 55Ã‚Â % des cas[138]. Le revenu fiscal mÃƒÂ©dian par mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ©tait en 2006 de 21Ã‚Â 651 euros, ce qui plaÃƒÂ§ait Savigny-sur-Orge au mille six cent sixiÃƒÂ¨me rang parmi les 30Ã‚Â 687 communes de plus de cinquante mÃƒÂ©nages en mÃƒÂ©tropole et au cent vingt-neuviÃƒÂ¨me rang dÃƒÂ©partemental[139]., 93024=En 1801, Pauline de Beaumont loua le domaine de Courte-rente pour abriter ses amours avec FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand. En 1802, Louis Nicolas Davout acquit le chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny et y fit dÃ¢Â€Â™importants travaux. En 1854, Charles Petit, propriÃƒÂ©taire de la ferme de Champagne crÃƒÂ©a une usine dÃ¢Â€Â™expÃƒÂ©rimentation de distillation de la betterave sucriÃƒÂ¨re. En 1855, Louis Adolf Duval, futur maire de la commune fonde une manufacture de fleurs artificielles. En 1869, la reine dÃ¢Â€Â™Espagne Isabelle II en exil sÃƒÂ©journa au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny., 228206=La commune de Savigny-sur-Orge est principalement occupÃƒÂ©e par des espaces dÃ¢Â€Â™habitation, elle se rapproche ainsi du concept de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â banlieue dortoirÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». Le commerce joue un rÃƒÂ´le important dans la vie ÃƒÂ©conomique avec un centre-ville actif et deux marchÃƒÂ©s organisÃƒÂ©s, le marchÃƒÂ© Jules Ferry qui se tient les jeudis et samedis et le marchÃƒÂ© Davout qui a lieu chaque mardi, vendredi et dimanche[135]. La commune accueillait en 2006 1Ã‚Â 297 entreprises dont 739 dans le seul secteur des services. Elle ne dispose cependant que dÃ¢Â€Â™une petite zone d'activitÃƒÂ©s industrielles et commerciales au nord-ouest, implantÃƒÂ©e en bordure de lÃ¢Â€Â™autoroute A6. Dans cette zone se regroupent principalement des entreprises de services employant relativement peu de salariÃƒÂ©s. Ainsi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 85Ã‚Â % des actifs de la commune ÃƒÂ©taient contraint de se rentre dans une autre commune ou un autre dÃƒÂ©partement pour exercer leur activitÃƒÂ©. Plusieurs supermarchÃƒÂ©s sont rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire, complÃƒÂ©tant lÃ¢Â€Â™offre de commerces de proximitÃƒÂ© dense. Trois hÃƒÂ´tels regroupent un total de cent cinquante-deux chambres[136].

Dans cette zone, la population active comptait 232Ã‚Â 993 personnes mais seulement 210Ã‚Â 476 personnes avaient un emploi. Dans la commune, la population active comptait 18Ã‚Â 556 personnes et 16Ã‚Â 859 avaient un emploi., 139410=La commune adhÃƒÂ©ra en 2013 ÃƒÂ  la communautÃƒÂ© d'agglomÃƒÂ©ration Les Portes de l'Essonne[64] et coopÃƒÂ©rait avec les communes voisines dans le cadre du syndicat mixte Orge-Yvette-Seine, du syndicat mixte pour la revalorisation et l'ÃƒÂ©limination des dÃƒÂ©chets et ordures mÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ¨res[65] et du syndicat mixte d'amÃƒÂ©nagement hydraulique de la VallÃƒÂ©e de l'Yvette[66]. La commune sÃ¢Â€Â™est dotÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢Â€Â™un office de tourisme., 268513=Le blason crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ© en 1952 par un Savinien est inspirÃƒÂ© de celui du marÃƒÂ©chal Davout. Le semis de fleurs de lys rappelle que Savigny est situÃƒÂ© dans lÃ¢Â€Â™ancienne province dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂŽle-de-France dont la fleur de lys ÃƒÂ©tait lÃ¢Â€Â™emblÃƒÂ¨me., 118821=LÃ¢Â€Â™analyse comparÃƒÂ©e des pyramides des ÃƒÂ¢ges de Savigny-sur-Orge et du dÃƒÂ©partement de lÃ¢Â€Â™Essonne ÃƒÂ©tablies en 2006 montre une relative similaritÃƒÂ© de rÃƒÂ©partition des catÃƒÂ©gories dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ges dans la population, avec nÃƒÂ©anmoins quelques variations, ÃƒÂ  la baisse dans la commune pour les jeunes rÃƒÂ©sidents et ÃƒÂ  la hausse pour les populations masculines entre trente et soixante-quatorze ans. ÃƒÂ€ lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse, dans la commune, les femmes sont moins reprÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©es que dans le reste du dÃƒÂ©partement jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ge de cinquante-neuf ans puis largement plus nombreuses pour les trois tranches dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ges suivantes. En 1999, la proportion de jeunes de moins de vingt-cinq ans reprÃƒÂ©sentait 30,5Ã‚Â % dans la commune et les familles monoparentales comptaient pour 11,0Ã‚Â % de la population[52]., 102740=LÃ¢Â€Â™urbanisation sÃ¢Â€Â™acheva en 1992 avec lÃ¢Â€Â™amÃƒÂ©nagement de la zone d'amÃƒÂ©nagement concertÃƒÂ© des GÃƒÂ¢tines[47]. En 1999, la commune se dota dÃ¢Â€Â™un nouvel hÃƒÂ´tel de ville. Savigny-sur-Orge fut la premiÃƒÂ¨re ville ÃƒÂ  avoir pris la dÃƒÂ©cision dÃ¢Â€Â™un couvre-feu de vingt-deux heure ÃƒÂ  sept heures du matin pour les mineurs, lors des ÃƒÂ©meutes de novembre 2005., 95847=En 1916, la ferme de Champagne fut vendue et accueillie un centre de rÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©ducation des victimes de guerre inaugurÃƒÂ© en 1917 par le prÃƒÂ©sident de la RÃƒÂ©publique Raymond PoincarÃƒÂ©[40]. La mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e, des hÃƒÂ´pitaux militaires furent installÃƒÂ©s au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux et au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny., 195963=Les ÃƒÂ©coles Aristide Briand, Champagne, FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand, Jules Ferry, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Louise Michel, des Marguerites, Jean Mermoz, Paul Bert et Antoine de Saint-ExupÃƒÂ©ry servent en dehors des pÃƒÂ©riodes scolaires de centres de loisirs.

Un centre d'information et d'orientation est implantÃƒÂ© dans la commune[109]., 96675=Au sortir de la PremiÃƒÂ¨re Guerre mondiale, lÃ¢Â€Â™afflux de provinciaux dans la rÃƒÂ©gion capitale et la politique en faveur du logement social modifiÃƒÂ¨rent la physionomie de la commune. Entre 1923 et 1935, des lotissements pavillonnaires remplace les champs et vergers au nord et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™est du centre-ville, dÃ¢Â€Â™abord pour la villÃƒÂ©giature des parisiens puis pour le logement des nouveaux employÃƒÂ©s et ouvriers. Outre la construction dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipements publics, la viabilisation des nouveaux quartiers fut entreprise ÃƒÂ  partir de 1928 et des 1931, prÃƒÂ¨s de 70Ã‚Â % des Saviniens rÃƒÂ©sidaient sur le plateau. En 1929, pour accompagner cette croissance dÃƒÂ©mographique fut construit le groupe scolaire Jules Ferry, suivit en 1931 par lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Sainte-ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se et en 1936 par le groupe Aristide Briand.

LÃ¢Â€Â™analyse des rÃƒÂ©sultats des ÃƒÂ©lections organisÃƒÂ©es au cours de la derniÃƒÂ¨re dÃƒÂ©cennie montre ainsi une nette avance des candidats de la droite gouvernementale avec en 2001 des scores important pour le maire sortant Jean Marsaudon et la conseillÃƒÂ¨re gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale avec respectivement 52,17Ã‚Â % et 58,55Ã‚Â % des suffrages. En 2002, le candidat Jacques Chirac y obtint prÃƒÂ¨s de 85Ã‚Â % des bulletins de vote soit deux points de plus quÃ¢Â€Â™au niveau national et les ÃƒÂ©lecteurs avaient ÃƒÂ©cartÃƒÂ© le candidat frontiste dÃƒÂ¨s le premier tour au profit de Lionel Jospin. La mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e, le dÃƒÂ©putÃƒÂ© maire sortant obtenait une large victoire face ÃƒÂ  son adversaire socialiste. En 2004, comme sur lÃ¢Â€Â™ensemble du territoire, les ÃƒÂ©lections furent favorables ÃƒÂ  la gauche avec des victoires du candidat socialiste sur le tiers de la commune concernÃƒÂ©e par les ÃƒÂ©lections cantonales, et la nette avance des candidats socialistes aux ÃƒÂ©lections rÃƒÂ©gionales et europÃƒÂ©ennes.

Durant la seconde Guerre mondiale, les rÃƒÂ©sistants Georgette et Francis Remoissenet et Fernande et Paul Arnoult sÃ¢Â€Â™illustrÃƒÂ¨rent par lÃ¢Â€Â™aide quÃ¢Â€Â™ils apportÃƒÂ¨rent aux persÃƒÂ©cutÃƒÂ©s, ils ont ainsi ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s au rang de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Juste parmi les nationsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[41],[42]. Entre 1945 et 1972, la ferme de Champagne, devenue propriÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© du ministÃƒÂ¨re de la Justice servit de centre dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©ducation surveillÃƒÂ©e pour mineurs dÃƒÂ©linquants. En 1947, le ministÃƒÂ¨re de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ‰ducation nationale, propriÃƒÂ©taire du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny y installa une annexe du lycÃƒÂ©e Lakanal de Sceaux. En 1953, cette annexe devint le lycÃƒÂ©e autonome Jean-Baptiste Corot[43]. Les Trente Glorieuses entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ¨rent un nouvel afflux de population, rapidement logÃƒÂ©e dans les grands ensembles implantÃƒÂ©s dans le parc du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux entre 1960 et 1966, ÃƒÂ  Clair Village entre 1967 et 1971 et aux PrÃƒÂ©s-Saint-Martin entre 1970 et 1972[44]. Les groupes scolaires Kennedy et Saint-ExupÃƒÂ©ry et lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Notre-Dame-de-lÃ¢Â€Â™EspÃƒÂ©rance accompagnÃƒÂ¨rent cette urbanisation entre 1962 et 1964. Entre 1953 et 1960, le parc de Grand Vaux fut coupÃƒÂ© en deux par la nouvelle autoroute A6 qui reliait ainsi directement la commune aux portes de Paris. Le 24 mai 1969, Savigny-sur-Orge accueillit un meeting de campagne du candidat Georges Pompidou[45]. Entre 1978 et 1979, Savigny-sur-Orge fut ÃƒÂ  nouveau sous le feu des projecteurs lors de lÃ¢Â€Â™affaire Empain[46]., 90473=Au XIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle fut ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e sur le plateau la ferme de Champagne. LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Saint-Martin fut ÃƒÂ©difiÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  cette ÃƒÂ©poque par les moines de lÃ¢Â€Â™abbaye de Longpont. Pendant la guerre de Cent Ans, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise comme beaucoup dÃ¢Â€Â™autres de la rÃƒÂ©gion fut ravagÃƒÂ©e puis reconstruite. En 1475, ÃƒÂ‰tienne de Vesc, chambellan de Charles VIII, acquit le domaine de Savigny. Entre 1485 et 1488, il ÃƒÂ©tendit le domaine sur la Champagne et le bois de Viry. En 1493, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise agrandie fut consacrÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. En 1587 furent installÃƒÂ©es quatre cloches ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. Charles-FranÃƒÂ§ois de Vintimille du Luc hÃƒÂ©rita de la seigneurie et mourut au chÃƒÂ¢teau en 1740. Au XVIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, Marie-Nicolas Pigeon, avocat au Parlement de Paris fit construire le domaine de Courte-rente. Entre 1635 et 1797, le domaine de Grand Vaux passa entre diffÃƒÂ©rentes mains. Pierre Vigier lÃ¢Â€Â™acquit en 1797 et lÃ¢Â€Â™agrandit jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  sa mort en 1817, le parc couvrant alors cent hectares., 163034=Le 29 septembre 2008, ÃƒÂ  la suite du dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ¨s de son prÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©cesseur Jean Marsaudon, Laurence Spicher-Bernier a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©lue maire. NÃƒÂ©e le 16 juin 1961 dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris, ses parents se sont installÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge en 1964 dans le quartier populaire de Grand-Vaux. EmployÃƒÂ©e de banque pendant dix-sept ans, elle est ensuite agent immobilier. PrÃƒÂ©sidente de lÃ¢Â€Â™association des commerÃƒÂ§ants de Savigny-sur-Orge pendant quinze ans, elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© pendant dix ans Conseiller prudÃ¢Â€Â™hommes[73],[74].

Membre du Parti radical[76], elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© exclue en mars 2012 de l'UMP pour avoir prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© une candidature dissidente aux ÃƒÂ©lections lÃƒÂ©gislatives[77]. En 2014, ÃƒÂ  l'issue d'un second tour marquÃƒÂ© par une quadrangulaire, Eric Mehlhorn devient Maire de Savigny-sur-Orge., 268829=Savigny-sur-Orge sÃ¢Â€Â™est dotÃƒÂ©e en 1990 dÃ¢Â€Â™un logotype, il fut modernisÃƒÂ© en 2004.

La commune dispose ainsi du parc des sports Jean Moulin complÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© par la maison du tennis et lÃ¢Â€Â™espace Jean Laguionie, des complexes sportifs David Douillet, Pierre de Coubertin et LÃƒÂ©on Cheymol, du gymnase John Fitzgerald Kennedy, de la salle polyvalente Aristide Briand, du boulodrome Pierre Mathieu et de la salle dÃ¢Â€Â™haltÃƒÂ©rophilie Mamadou Lamine Loum[131]. La commune a mis en place des ÃƒÂ©coles municipales du sport et du cirque. Elle organise depuis 1990 les Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â FoulÃƒÂ©es de SavignyÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» une course dÃ¢Â€Â™endurance de la marche au semi-marathon. La commune accueille en rÃƒÂ©sidence lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe des Lions de Savigny-sur-Orge, club de baseball fondÃƒÂ© en 1982 qui ÃƒÂ©volue en championnat de France. S'ajoutent diverses disciplines regroupÃƒÂ©es au sein du club olympique Savigny (handball, basket-ball et football)., 108367=En 2012, la commune comptait 37Ã‚Â 135Ã‚Â habitants. L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 104920=AujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui quatriÃƒÂ¨me commune du dÃƒÂ©partement en nombre dÃ¢Â€Â™habitants, Savigny-sur-Orge a connu comme de nombreuses villes de lÃ¢Â€Â™agglomÃƒÂ©ration parisienne une explosion urbanistique et dÃƒÂ©mographique au cours du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, entamÃƒÂ©e dÃƒÂ¨s les annÃƒÂ©es 1920. Lors du premier recensement des personnes en 1793, la nouvelle commune nÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait quÃ¢Â€Â™un village de mille cinq habitants, qui connut par la suite une forte baisse puis une ÃƒÂ©volution chaotique, jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  ne compter que huit cent vingt-trois rÃƒÂ©sidents en 1800. Elle ne dÃƒÂ©passa ÃƒÂ  nouveau le cap des mille personnes que lors du recensement de 1856, date ÃƒÂ  partir de laquelle la croissance se poursuivit de faÃƒÂ§on relativement linÃƒÂ©aire et lente, pour nÃ¢Â€Â™approcher le nombre de deux mille rÃƒÂ©sidents quÃ¢Â€Â™en 1921. En 1926 dÃƒÂ©buta une pÃƒÂ©riode de dÃƒÂ©veloppement plus rapide avec dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  prÃƒÂ¨s de cinq mille six cent habitants et trÃƒÂ¨s vite plus de onze mille dÃƒÂ¨s 1931. Le second conflit mondial eut un impact limitÃƒÂ© sur cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1946 la population ÃƒÂ©tait passÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  quatorze mille cinq cent cinquante quatre personnes puis plus de dix sept mille en 1954, vingt-quatre mille en 1962 et prÃƒÂ¨s de trente quatre mille cinq cent en 1975. Le recensement de 1982 fut marquÃƒÂ© par une nette diminution avec la perte de deux mille habitants avant une reprise de la croissance jusquÃ¢Â€Â™au chiffre ÃƒÂ©tablit en 2006 ÃƒÂ  trente sept mille deux cent cinquante neuf Saviniens. LÃ¢Â€Â™immigration compte pour une part relativement importante dans cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1999, 8,2Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©trangÃƒÂ¨re[48]. Parmi cette population, 3,2Ã‚Â % ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© Portugaise, 0,9Ã‚Â % Marocaine, 0,8Ã‚Â % AlgÃƒÂ©rienne, 0,5Ã‚Â % Italienne, 0,3Ã‚Â % Espagnole et Tunisienne et 0,2Ã‚Â % Turque[49]., 231625=La dÃƒÂ©mographie ÃƒÂ©conomique de la commune se distingue assez fortement des moyennes nationales et de la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi. On trouve ainsi ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge une proportion presque double dÃ¢Â€Â™artisans et commerÃƒÂ§ants que dans la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi, plus dÃ¢Â€Â™employÃƒÂ©s et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse nettement moins dÃ¢Â€Â™ouvriers.

Parmi la population ayant un emploi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 80Ã‚Â % disposait dÃ¢Â€Â™un statut de titulaire de la fonction publique ou dÃ¢Â€Â™un contrat ÃƒÂ  durÃƒÂ©e indÃƒÂ©terminÃƒÂ©e. Le revenu net imposable moyen ÃƒÂ©tait fixÃƒÂ© en 2006 ÃƒÂ  26Ã‚Â 290 euros mais 31Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages ne payaient pas dÃ¢Â€Â™impÃƒÂ´t sur le revenu. PrÃƒÂ¨s de 66Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait propriÃƒÂ©taire de son logement, un pavillon dans 55Ã‚Â % des cas[138]. Le revenu fiscal mÃƒÂ©dian par mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ©tait en 2006 de 21Ã‚Â 651 euros, ce qui plaÃƒÂ§ait Savigny-sur-Orge au mille six cent sixiÃƒÂ¨me rang parmi les 30Ã‚Â 687 communes de plus de cinquante mÃƒÂ©nages en mÃƒÂ©tropole et au cent vingt-neuviÃƒÂ¨me rang dÃƒÂ©partemental[139]., 93024=En 1801, Pauline de Beaumont loua le domaine de Courte-rente pour abriter ses amours avec FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand. En 1802, Louis Nicolas Davout acquit le chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny et y fit dÃ¢Â€Â™importants travaux. En 1854, Charles Petit, propriÃƒÂ©taire de la ferme de Champagne crÃƒÂ©a une usine dÃ¢Â€Â™expÃƒÂ©rimentation de distillation de la betterave sucriÃƒÂ¨re.

La commune accueillait en 2006 1Ã‚Â 297 entreprises dont 739 dans le seul secteur des services. Elle ne dispose cependant que dÃ¢Â€Â™une petite zone d'activitÃƒÂ©s industrielles et commerciales au nord-ouest, implantÃƒÂ©e en bordure de lÃ¢Â€Â™autoroute A6. Dans cette zone se regroupent principalement des entreprises de services employant relativement peu de salariÃƒÂ©s. Ainsi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 85Ã‚Â % des actifs de la commune ÃƒÂ©taient contraint de se rentre dans une autre commune ou un autre dÃƒÂ©partement pour exercer leur activitÃƒÂ©. Plusieurs supermarchÃƒÂ©s sont rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire, complÃƒÂ©tant lÃ¢Â€Â™offre de commerces de proximitÃƒÂ© dense. Trois hÃƒÂ´tels regroupent un total de cent cinquante-deux chambres[136].

LÃ¢Â€Â™analyse des rÃƒÂ©sultats des ÃƒÂ©lections organisÃƒÂ©es au cours de la derniÃƒÂ¨re dÃƒÂ©cennie montre ainsi une nette avance des candidats de la droite gouvernementale avec en 2001 des scores important pour le maire sortant Jean Marsaudon et la conseillÃƒÂ¨re gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale avec respectivement 52,17Ã‚Â % et 58,55Ã‚Â % des suffrages.

En 1947, le ministÃƒÂ¨re de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ‰ducation nationale, propriÃƒÂ©taire du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny y installa une annexe du lycÃƒÂ©e Lakanal de Sceaux. En 1953, cette annexe devint le lycÃƒÂ©e autonome Jean-Baptiste Corot[43]. Les Trente Glorieuses entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ¨rent un nouvel afflux de population, rapidement logÃƒÂ©e dans les grands ensembles implantÃƒÂ©s dans le parc du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux entre 1960 et 1966, ÃƒÂ  Clair Village entre 1967 et 1971 et aux PrÃƒÂ©s-Saint-Martin entre 1970 et 1972[44].

Entre 1953 et 1960, le parc de Grand Vaux fut coupÃƒÂ© en deux par la nouvelle autoroute A6 qui reliait ainsi directement la commune aux portes de Paris. Le 24 mai 1969, Savigny-sur-Orge accueillit un meeting de campagne du candidat Georges Pompidou[45].

LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Saint-Martin fut ÃƒÂ©difiÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  cette ÃƒÂ©poque par les moines de lÃ¢Â€Â™abbaye de Longpont. Pendant la guerre de Cent Ans, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise comme beaucoup dÃ¢Â€Â™autres de la rÃƒÂ©gion fut ravagÃƒÂ©e puis reconstruite. En 1475, ÃƒÂ‰tienne de Vesc, chambellan de Charles VIII, acquit le domaine de Savigny. Entre 1485 et 1488, il ÃƒÂ©tendit le domaine sur la Champagne et le bois de Viry. En 1493, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise agrandie fut consacrÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. En 1587 furent installÃƒÂ©es quatre cloches ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. Charles-FranÃƒÂ§ois de Vintimille du Luc hÃƒÂ©rita de la seigneurie et mourut au chÃƒÂ¢teau en 1740. Au XVIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, Marie-Nicolas Pigeon, avocat au Parlement de Paris fit construire le domaine de Courte-rente. Entre 1635 et 1797, le domaine de Grand Vaux passa entre diffÃƒÂ©rentes mains. Pierre Vigier lÃ¢Â€Â™acquit en 1797 et lÃ¢Â€Â™agrandit jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  sa mort en 1817, le parc couvrant alors cent hectares., 163034=Le 29 septembre 2008, ÃƒÂ  la suite du dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ¨s de son prÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©cesseur Jean Marsaudon, Laurence Spicher-Bernier a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©lue maire. NÃƒÂ©e le 16 juin 1961 dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris, ses parents se sont installÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge en 1964 dans le quartier populaire de Grand-Vaux.

L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 104920=AujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui quatriÃƒÂ¨me commune du dÃƒÂ©partement en nombre dÃ¢Â€Â™habitants, Savigny-sur-Orge a connu comme de nombreuses villes de lÃ¢Â€Â™agglomÃƒÂ©ration parisienne une explosion urbanistique et dÃƒÂ©mographique au cours du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, entamÃƒÂ©e dÃƒÂ¨s les annÃƒÂ©es 1920.

Le second conflit mondial eut un impact limitÃƒÂ© sur cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1946 la population ÃƒÂ©tait passÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  quatorze mille cinq cent cinquante quatre personnes puis plus de dix sept mille en 1954, vingt-quatre mille en 1962 et prÃƒÂ¨s de trente quatre mille cinq cent en 1975. Le recensement de 1982 fut marquÃƒÂ© par une nette diminution avec la perte de deux mille habitants avant une reprise de la croissance jusquÃ¢Â€Â™au chiffre ÃƒÂ©tablit en 2006 ÃƒÂ  trente sept mille deux cent cinquante neuf Saviniens. LÃ¢Â€Â™immigration compte pour une part relativement importante dans cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1999, 8,2Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©trangÃƒÂ¨re[48]. Parmi cette population, 3,2Ã‚Â % ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© Portugaise, 0,9Ã‚Â % Marocaine, 0,8Ã‚Â % AlgÃƒÂ©rienne, 0,5Ã‚Â % Italienne, 0,3Ã‚Â % Espagnole et Tunisienne et 0,2Ã‚Â % Turque[49]., 231625=La dÃƒÂ©mographie ÃƒÂ©conomique de la commune se distingue assez fortement des moyennes nationales et de la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi. On trouve ainsi ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge une proportion presque double dÃ¢Â€Â™artisans et commerÃƒÂ§ants que dans la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi, plus dÃ¢Â€Â™employÃƒÂ©s et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse nettement moins dÃ¢Â€Â™ouvriers. Les secteurs dÃ¢Â€Â™activitÃƒÂ©s oÃƒÂ¹ exerce la population est elle aussi relativement diffÃƒÂ©rente avec une rÃƒÂ©partition plus importante dans la construction et les services aux particuliers ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge que dans le reste du bassin et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse un net dÃƒÂ©ficit dans lÃ¢Â€Â™industrie, les services aux entreprises, dÃƒÂ» principalement au fait quÃ¢Â€Â™aucune entreprise dÃ¢Â€Â™envergure dans ces secteurs nÃ¢Â€Â™est implantÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  proximitÃƒÂ©. Parmi la population ayant un emploi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 80Ã‚Â % disposait dÃ¢Â€Â™un statut de titulaire de la fonction publique ou dÃ¢Â€Â™un contrat ÃƒÂ  durÃƒÂ©e indÃƒÂ©terminÃƒÂ©e. Le revenu net imposable moyen ÃƒÂ©tait fixÃƒÂ© en 2006 ÃƒÂ  26Ã‚Â 290 euros mais 31Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages ne payaient pas dÃ¢Â€Â™impÃƒÂ´t sur le revenu. PrÃƒÂ¨s de 66Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait propriÃƒÂ©taire de son logement, un pavillon dans 55Ã‚Â % des cas[138]. Le revenu fiscal mÃƒÂ©dian par mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ©tait en 2006 de 21Ã‚Â 651 euros, ce qui plaÃƒÂ§ait Savigny-sur-Orge au mille six cent sixiÃƒÂ¨me rang parmi les 30Ã‚Â 687 communes de plus de cinquante mÃƒÂ©nages en mÃƒÂ©tropole et au cent vingt-neuviÃƒÂ¨me rang dÃƒÂ©partemental[139]., 93024=En 1801, Pauline de Beaumont loua le domaine de Courte-rente pour abriter ses amours avec FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand. En 1802, Louis Nicolas Davout acquit le chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny et y fit dÃ¢Â€Â™importants travaux. En 1854, Charles Petit, propriÃƒÂ©taire de la ferme de Champagne crÃƒÂ©a une usine dÃ¢Â€Â™expÃƒÂ©rimentation de distillation de la betterave sucriÃƒÂ¨re. En 1855, Louis Adolf Duval, futur maire de la commune fonde une manufacture de fleurs artificielles. En 1869, la reine dÃ¢Â€Â™Espagne Isabelle II en exil sÃƒÂ©journa au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny., 228206=La commune de Savigny-sur-Orge est principalement occupÃƒÂ©e par des espaces dÃ¢Â€Â™habitation, elle se rapproche ainsi du concept de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â banlieue dortoirÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». Le commerce joue un rÃƒÂ´le important dans la vie ÃƒÂ©conomique avec un centre-ville actif et deux marchÃƒÂ©s organisÃƒÂ©s, le marchÃƒÂ© Jules Ferry qui se tient les jeudis et samedis et le marchÃƒÂ© Davout qui a lieu chaque mardi, vendredi et dimanche[135]. La commune accueillait en 2006 1Ã‚Â 297 entreprises dont 739 dans le seul secteur des services. Elle ne dispose cependant que dÃ¢Â€Â™une petite zone d'activitÃƒÂ©s industrielles et commerciales au nord-ouest, implantÃƒÂ©e en bordure de lÃ¢Â€Â™autoroute A6. Dans cette zone se regroupent principalement des entreprises de services employant relativement peu de salariÃƒÂ©s. Ainsi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 85Ã‚Â % des actifs de la commune ÃƒÂ©taient contraint de se rentre dans une autre commune ou un autre dÃƒÂ©partement pour exercer leur activitÃƒÂ©. Plusieurs supermarchÃƒÂ©s sont rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire, complÃƒÂ©tant lÃ¢Â€Â™offre de commerces de proximitÃƒÂ© dense. Trois hÃƒÂ´tels regroupent un total de cent cinquante-deux chambres[136].

En 1999, la proportion de jeunes de moins de vingt-cinq ans reprÃƒÂ©sentait 30,5Ã‚Â % dans la commune et les familles monoparentales comptaient pour 11,0Ã‚Â % de la population[52]., 102740=LÃ¢Â€Â™urbanisation sÃ¢Â€Â™acheva en 1992 avec lÃ¢Â€Â™amÃƒÂ©nagement de la zone d'amÃƒÂ©nagement concertÃƒÂ© des GÃƒÂ¢tines[47]. En 1999, la commune se dota dÃ¢Â€Â™un nouvel hÃƒÂ´tel de ville. Savigny-sur-Orge fut la premiÃƒÂ¨re ville ÃƒÂ  avoir pris la dÃƒÂ©cision dÃ¢Â€Â™un couvre-feu de vingt-deux heure ÃƒÂ  sept heures du matin pour les mineurs, lors des ÃƒÂ©meutes de novembre 2005., 95847=En 1916, la ferme de Champagne fut vendue et accueillie un centre de rÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©ducation des victimes de guerre inaugurÃƒÂ© en 1917 par le prÃƒÂ©sident de la RÃƒÂ©publique Raymond PoincarÃƒÂ©[40].

Un centre d'information et d'orientation est implantÃƒÂ© dans la commune[109]., 96675=Au sortir de la PremiÃƒÂ¨re Guerre mondiale, lÃ¢Â€Â™afflux de provinciaux dans la rÃƒÂ©gion capitale et la politique en faveur du logement social modifiÃƒÂ¨rent la physionomie de la commune. Entre 1923 et 1935, des lotissements pavillonnaires remplace les champs et vergers au nord et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™est du centre-ville, dÃ¢Â€Â™abord pour la villÃƒÂ©giature des parisiens puis pour le logement des nouveaux employÃƒÂ©s et ouvriers. Outre la construction dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipements publics, la viabilisation des nouveaux quartiers fut entreprise ÃƒÂ  partir de 1928 et des 1931, prÃƒÂ¨s de 70Ã‚Â % des Saviniens rÃƒÂ©sidaient sur le plateau. En 1929, pour accompagner cette croissance dÃƒÂ©mographique fut construit le groupe scolaire Jules Ferry, suivit en 1931 par lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Sainte-ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se et en 1936 par le groupe Aristide Briand.

Les Trente Glorieuses entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ¨rent un nouvel afflux de population, rapidement logÃƒÂ©e dans les grands ensembles implantÃƒÂ©s dans le parc du chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux entre 1960 et 1966, ÃƒÂ  Clair Village entre 1967 et 1971 et aux PrÃƒÂ©s-Saint-Martin entre 1970 et 1972[44]. Les groupes scolaires Kennedy et Saint-ExupÃƒÂ©ry et lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Notre-Dame-de-lÃ¢Â€Â™EspÃƒÂ©rance accompagnÃƒÂ¨rent cette urbanisation entre 1962 et 1964. Entre 1953 et 1960, le parc de Grand Vaux fut coupÃƒÂ© en deux par la nouvelle autoroute A6 qui reliait ainsi directement la commune aux portes de Paris. Le 24 mai 1969, Savigny-sur-Orge accueillit un meeting de campagne du candidat Georges Pompidou[45]. Entre 1978 et 1979, Savigny-sur-Orge fut ÃƒÂ  nouveau sous le feu des projecteurs lors de lÃ¢Â€Â™affaire Empain[46]., 90473=Au XIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle fut ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e sur le plateau la ferme de Champagne. LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Saint-Martin fut ÃƒÂ©difiÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  cette ÃƒÂ©poque par les moines de lÃ¢Â€Â™abbaye de Longpont. Pendant la guerre de Cent Ans, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise comme beaucoup dÃ¢Â€Â™autres de la rÃƒÂ©gion fut ravagÃƒÂ©e puis reconstruite. En 1475, ÃƒÂ‰tienne de Vesc, chambellan de Charles VIII, acquit le domaine de Savigny. Entre 1485 et 1488, il ÃƒÂ©tendit le domaine sur la Champagne et le bois de Viry. En 1493, lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise agrandie fut consacrÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. En 1587 furent installÃƒÂ©es quatre cloches ÃƒÂ  Saint-Martin. Charles-FranÃƒÂ§ois de Vintimille du Luc hÃƒÂ©rita de la seigneurie et mourut au chÃƒÂ¢teau en 1740. Au XVIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, Marie-Nicolas Pigeon, avocat au Parlement de Paris fit construire le domaine de Courte-rente. Entre 1635 et 1797, le domaine de Grand Vaux passa entre diffÃƒÂ©rentes mains. Pierre Vigier lÃ¢Â€Â™acquit en 1797 et lÃ¢Â€Â™agrandit jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  sa mort en 1817, le parc couvrant alors cent hectares., 163034=Le 29 septembre 2008, ÃƒÂ  la suite du dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ¨s de son prÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©cesseur Jean Marsaudon, Laurence Spicher-Bernier a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©lue maire. NÃƒÂ©e le 16 juin 1961 dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris, ses parents se sont installÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge en 1964 dans le quartier populaire de Grand-Vaux. EmployÃƒÂ©e de banque pendant dix-sept ans, elle est ensuite agent immobilier. PrÃƒÂ©sidente de lÃ¢Â€Â™association des commerÃƒÂ§ants de Savigny-sur-Orge pendant quinze ans, elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© pendant dix ans Conseiller prudÃ¢Â€Â™hommes[73],[74]. Le 6 septembre 2011, Laurence Spicher-Bernier est condamnÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  huit mois de prison avec sursis par le tribunal correctionnel d'Evry pour exercice illÃƒÂ©gal de la profession dÃ¢Â€Â™avocat et usage illicite du titre de conseil[75]. Membre du Parti radical[76], elle a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© exclue en mars 2012 de l'UMP pour avoir prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© une candidature dissidente aux ÃƒÂ©lections lÃƒÂ©gislatives[77]. En 2014, ÃƒÂ  l'issue d'un second tour marquÃƒÂ© par une quadrangulaire, Eric Mehlhorn devient Maire de Savigny-sur-Orge., 268829=Savigny-sur-Orge sÃ¢Â€Â™est dotÃƒÂ©e en 1990 dÃ¢Â€Â™un logotype, il fut modernisÃƒÂ© en 2004. Il ÃƒÂ©tait voulu plus dynamique avec la prÃƒÂ©sence de rouge et d'un Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â SÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» stylisÃƒÂ© et symbolisant la croissance de la commune en s'ÃƒÂ©tirant vers le haut[156]., 215596=Le sport ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge se pratique en divers lieux rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire. La commune dispose ainsi du parc des sports Jean Moulin complÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© par la maison du tennis et lÃ¢Â€Â™espace Jean Laguionie, des complexes sportifs David Douillet, Pierre de Coubertin et LÃƒÂ©on Cheymol, du gymnase John Fitzgerald Kennedy, de la salle polyvalente Aristide Briand, du boulodrome Pierre Mathieu et de la salle dÃ¢Â€Â™haltÃƒÂ©rophilie Mamadou Lamine Loum[131]. La commune a mis en place des ÃƒÂ©coles municipales du sport et du cirque. Elle organise depuis 1990 les Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â FoulÃƒÂ©es de SavignyÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» une course dÃ¢Â€Â™endurance de la marche au semi-marathon. La commune accueille en rÃƒÂ©sidence lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe des Lions de Savigny-sur-Orge, club de baseball fondÃƒÂ© en 1982 qui ÃƒÂ©volue en championnat de France. S'ajoutent diverses disciplines regroupÃƒÂ©es au sein du club olympique Savigny (handball, basket-ball et football)., 108367=En 2012, la commune comptait 37Ã‚Â 135Ã‚Â habitants. L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 104920=AujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui quatriÃƒÂ¨me commune du dÃƒÂ©partement en nombre dÃ¢Â€Â™habitants, Savigny-sur-Orge a connu comme de nombreuses villes de lÃ¢Â€Â™agglomÃƒÂ©ration parisienne une explosion urbanistique et dÃƒÂ©mographique au cours du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, entamÃƒÂ©e dÃƒÂ¨s les annÃƒÂ©es 1920. Lors du premier recensement des personnes en 1793, la nouvelle commune nÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait quÃ¢Â€Â™un village de mille cinq habitants, qui connut par la suite une forte baisse puis une ÃƒÂ©volution chaotique, jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  ne compter que huit cent vingt-trois rÃƒÂ©sidents en 1800. Elle ne dÃƒÂ©passa ÃƒÂ  nouveau le cap des mille personnes que lors du recensement de 1856, date ÃƒÂ  partir de laquelle la croissance se poursuivit de faÃƒÂ§on relativement linÃƒÂ©aire et lente, pour nÃ¢Â€Â™approcher le nombre de deux mille rÃƒÂ©sidents quÃ¢Â€Â™en 1921. En 1926 dÃƒÂ©buta une pÃƒÂ©riode de dÃƒÂ©veloppement plus rapide avec dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  prÃƒÂ¨s de cinq mille six cent habitants et trÃƒÂ¨s vite plus de onze mille dÃƒÂ¨s 1931. Le second conflit mondial eut un impact limitÃƒÂ© sur cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1946 la population ÃƒÂ©tait passÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  quatorze mille cinq cent cinquante quatre personnes puis plus de dix sept mille en 1954, vingt-quatre mille en 1962 et prÃƒÂ¨s de trente quatre mille cinq cent en 1975. Le recensement de 1982 fut marquÃƒÂ© par une nette diminution avec la perte de deux mille habitants avant une reprise de la croissance jusquÃ¢Â€Â™au chiffre ÃƒÂ©tablit en 2006 ÃƒÂ  trente sept mille deux cent cinquante neuf Saviniens. LÃ¢Â€Â™immigration compte pour une part relativement importante dans cette ÃƒÂ©volution puisquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1999, 8,2Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©trangÃƒÂ¨re[48]. Parmi cette population, 3,2Ã‚Â % ÃƒÂ©tait de nationalitÃƒÂ© Portugaise, 0,9Ã‚Â % Marocaine, 0,8Ã‚Â % AlgÃƒÂ©rienne, 0,5Ã‚Â % Italienne, 0,3Ã‚Â % Espagnole et Tunisienne et 0,2Ã‚Â % Turque[49]., 231625=La dÃƒÂ©mographie ÃƒÂ©conomique de la commune se distingue assez fortement des moyennes nationales et de la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi. On trouve ainsi ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge une proportion presque double dÃ¢Â€Â™artisans et commerÃƒÂ§ants que dans la zone dÃ¢Â€Â™emploi, plus dÃ¢Â€Â™employÃƒÂ©s et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse nettement moins dÃ¢Â€Â™ouvriers. Les secteurs dÃ¢Â€Â™activitÃƒÂ©s oÃƒÂ¹ exerce la population est elle aussi relativement diffÃƒÂ©rente avec une rÃƒÂ©partition plus importante dans la construction et les services aux particuliers ÃƒÂ  Savigny-sur-Orge que dans le reste du bassin et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse un net dÃƒÂ©ficit dans lÃ¢Â€Â™industrie, les services aux entreprises, dÃƒÂ» principalement au fait quÃ¢Â€Â™aucune entreprise dÃ¢Â€Â™envergure dans ces secteurs nÃ¢Â€Â™est implantÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  proximitÃƒÂ©. Parmi la population ayant un emploi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 80Ã‚Â % disposait dÃ¢Â€Â™un statut de titulaire de la fonction publique ou dÃ¢Â€Â™un contrat ÃƒÂ  durÃƒÂ©e indÃƒÂ©terminÃƒÂ©e. Le revenu net imposable moyen ÃƒÂ©tait fixÃƒÂ© en 2006 ÃƒÂ  26Ã‚Â 290 euros mais 31Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages ne payaient pas dÃ¢Â€Â™impÃƒÂ´t sur le revenu. PrÃƒÂ¨s de 66Ã‚Â % de la population ÃƒÂ©tait propriÃƒÂ©taire de son logement, un pavillon dans 55Ã‚Â % des cas[138]. Le revenu fiscal mÃƒÂ©dian par mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ©tait en 2006 de 21Ã‚Â 651 euros, ce qui plaÃƒÂ§ait Savigny-sur-Orge au mille six cent sixiÃƒÂ¨me rang parmi les 30Ã‚Â 687 communes de plus de cinquante mÃƒÂ©nages en mÃƒÂ©tropole et au cent vingt-neuviÃƒÂ¨me rang dÃƒÂ©partemental[139]., 93024=En 1801, Pauline de Beaumont loua le domaine de Courte-rente pour abriter ses amours avec FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand. En 1802, Louis Nicolas Davout acquit le chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny et y fit dÃ¢Â€Â™importants travaux. En 1854, Charles Petit, propriÃƒÂ©taire de la ferme de Champagne crÃƒÂ©a une usine dÃ¢Â€Â™expÃƒÂ©rimentation de distillation de la betterave sucriÃƒÂ¨re. En 1855, Louis Adolf Duval, futur maire de la commune fonde une manufacture de fleurs artificielles. En 1869, la reine dÃ¢Â€Â™Espagne Isabelle II en exil sÃƒÂ©journa au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny., 228206=La commune de Savigny-sur-Orge est principalement occupÃƒÂ©e par des espaces dÃ¢Â€Â™habitation, elle se rapproche ainsi du concept de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â banlieue dortoirÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». Le commerce joue un rÃƒÂ´le important dans la vie ÃƒÂ©conomique avec un centre-ville actif et deux marchÃƒÂ©s organisÃƒÂ©s, le marchÃƒÂ© Jules Ferry qui se tient les jeudis et samedis et le marchÃƒÂ© Davout qui a lieu chaque mardi, vendredi et dimanche[135]. La commune accueillait en 2006 1Ã‚Â 297 entreprises dont 739 dans le seul secteur des services. Elle ne dispose cependant que dÃ¢Â€Â™une petite zone d'activitÃƒÂ©s industrielles et commerciales au nord-ouest, implantÃƒÂ©e en bordure de lÃ¢Â€Â™autoroute A6. Dans cette zone se regroupent principalement des entreprises de services employant relativement peu de salariÃƒÂ©s. Ainsi, prÃƒÂ¨s de 85Ã‚Â % des actifs de la commune ÃƒÂ©taient contraint de se rentre dans une autre commune ou un autre dÃƒÂ©partement pour exercer leur activitÃƒÂ©. Plusieurs supermarchÃƒÂ©s sont rÃƒÂ©partis sur le territoire, complÃƒÂ©tant lÃ¢Â€Â™offre de commerces de proximitÃƒÂ© dense. Trois hÃƒÂ´tels regroupent un total de cent cinquante-deux chambres[136]. Elle est aujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui intÃƒÂ©grÃƒÂ©e par lÃ¢Â€Â™Insee au bassin d'emploi dÃ¢Â€Â™Orly qui regroupait en 2006 469Ã‚Â 279 habitants, les Saviniens reprÃƒÂ©sentant 8Ã‚Â % du total[137]. Dans cette zone, la population active comptait 232Ã‚Â 993 personnes mais seulement 210Ã‚Â 476 personnes avaient un emploi. Dans la commune, la population active comptait 18Ã‚Â 556 personnes et 16Ã‚Â 859 avaient un emploi., 139410=La commune adhÃƒÂ©ra en 2013 ÃƒÂ  la communautÃƒÂ© d'agglomÃƒÂ©ration Les Portes de l'Essonne[64] et coopÃƒÂ©rait avec les communes voisines dans le cadre du syndicat mixte Orge-Yvette-Seine, du syndicat mixte pour la revalorisation et l'ÃƒÂ©limination des dÃƒÂ©chets et ordures mÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ¨res[65] et du syndicat mixte d'amÃƒÂ©nagement hydraulique de la VallÃƒÂ©e de l'Yvette[66]. La commune sÃ¢Â€Â™est dotÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢Â€Â™un office de tourisme., 268513=Le blason crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ© en 1952 par un Savinien est inspirÃƒÂ© de celui du marÃƒÂ©chal Davout. Le semis de fleurs de lys rappelle que Savigny est situÃƒÂ© dans lÃ¢Â€Â™ancienne province dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂŽle-de-France dont la fleur de lys ÃƒÂ©tait lÃ¢Â€Â™emblÃƒÂ¨me., 118821=LÃ¢Â€Â™analyse comparÃƒÂ©e des pyramides des ÃƒÂ¢ges de Savigny-sur-Orge et du dÃƒÂ©partement de lÃ¢Â€Â™Essonne ÃƒÂ©tablies en 2006 montre une relative similaritÃƒÂ© de rÃƒÂ©partition des catÃƒÂ©gories dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ges dans la population, avec nÃƒÂ©anmoins quelques variations, ÃƒÂ  la baisse dans la commune pour les jeunes rÃƒÂ©sidents et ÃƒÂ  la hausse pour les populations masculines entre trente et soixante-quatorze ans. ÃƒÂ€ lÃ¢Â€Â™inverse, dans la commune, les femmes sont moins reprÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©es que dans le reste du dÃƒÂ©partement jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ge de cinquante-neuf ans puis largement plus nombreuses pour les trois tranches dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ¢ges suivantes. En 1999, la proportion de jeunes de moins de vingt-cinq ans reprÃƒÂ©sentait 30,5Ã‚Â % dans la commune et les familles monoparentales comptaient pour 11,0Ã‚Â % de la population[52]., 102740=LÃ¢Â€Â™urbanisation sÃ¢Â€Â™acheva en 1992 avec lÃ¢Â€Â™amÃƒÂ©nagement de la zone d'amÃƒÂ©nagement concertÃƒÂ© des GÃƒÂ¢tines[47]. En 1999, la commune se dota dÃ¢Â€Â™un nouvel hÃƒÂ´tel de ville. Savigny-sur-Orge fut la premiÃƒÂ¨re ville ÃƒÂ  avoir pris la dÃƒÂ©cision dÃ¢Â€Â™un couvre-feu de vingt-deux heure ÃƒÂ  sept heures du matin pour les mineurs, lors des ÃƒÂ©meutes de novembre 2005., 95847=En 1916, la ferme de Champagne fut vendue et accueillie un centre de rÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©ducation des victimes de guerre inaugurÃƒÂ© en 1917 par le prÃƒÂ©sident de la RÃƒÂ©publique Raymond PoincarÃƒÂ©[40]. La mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e, des hÃƒÂ´pitaux militaires furent installÃƒÂ©s au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Grand Vaux et au chÃƒÂ¢teau de Savigny., 195963=Les ÃƒÂ©coles Aristide Briand, Champagne, FranÃƒÂ§ois-RenÃƒÂ© de Chateaubriand, Jules Ferry, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Louise Michel, des Marguerites, Jean Mermoz, Paul Bert et Antoine de Saint-ExupÃƒÂ©ry servent en dehors des pÃƒÂ©riodes scolaires de centres de loisirs.

Une halte-garderie complÃƒÂ¨te lÃ¢Â€Â™offre[107]. Trois maisons de quartier ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© mises en place ÃƒÂ  Grand Vaux, PrÃƒÂ©s-Saint-Martin et Sainte-ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se. La FÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration des conseils de parents d'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves[108] et la FÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ration des parents d'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ves de l'enseignement public sont reprÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©es dans les ÃƒÂ©tablissements de la commune. Un centre d'information et d'orientation est implantÃƒÂ© dans la commune[109]., 96675=Au sortir de la PremiÃƒÂ¨re Guerre mondiale, lÃ¢Â€Â™afflux de provinciaux dans la rÃƒÂ©gion capitale et la politique en faveur du logement social modifiÃƒÂ¨rent la physionomie de la commune. Entre 1923 et 1935, des lotissements pavillonnaires remplace les champs et vergers au nord et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™est du centre-ville, dÃ¢Â€Â™abord pour la villÃƒÂ©giature des parisiens puis pour le logement des nouveaux employÃƒÂ©s et ouvriers. Outre la construction dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipements publics, la viabilisation des nouveaux quartiers fut entreprise ÃƒÂ  partir de 1928 et des 1931, prÃƒÂ¨s de 70Ã‚Â % des Saviniens rÃƒÂ©sidaient sur le plateau. En 1929, pour accompagner cette croissance dÃƒÂ©mographique fut construit le groupe scolaire Jules Ferry, suivit en 1931 par lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©glise Sainte-ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se et en 1936 par le groupe Aristide Briand.

Celle-ci a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© non seulement un des pionniÃƒÂ¨res quant au traitement d'images sur le Macintosh mais aussi une des premiÃƒÂ¨res qui ont fait de la publicitÃƒÂ© pour des produits comme des digitizers (numÃƒÂ©riseur) vidÃƒÂ©o parmi lesquelles on trouve Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â ProVizÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» de Pixelogic's et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â TrueScanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» de Truvel. Ceci ÃƒÂ©tait le premier scanner encreur professionnel qui a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ© pour la premiÃƒÂ¨re fois au Cebit ÃƒÂ  Hanovre en 1988. L'entreprise a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© invitÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  se prÃƒÂ©senter au CeBIT par Apple., 8303=Karl-Heinz Zahorsky a souvent publiÃƒÂ© des articles sur le traitement d'images numÃƒÂ©riques ÃƒÂ  l'ordinateur de bureau dans des magazines spÃƒÂ©cialistes. En 1990, l'entreprise Hell engagea Karl Heinz Zahorstky et son entreprise comme conseiller pour l'intÃƒÂ©gration des technologies ÃƒÂ  l'ordinateur de bureau qui se dÃƒÂ©veloppaient rapidement. En 1991, LaserSoft Imaging a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© enregistrÃƒÂ© comme GmbH allemand et s'est installÃƒÂ© dans un grand ÃƒÂ©tablissement de reproduction avec l'intention d'accÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©rer l'intÃƒÂ©gration de la reproduction de couleurs ÃƒÂ  l'ordinateur et de faire accessible des systÃƒÂ¨mes de Chroma chrome pour le Macintosh., 5413=SilverFast Version 5.0 a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© publiÃƒÂ© en 2000, version 6.0 en 2002. La version 6.5, qu'on a complÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©e en 2006, est suivie par la version rÃƒÂ©cente 6.6. de mai 2008. En 2001, on a transformÃƒÂ© l'entreprise en sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© anonyme. Le fondateur dÃƒÂ©tient 100Ã‚Â % des actions. ÃƒÂ€ l'ÃƒÂ©poque, LaserSoft Imaging AG est la seule entreprise qui a dÃƒÂ©veloppÃƒÂ© un logiciel haut de gamme pour tous les scanners connus sous Mac OS9, OSX et Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, XP et Vista. Les scanners haut de gamme de Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, c'est-ÃƒÂ -dire le Topaz, Tango, Nexscan et Chromagraph (3300 et 3400), dont des milliers sont encore en service, peuvent ÃƒÂªtre utilisÃƒÂ©s mÃƒÂªme sur les systÃƒÂ¨mes d'exploitation rÃƒÂ©cents. DÃƒÂ¨s 2005, LaserSoft Imaging est le seul dÃƒÂ©veloppeur d'un logiciel pour ces machines. DÃƒÂ©sormais, on a commencÃƒÂ© de mercantiliser SilverFast mondialement. Dans ce contexte, on a conclu des alliances stratÃƒÂ©giques avec des constructeurs comme Canon, HP, Seiko Epson, Cruse, Leica Camera AG, Microtek, Nikon, Pacific Image Electronics, Pentacon GmbH, PFU/Quato, Plustek, Samsung, et Umax. Ce sont des partenaires qui lient leur matÃƒÂ©riel au logiciel SilverFast. En 2008, SilverFast de LaserSoft Imaging AG a gagnÃƒÂ© le prix de l'EDP (European Digital Press Association) dans le catÃƒÂ©gorie Ã‚Â«Meilleur logiciel pour la gestion de la couleur 2008Ã‚Â Ã‚Â» pour l'amÃƒÂ©lioration quant au densitÃƒÂ© par Multi-Exposure (Exposition multiple) pour la plupart des scanners et pour la crÃƒÂ©ation automatique de profiles ICC. 2009, le format HDRi pour les donnÃƒÂ©es brutes a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© dÃƒÂ©veloppÃƒÂ©. Y sont comprises les donnÃƒÂ©es brutes traditionnelles autant que les donnÃƒÂ©es supplÃƒÂ©mentaires du canal infrarouge et donc toutes les informations lisibles pour un traitement ultÃƒÂ©rieur d'images.}"

Led by the full-throated vocals of singer/guitarist Bob Reed, Overwhelming Colorfast does little to expand on the basic formula but delivers a potent slice of emotionally powerful guitar rock nonetheless. Unlike some later emocore bands that concentrated on the more progressive, alternative rock-leaning elements of the style, Overwhelming Colorfast is a bit truer to the simpler, straight-ahead punk sound of early, Metal Circus and New Day Rising-era Husker DÃƒÂ¼. Like most other HÃƒÂ¼sker-influenced bands, though, Reed and company focus almost entirely on the Bob Mould side, and have little of the power pop and '60s AM radio sensibility that made Grant Hart so interesting. The musicanship on Two Words is appropriately ragged and energetic, with drummer Dan Reed's powerful, Dave Grohl-esque skin bashing giving the band's sound a weighty authority. Overall, the album suffers from somewhat unfocused, repetitive songwriting, but remains enjoyable due to undeniably passionate delivery and a hefty dose of monster riffs.

Pemilihan bahan baku. Resiko yang mungkin timbul dari tahapan ini adalah bahan baku yang digunakan mengandung bakteri patogen. Pengendalian kritis dari pemilihan bahan baku adalah pemilihan supplier yang sudah terjamin dari segi kualitasnya. 2. Penggilingan daging yang sudah dibersihkan.

Serta dimulainya tahapan ombrotrophic. Tumbuhan pada ombrotrophic tergantung kepada nutrisi air hujan. Dan ombrotrophic pun miskin akan nutrisi dan tingkat keasaman yang kuat. Komunitas organisme sangat beragam termasuk jenis-jenis ganggang yang melekat (khususnya diatom), berbagai siput dan remis, serangga, crustacea, ikan, amfibi, reptilia air dan semi air seperti kura-kura dan ular, itik dan angsa, dan beberapa mamalia yang sering mencari makan di danau., 137272=Daftar perkembangan pendangkalan Danau Limboto sejak tahun 1934 sampai tahun 1993, 134334=Pendekatan sistem merupakan cara penyelesaian persoalan yang dimulai dengan dilakukannya identifikasi terhadap sejumlah kebutuhan, sehingga dapat menghasilkan suatu operasi sistem yang efektif (Eriyatno, 2007). Konsep sistem yang berlandaskan pada unit keragaman dan selalu mencari keterpaduan antar komponen melalui pemahaman secara holistik (menyeluruh) dan utuh, merupakan suatu alternative pendekatan baru dalam memahami dunia nyata (Forester, 1971). Pendekatan sistem disini dimaksudkan untuk dapat membangun model pengendalian pencemaran dari limbah-limbah yang ada di sekitar danau.

Pada tahun 1960-an luas daerahnya adalah 26.000 kmÃ‚Â², namun pada tahun 2000 telah susut menjadi 1.500 kmÃ‚Â². Hal ini disebabkan oleh berkurangnya curah hujan dan banyaknya air irigasi yang diambil dari danau ini dan sungai-sungai sekitarnya. Diperkirakan bahwa danau ini akan mengering dalam abad ke-21.

Pengendaliannya adalah air yang digunakan untuk merebus haruslah air yang bersih dan bukan air yang telah ditamgpung beberapa hari pada bak penampungan, karena biasanya air yang telah ditampung telah tercemar baik dari logam berat maupun bahan kimia berbahaya lainnya., 12391=Ã¢Â€Â“Ã‚Â  Memastikan bahwa air yang digunakan tidak tercemar oleh logam berat dan bahan kimia lainnya., 12046=Air yang digunakan kemungkinan tercemar logam berat atau bahan kimia organik berbahaya, 121477=Stadia akhir adalah dimana fen dan transisi peat mulai berkembang dan terjadi pendangkalan yaitu dengan sedimen mencapai kepermukaan. Serta dimulainya tahapan ombrotrophic. Tumbuhan pada ombrotrophic tergantung kepada nutrisi air hujan. Dan ombrotrophic pun miskin akan nutrisi dan tingkat keasaman yang kuat. Komunitas organisme sangat beragam termasuk jenis-jenis ganggang yang melekat (khususnya diatom), berbagai siput dan remis, serangga, crustacea, ikan, amfibi, reptilia air dan semi air seperti kura-kura dan ular, itik dan angsa, dan beberapa mamalia yang sering mencari makan di danau., 137272=Daftar perkembangan pendangkalan Danau Limboto sejak tahun 1934 sampai tahun 1993, 134334=Pendekatan sistem merupakan cara penyelesaian persoalan yang dimulai dengan dilakukannya identifikasi terhadap sejumlah kebutuhan, sehingga dapat menghasilkan suatu operasi sistem yang efektif (Eriyatno, 2007). Konsep sistem yang berlandaskan pada unit keragaman dan selalu mencari keterpaduan antar komponen melalui pemahaman secara holistik (menyeluruh) dan utuh, merupakan suatu alternative pendekatan baru dalam memahami dunia nyata (Forester, 1971). Pendekatan sistem disini dimaksudkan untuk dapat membangun model pengendalian pencemaran dari limbah-limbah yang ada di sekitar danau. Sehingga pemanfaatan fungsi danau dapat berkesinambungan., 10691=Ã¢Â€Â“ Memastikan bahwa campuran air yang digunakan tidak tercemar oleh logam berat, 139620=Sedimen yang ditemukan di danau ini menunjukkan beberapa waktu kering, sekitar tahun 8500 SM, 5500 SM, 2000 SM, dan 100 SM. Pada tahun 1960-an luas daerahnya adalah 26.000 kmÃ‚Â², namun pada tahun 2000 telah susut menjadi 1.500 kmÃ‚Â². Hal ini disebabkan oleh berkurangnya curah hujan dan banyaknya air irigasi yang diambil dari danau ini dan sungai-sungai sekitarnya. Diperkirakan bahwa danau ini akan mengering dalam abad ke-21. Kedalaman rata-rata saat ini adalah 1,5 meter., 10309=Proses pengadonan biasanya ada tambahan air, dan air kemungkinan tercemar logam berat atau bahan kimia organik berbahaya, 136280=Pendangkalan danau terjadi karena tingginya sedimentasi akibat pembalakan liar di hulu, daerah aliran sungai yang rusak ikut mempercepat proses sedimentasi. Alhasil, jika musim kemarau datang, kedalaman danau hanya 1,5 meter saja. Kemudian di sisi lain, penyempitan atau penyusutan luas danau terjadi karena berjamurnya pemukiman warga di pinggir danau dan juga keramba-keramba ikan yang sudah ditinggalkan warga. Yang mengagetkan ialah penguasaan lahan di tepi danau tersebut mendapat legalitas dari pemerintah pada tahun 1995 dengan membagikan sertifikat gratis., 124247=Hasil penelitian Hardjowigeno (1987, dalam Arsyad, 2000) dapat ditetapkan besarnya T maksimum untuk tanah-tanah di Indonesia adalah 2.5 mm/thn, yaitu untuk tanah dalam dengan lapisan bawah (subsoil) yang permeabel dengan substratum yang tidak terkonsolidasi (telah mengalami pelapukan). Tanah-tanah yang kedalamannya kurang atau sifat-sifat lapisan bawah yang lebih kedap air atau terletak di atas substratum yang belum melapuk, nilai T harus lebih kecil dari 2.5 mm/thn. Terjadinya erosi dan masuknya sedimen ke danau akan mengakibatkan pengendapan dan pendangkalan sehingga akan mempengaruhi kapasitas tampung danau sehingga mengakibatkan pendangkalan., 130377=b)Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Terjadinya erosi air sungai sekitar danau atau sungai yang mengisi danau, erosi dapat terjadi ketika sungai tidak mampu menanggulangi air hujan dengan aliran yang begitu besar, penyebab hal itu terjadi akibat hutan yang gundul, pembuangan sampah yang tidak tepat oleh masyarakat menyebabkan tersumbatnya aliran sungai sehingga air dengan tekanan tinggi akan mengikis pinggiran sungai dan bermuara ke danau sehingga danau akan mengalami pendangkalan., 118883=Dari tahapan danau Rheotrophic sampai Ombrotrophic yang terjadi setelah tahapan ke-4. Istilah ombrotrophic terjadi di mana air di permukaan tanah adalah acidic, baik dari acidic tanah air, atau tempat air yang seluruhnya berasal dari hujan. Air mengalir dari danau memiliki karakteristik warna coklat, dari larut turf tannins. danau sangat sensitif habitat, yang tinggi penting untuk keanekaragaman hayati.

Issue Date: 2005 Publisher: Ohio State University Abstract: \begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{3.0cm} \vspace{-0.3cm} \hspace*{-0.2cm} \epsfig{file=oxy.eps} \end{wrapfigure} The 351 nm photoelectron spectrum of oxyallyl anion has been measured. The anion is synthesized via reaction of atomic oxygen anion with acetone in He buffer gas in a flowing-afterglow tube. Photodetachment leads to the formation of a ``diradical'' species, oxyallyl, which is isoelectronic with trimethylenemethane (TMM). Both CASSCF(4,4) and B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) electronic structure calculations have been carried out for Franck-Condon simulation of the spectrum. The $^{3}$B$_{2}$ state of oxyallyl appears in the spectrum with a $400\pm40$ $\wn$ vibrational progression of the C-C-C bending motion. Angular distributions of the photoelectrons reveal that the $^{1}$A$_{1}$ state lies very close in energy to the $^{3}$B$_{2}$ state. We tentatively assign the $^{1}$A$_{1}$ state as the ground state, with an electron affinity of $1.945\pm0.010$ eV. The term energy for the $^{3}$B$_{2}$ state is $0.056\pm0.005$ eV. These observations contrast with the photoelectron",False,-1,0,"{24692=Ã‚Â© 2014 The Ohio State University - University Libraries, 25218=1858 Neil Avenue Mall, Columbus, OH 43210}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:42:53 GMT",{314=Please use this identifier to cite or link to this item: http://hdl.handle.net/1811/30286}

This study is part of a long term study of college students drinking patterns and problems by the author and David J. Hanson, SUNY, Potsdam NY. METHODS: a cross sectional design was used. Students were administered the Student Alcohol Questionnaire during each time periods. This highly reliable questionnaire (r=.79) contains 6 items on drinking patterns, 17 items concerning possible consequences of drinking along with other scales. A factor analysis of the 17 problems related to drinking revealed three problem groupings which accounted for 55% of the variance. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed a significant (p <.001) decrease in the Ã¢\x80\x9cDrinking-DrivingÃ¢\x80? factor. Post-hoc Scheffe showed differences occurred between 1982 and each of the later time periods. Results for the Ã¢\x80\x9cHealth-SchoolÃ¢\x80? factor found a significant (p<.0001) increase in these problems over the 10 year time period. For Ã¢\x80\x9cSocial-LegalÃ¢\x80? problems ANOVA, revealed a significant (p <.001) increase over the decade. Post-hoc Scheffe revealed the differences for these two factors were between the early 1980 and 1988 and 1991 time periods. CONCLUSIONS: a decrease in drinking and driving related problems began around 1981 and continued over the ten year time period even before the 21-year- old purchase law in 1987. On the other hand, other problems related to risky drinking increased after this public policy. Few differences between the first two time periods, at the beginning of the decade, or between the time periods after 1987 were found. The differences occurred between the early1980s and the time periods after the Ã¢\x80\x9c21 year old drinking lawÃ¢\x80? had been implemented in 1987. Although research by many authors have reported a decrease in alcohol consumption from around 1980 among all age groups, the proportion of Ã¢\x80\x9cbingeÃ¢\x80? or high risk drinkers has not decreased. The results of this study leads to the conclusion that among this sample of students, the current drinking law is not effective in reducing problems related to alcohol other than for drinking and driving.', 'en_US', 'This work is licensed for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license.

Tips for prospective students Attend the freshmen events that they hold during Labor Day weekend (examples: Farmington River tubing, paintball, etc.). These give you the opportunity to make friends who enjoy the same types of activities that you do. Bang for the buck Western New England College provides great merit aid as well as other forms of scholarships, making it possible for anyone to attend. Though its private institution tuition may seem high, the deduction in tuition from scholarship aid makes it affordable for anyone. Am enjoying being here",True,0,0,"{181706=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 35812=There is a lot of stuff to do on weekends. At the cafe the late night (a program on campus) always puts on events from 9 o'clock to 2 a.m. CAB another program does events a little earlier usually from 6 or 7 to as late as 10 or 11. There's usually a lot to do. My favorite thing is their destress week. They do a lot of destressing things the week before finals. Like massages, stress balls, music, dancing, crafts. You go for an hour or two to relax.}",,

During this time, women have the choice to take either no pill or placebos (pills containing no active drug) for 7 days, in order to avoid disturbing the daily habit of taking the pill. Many women find the 28 day packs helpful for not forgetting to take the pill, but in the end you should choose the solution that is most convenient for you. Package Size: 21 or 28 tablets? Biphasic pills try to recreate your body's natural hormonal cycle. This pill provides a lower amount of progestin in the first half of the cycle and increases that amount in the second, all the while keeping estrogen levels constant. The triphasic pill causes both the estrogen and progestin levels to vary in accordance with the cycle. Both biphasic and triphasic pills mirror the body's natural cycle to reduce the likelihood of side effects. There are also low-dose pills which contain less than 50mcg of estrogen for women who have stronger reactions to the common dose. However the impact of low-dose pills on regulating the effects of the menstrual cycle (e.g. bleeding) is also reduced. In the multiphasic category, you'll find biphasic and triphasic pills: Pills differ mostly according to their dosage in estrogen and progestin. Thus you can break down the different types of pills into monophasic Ã¢Â€Â“ where a pill","Common side effects It is quite common for the pill to cause some temporary side effects, which include mood swings, tender or sore breasts, headaches, breakthrough bleeding and spotting and nausea. These side effects normally go away after the first three months. If they donÃ¢Â€Â™t pass, you could try a different pill instead. Are there any serious risks? The pill can raise your blood pressure. It has also been linked to an increased risk of getting breast cancer and thrombosis (blood clots). However, it reduces your risk of getting non-cancerous breast disease, fibroids and ovarian cysts. Does the pill interact with other medications? The pill interacts with some types of medication, so if you are concerned you should speak to a doctor or read the patient information leaflet. The medications it interacts with include some types of antibiotics (including rifampicin and rifabutin - most commonly used to treat tuberculosis and meningitis); epilepsy medication, St JohnÃ¢Â€Â™s Wort and HIV medications (all of which speed up the time it takes for your liver to break down progestogen).
