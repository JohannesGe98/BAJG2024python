The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (Ã¢Â€ÂœNAVÃ¢Â€?), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place ( e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a Ã¢Â€ÂœfloatingÃ¢Â€? NAV.

The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (Ã¢Â€ÂœNAVÃ¢Â€?), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place ( e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a Ã¢Â€ÂœfloatingÃ¢Â€? NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion to impose a liquidity fee if a fund's weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to Ã¢Â€ÂœgateÃ¢Â€? funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund's weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund's board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC., 69137=We are proposing a rule under the Securities Act of 1933 to provide that certain communications involving security-based swaps that may be purchased only by eligible contract participants will not be deemed for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act to constitute offers of such security-based swaps or any guarantees of such security-based swaps that are securities. Under the proposed rule, the publication or distribution of price quotes relating to security-based swaps that may be purchased only by persons who are eligible contract participants and are traded or processed on or through a facility that either is registered as a national securities exchange or as a security-based swap execution facility, or is exempt from registration as a security-based swap execution facility pursuant to a rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, would not be deemed to constitute an offer, an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or purchase such security-based swaps or any guarantees of such security-based swaps that are securities for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 21806 - Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions Under the Securities Act (Regulation A) 2015-04-20; vol. 80 # 75 - Monday, April 20, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

The asset-level information is required to be provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (Ã¢Â€ÂœXMLÃ¢Â€?). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria., 25112=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€?) is adopting amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds (or Ã¢Â€Âœmoney market fundsÃ¢Â€?) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Ã¢Â€ÂœInvestment Company ActÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœActÃ¢Â€?). The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (Ã¢Â€ÂœNAVÃ¢Â€?), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place ( e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a Ã¢Â€ÂœfloatingÃ¢Â€? NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion to impose a liquidity fee if a fund's weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to Ã¢Â€ÂœgateÃ¢Â€? funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund's weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund's board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC., 69137=We are proposing a rule under the Securities Act of 1933 to provide that certain communications involving security-based swaps that may be purchased only by eligible contract participants will not be deemed for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act to constitute offers of such security-based swaps or any guarantees of such security-based swaps that are securities. Under the proposed rule, the publication or distribution of price quotes relating to security-based swaps that may be purchased only by persons who are eligible contract participants and are traded or processed on or through a facility that either is registered as a national securities exchange or as a security-based swap execution facility, or is exempt from registration as a security-based swap execution facility pursuant to a rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, would not be deemed to constitute an offer, an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or purchase such security-based swaps or any guarantees of such security-based swaps that are securities for purposes of Section 5 of the Securities Act.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 21806 - Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions Under the Securities Act (Regulation A) 2015-04-20; vol. 80 # 75 - Monday, April 20, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults.

The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults.

The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults.

The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults.

The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults.

The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

This document corrects errors in the preamble and regulatory text of the final rule., 111921=OSHA last issued rules for the construction of transmission and distribution installations in 1972. Those provisions are now out of date and inconsistent with the more recently promulgated general industry standard covering the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution lines and equipment. OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection.

A more detailed description of the procedures used to implement the delegation is set forth in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between ADEQ and EPA, dated September 17, 2014, a copy of which may be found in the docket for this rulemaking, as discussed below. The delegation only encompasses sources subject to one or more Federal section 112 standards (Part 63 standards specifically) which are also subject to the requirements of the Title V operating permits program. The delegation of authority under this action does not include authorities contained in CAA section 112(r)., 106186=On January 30, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines and the Standards of Performance for Stationary Internal Combustion Engines. Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. On September 5, 2013, the EPA announced reconsideration of and requested public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration. A summary of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice of reconsideration and the EPA's responses to those comments (Response to Comment document) can be found in the rulemaking docket at Docket Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0708. After careful consideration of the public comments received on the September 5, 2013, notice, the EPA has determined that it will not propose any changes to the regulations at this time related to the three petition issues, and is providing notice of this decision. The EPA is informing the petitioners of the decision in separate letters to the petitioners. The letters explain the EPA's reasons for not proposing changes to the regulations for those three issues. Further discussion of the three petition issues can be found in the Response to Comment document., 84379=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action on its reconsideration of the startup and shutdown provisions in the final rules titled, Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- and Oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units.Ã¢Â€? The national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) issued pursuant to Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 are referred to as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), and the new source performance standards (NSPS) issued pursuant to CAA section 111 are referred to as the Utility NSPS. On November 30, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted reconsideration of, proposed, and requested comment on a limited set of issues in the February 16, 2012, final MATS and Utility NSPS, including certain issues related to the final work practice standards applicable during startup periods and shutdown periods. On June 25, 2013, the EPA reopened the public comment period for the reconsideration issues related to the startup and shutdown provisions of MATS and the startup and shutdown provisions related to the particulate matter (PM) standard in the Utility NSPS. The EPA is now taking final action on the standards applicable during startup periods and shutdown periods in MATS and on startup and shutdown provisions related to the PM standard in the Utility NSPS., 261460=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the December 8, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Secondary Aluminum ProductionÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 15 days., 23185=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is providing notice that it has responded to 23 petitions for reconsideration of the final rules titled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance (NSPS) for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units, published in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012.

The Administrator denied the remaining requests for reconsideration in separate letters to the petitioners dated April 21, 2015. A document providing a full explanation of the agency's rationale for each denial is in the docket for these rules., 3331=This action finalizes amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants. On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the NESHAP and the new source performance standards (NSPS) for the Portland cement industry. Subsequently, the EPA became aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and thus issued a proposal to correct these errors on November 19, 2014 (79 FR 68821). The EPA received 3 comments on the proposal. In response to the comments received and to complete technical corrections, the EPA is now issuing final amendments. In addition, consistent with the U.S. Court of Appeals to the DC Circuit's vacatur of the affirmative defense provisions in the final rule, this action removes those provisions. These amendments do not affect the pollution reduction or costs associated with these standards., 36966=On November 19, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amending certain reporting requirements in the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Steam Generating Units (Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)) rule. This final rule amends the reporting requirements in the MATS rule by temporarily requiring owners or operators of affected sources to submit certain required emissions and compliance reports to the EPA through the Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System (ECMPS) Client Tool, and the rule temporarily suspends the requirement for owners or operators of affected sources to submit certain reports using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI)., 265980=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the December 8, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Primary Aluminum Reduction PlantsÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 15 days., 373027=This action supplements our proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on November 23, 2011. In that action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments based on the initial technology and residual risk reviews for this source category. Today's action presents a revised technology review and a revised residual risk review for the Ferroalloys Production source category and proposes revisions to the standards based on those reviews. This action also proposes new compliance requirements to meet the revised standards. This action would result in significant environmental improvements through the reduction of fugitive manganese emissions and through more stringent emission limits for several processes., 293590=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the November 13, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNESHAP Risk and Technology Review for the Mineral Wool and Wool Fiberglass Industries; NESHAP for Wool Fiberglass Area SourcesÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 30 days., 117839=Title 40 published on 2014-07-01, 339901=This action proposes amendments in addition to those proposed on November 25, 2011, and April 15, 2013, for the Mineral Wool Production and Wool Fiberglass Manufacturing source categories. This action addresses comments received on previous proposals, explains changes to previously proposed limits for sources in these industries and clarifies our use of the upper prediction limit (UPL) in setting MACT floors. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking comments on only aspects of the proposed rules that are discussed in this document. When finalized, these proposed standards would increase the level of environmental protection., 166529=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the February 6, 2015, receipt of a complete petition document titled Ã¢Â€ÂœPetition To Add n-Propyl Bromide to the List of Hazardous Air PollutantsÃ¢Â€? is being extended by 60 days., 255742=On January 31, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers and process heaters at major sources of HAP. Subsequently, the EPA received 10 petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on three issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. The EPA is seeking comment only on these three issues. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule. Additionally, the EPA is proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule to clarify definitions, references, applicability and compliance issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 17998=In this action the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalizes its proposed determination that the EPA completed its statutory obligation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than 90 percent of the aggregated emissions of each of seven specific hazardous air pollutants (HAP) enumerated in the CAA. On December 16, 2014, the EPA published the proposed determination that stated the basis for the agency's conclusion that it completed this obligation in February of 2011 by identifying the promulgated standards that collectively satisfy this obligation and provided the public an opportunity to comment on the EPA's determination. This action finalizes the EPA's determination., 223709=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the receipt of a complete petition requesting that the EPA add the chemical n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) (Chemical Abstract Service No. 106-94-5) to the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) contained in section 112(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). On October 28, 2010 and November 28, 2012, the Halogenated Solvent Industry Alliance (HSIA) submitted a petition to list nPB as a HAP and a supplement to the petition, respectively. In addition, on November 24, 2011, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitted a petition to add nPB to the HAP list. We have determined that these petitions are complete for purposes of this process, which means they provide sufficient information to assess the human health impacts on people living in the vicinity of facilities emitting nPB. Today's document initiates our comprehensive technical review phase of the petition process. The EPA invites the public to comment on these petitions and to provide additional data, beyond what are in these petitions, on sources, emissions, exposure, health effects and environmental impacts associated with nPB that may be relevant to our technical review. These petitions and supporting information are available through Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0471. Following completion of the technical review phase that is initiated by today's notice and runs through the EPA's evaluation of all the comments received, the EPA will decide whether to grant or deny the petitions., 28550=On February 24, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule approving the updated delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources) to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 288181=On November 7, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production source categories and to new source performance standards for several phosphate processing categories. The EPA is extending the deadline for written comments on the proposed amendments by 30 days to January 21, 2015. The EPA received requests for an extension from The Fertilizer Institute, several phosphate facilities and a testing company that supports the industry. The Fertilizer Institute has requested the extension in order to allow more time to review the proposed rule and associated emissions data, risk assessment and technology review., 283025=In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes that it has completed its statutory obligation of the Clean Air Act to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than ninety percent of the aggregated emissions of each of the seven hazardous air pollutants enumerated in section 112(c)(6). This document explains the basis for the agency's conclusion that it completed this obligation in February of 2011, identifies the promulgated standards that collectively satisfy the obligation, and provides the public an opportunity to comment., 78817=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAPs promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between April 13, 2004 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is taking direct final action to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 212205=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to correct and clarify certain text of the final action titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units,Ã¢Â€? which was published in the Federal Register of Thursday, February 16, 2012.

On October 28, 2010 and November 28, 2012, the Halogenated Solvent Industry Alliance (HSIA) submitted a petition to list nPB as a HAP and a supplement to the petition, respectively. In addition, on November 24, 2011, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitted a petition to add nPB to the HAP list. We have determined that these petitions are complete for purposes of this process, which means they provide sufficient information to assess the human health impacts on people living in the vicinity of facilities emitting nPB. Today's document initiates our comprehensive technical review phase of the petition process. The EPA invites the public to comment on these petitions and to provide additional data, beyond what are in these petitions, on sources, emissions, exposure, health effects and environmental impacts associated with nPB that may be relevant to our technical review. These petitions and supporting information are available through Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0471. Following completion of the technical review phase that is initiated by today's notice and runs through the EPA's evaluation of all the comments received, the EPA will decide whether to grant or deny the petitions., 28550=On February 24, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule approving the updated delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources) to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 288181=On November 7, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing and Phosphate Fertilizer Production source categories and to new source performance standards for several phosphate processing categories.

On October 21, 2014, ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil) requested an AMEL under the CAA for its pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its' Olefins Plant in Baytown, Texas, and its' Plastics Plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. In this document, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting comment on all aspects of the AMEL requests and the resulting alternative operating conditions that are necessary to achieve a reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions required by various standards in 40 CFR parts 60, 61 and 63 that apply to emission sources controlled by these pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares. These standards point to the operating requirements for flares in the General Provisions to parts 60 and 63, respectively, to comply with the emission reduction requirements. Because pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares cannot meet the velocity requirements in these General Provisions, Dow and ExxonMobil are seeking an AMEL., 334713=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys ProductionÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 18 days., 298767=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys ProductionÃ¢Â€? is being extended an additional 11 days., 308217=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAP promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between May 25, 2005 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is providing notice proposing to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 250145=On February 1, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers (Area Source Boilers Rule). Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on five issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document. In this action, the EPA is also proposing a limited number of technical corrections and amendments to the final rule to correct inadvertent errors and to clarify some applicability and implementation issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue. The EPA is seeking comment only on the five issues being reconsidered, the proposed deletion of the affirmative defense and on the technical corrections and amendments described in the preceding paragraph. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule., 324518=On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) from the new and existing Portland cement manufacturing industry at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). Subsequently, the EPA has become aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and is, accordingly, proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule. In addition, the EPA plans to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense in the final technical correction rule., 8785=This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Ferroalloys Production source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). These final amendments include revisions to particulate matter (PM) standards for electric arc furnaces, metal oxygen refining processes, and crushing and screening operations, and expand and revise the requirements to control process fugitive emissions from furnace operations, tapping, casting, and other processes. We are also finalizing opacity limits, as proposed in 2014. However, regarding opacity monitoring, in lieu of Method 9, we are requiring monitoring with the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT). Furthermore, we are finalizing emissions standards for four previously unregulated hazardous air pollutants (HAP): Formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury (Hg) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Other requirements related to testing, monitoring, notification, recordkeeping, and reporting are included. This rule is health protective due to the revised emissions limits for the stacks and the requirement of enhanced fugitive emissions controls that will achieve significant reductions of process fugitive emissions, especially manganese., 388937=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the June 30, 2014, proposed Ã¢Â€ÂœPetroleum Refinery Sector Risk and Technology Review and New Source Performance StandardsÃ¢Â€? is being extended by 60 days., 362266=This action corrects our supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on October 6, 2014. In that action, there is an incorrect location for the public hearing. This document amends the public hearing location and the date the hearing will be held, if requested.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 44772 - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants 2015-07-27; vol. 80 # 143 - Monday, July 27, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

Immediate impacts are rather easy to determine because, typically, this is what we see in the news if it is big enough of an issue. Hopefully, the impact data does not come from first-hand experience, but in the case it is, executives should take action and learn from their mistakes. If there is no real-life experience with the impact, researching breach data will help using Internet sites such as DATALOSS db (http://datalossdb.org). Also, understanding the value of the data to the enterprise and its customers will aide in impact calculation. I think the latter impact analysis is more useful, but if the enterprise is unsure, then relying on breach data may be the only option. The following are a few sample discovery questions for business impact analysis: How is the enterprise affected by threat actions? Will we go out of business? Will we lose market share? If the data is deleted or manipulated, can it be recovered or restored? If the building is destroyed, do we have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities?
