Students are texted, e-mailed, and called about drills, false alarms, incidents, and any other security issue. Recently a new building is being built on campus and students are up to date with wind advisory issues and the overall construction. We are also quick to learn about any attacks in any area of Boston.', 'None.', 'Clubs are a great way to meet people at Berklee. We have all kinds of clubs ranging from music-related to politically-related. Based on your major, a club is designated to meet each week to help the student within that major, to introduce artists or have guest speakers on that topic. Berklee also has a wonderful LGBT club called BUGLE, a songwriting club, and many others. New clubs open each semester and Berklee is open to hearing new ideas.', 'None.', ""Every city is pretty expensive. But Boston is like a mini New York - just less organized in terms of streets. With the Berklee Card, students get great discounts for food at local restaurants which definitely helps since tuition can burn a hole in the pocket. But if you don't have a Berklee Card, look for local coupons or deals in Boston magazines, Berklee coupon books, and online. Discounts for Duck Tours, dining in experiences, and even local stores are all around."", ""Berklee is in the center of a very busy South End Boston area. Fenway park is nearby, as well as Kenmore Square, Newbury Street, the beautiful Commonwealth Avenue, the shops on Boylston Street, etc. If you want to catch a game, head on over to Fenway to watch the Red Sox, or take the green line T to Government Center to watch the Celtics or the Bruins. If you're into shopping, Newbury Street is like the Rodeo Drive of Boston. Some of the best stores, restaurants, hair salons, and underground clothing shops are living on that street. Check out places like Charlie's Steakhouse, Trident Bookstore, Newbury Comics, Johnny Cupcakes, Kashmir Indian Restaurant, Bostone Pizza, and Upper Crust Pizza - to name a few. The Prudential Center sits on Boylston street, just across from the biggest Apple Store in America. The Pru is a gorgeous mall with great restaurants like PF Changs, The Cheesecake Factory, and California Pizza Kitchen. You can also book Duck Tours at the Pru for a fun way to tour Boston. Boylston Street also has great restaurants on it. Definitely check out Chili Duck for some great Thai food. Kenmore Square and Coolidge Corner both have really great theaters. Regal Theater at Kenmore Square houses well-known films while Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline houses Indie films and underground documentaries. Also, Berklee has many shows for local artists, students, and touring artists at the Berklee Performance Center and the Red Room at Cafe 939 on Boylston. The options are endless in a city like Boston. You can go exploring and find something new to do every day."", 'Berklee has become more advanced when it comes to food and dining. The cafeteria has been renovated and changed quite a bit and is open pretty much all day for the students. The Berklee Card is an add-money system that you can use at the cafeteria with a meal plan or at the neighboring restaurants and coffee shops. Berklee is currently adding more and more restaurants to accept the Berklee card, and with an easy and functional online way to add money, this card is great for any student.', 'Although every student experiences dorm life differently, it sometimes has more downs than ups. The cost of living on campus is high and because of the possibility of a roommate playing an instrument, like guitar or drums, could be stressful. Living off-campus is recommended, and it is rather easy to find cheap apartments around the beautiful Boston and Berklee campus area. Off-campus living is suggested strongly.', 'Some classes are of course harder than others, but every class relates to the other. Classes like counterpoint and tonal harmony will prove to be challenging, but Berklee does a good job of starting students off on easier levels and working them up to these more complex classes. Harmony 1-4 and Ear Training 1-4 are vital, and as the title suggests they do get more time consuming as the levels progress. Students should dedicate their time to picking up as much as possible in these levels and use these lessons for other familiar classes, like conducting or sight-reading.', 'It is important for students to take this school seriously and not treat it as just an easy-out art school. Selecting a major and discovering what you want to do with music are two critical aspects of joining this institution. Be sure to follow the outlines on recommended classes to take each semester, attend class regularly, and put your best effort forward. No matter what, never be afraid to seek help and/or guidance. This school has wonderful resources and very friendly people who are willing to help you succeed, as long as you are dedicated enough to do so.', 'Berklee is an incredibly eclectic school. The classes are taught by diverse and incredibly knowledgeable professors who are dedicated to music, the craft of music, the theory of music, and the technology behind music. With a wonderfully talented student body, Berklee is an inspirational, difficult, and rewarding place to attend college - especially if music is your passion.']]",Berklee College of Music Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Berklee-College-of-Music/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/49464,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,38,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00263-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,891566703,891511074,HORIZONTAL,"07/12/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 26 out of 29 people found this review useful. 1 of 61 Lynne from Suisun City, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You understand that music is a more universal and deeply understood language than any other."", 'Berklee is known for being unorthodox in its routines and patterns. One example is that you study music from day one. It does not take anytime to necessarily push prerequisites to the side. Music is involved from the very beginning and you learn it to your last day there, for four years.', 'Berklee is a music college. But that does not mean that they neglect the other areas of education. The college offers a rich core curriculum that keeps your writing polished and your reading sharp. For those who did not complete this in college, math, science and history are also offered in in-depth classes.', ""The Boston area has no shortage of activities. In terms of the college, there is a student activities center that is the place for games and the like. It's a great place to check out with friends."", 'I do not eat at the college.', 'I do not live on campus.', ""I am eager to learn. I attend every class at every opportunity and think of nothing else until it's over. My understanding of theory has expanded and will continue to expand. My musicianship as a drummer and pianist has improved noticeably over one semester here. The instruction is thorough and I have informed my instructor that I will not be hesitant to learn as much as I can."", ""Be prepared to work. Hard. Even before you audition, you better be putting the time in weekly. I'd say at least 5 hours a week for audition prep, and do not be afraid to do more. You need to decide what style best reprints your talents to exploit in your audition. Once you arrive, do not be fooled- while an acceptance to Berklee is a heavy one and an outstanding achievement, you will have wasted your time f you have not prepared yourself to have a great work ethic. Go to class. Do your homework. Practice. Play with others. Most of all, make sure you enjoy what you do."", ""Berklee immediately opens doors for the aspiring musician to connect and find opportunities to do what they love both on campus and off. When you're not enjoying the classes, you're likely hooking up to book time in a practice room to continue your passion and hone your craft daily. It is not as much a chore as a privilege, though you must work hard for it.""]]",Berklee College of Music Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Berklee-College-of-Music/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/49464,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,51,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00263-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,891566703,891511074,HORIZONTAL,"07/12/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 26 out of 29 people found this review useful. 1 of 61 Lynne from Suisun City, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It'll increase your all around musicianship and teach you more about the business side of music as well. Berklee offers everything a musician needs in the real world today! Tips for prospective students Practice hard and really impress them at your audition. That way you can get some money from them. It's really a lot of work, if you choose to do what you're given. But time management is key! Bang for the buck",True,0,0,"{42123=I attended the summer program in 2011. There was alot to it but everyone helped each other which made the program really fun. I hear the curriculum is rigorous but definitely worth the effort., 126940=The Berklee Beach is the area right in front of the 150 Mass Ave building where everybody who smokes, smokes. We call all of our buildings by their street address numbers like 150, 7, 1140, except for the building with the administration offices in it, that's the Uchida Building., 97566=Berklee doesn't really have any weird traditions and the campus is comprised of a handful of buildings within the Boston Back Bay area, so there aren't any particular locations of interest really. Although the 1140 Boylston St. building is the oldest and first Berklee building that existed., 275482=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 114094=Berklee College is a great place, but always remember to stay focus. May get really easy to get side track from your art form. Everyone is wonderful though, never a dull moment., 129531=I never lived in the dorms, and they are building new ones that will be ready in Fall 2013 I believe but the dorms aren't horrible. You get a mini fridge and you can bring in a microwave and they have practice rooms in the dorms and the ones in the 150 Mass Ave building don't have community bathrooms, they're all private ones in the rooms which is a plus!, 37392=i haven't experienced the dorm life yet but will in september., 7124=Don't decide to come to Berklee in April. You must decide well before that for several reasons. Take time to get the money you will need to attend. Also, spend much time getting ready for your audition. It's worth it.}",,

There isn't much to do in the town, but the UAB provides different performances for the students. In addition, the dorms organize different activities and projects for residents to take part in. Being in a small town also helps you focus on grades and join the many campus clubs and activities. Although there isn't much to do in Clarion, my friends and I have found ways to pass the time with sled riding, snowball fights, and going to the recreation center. ALF is also a big event for Clarion students."", 'I believe that I have learned a lot in my first semester at Clarion. The class sizes are small enough that you can ask questions and have personalized learning but also large enough to keep you from feeling singled out during discussions and activities. Classes teach you useful information that you can put toward your major and the teachers and faculty are friendly and respectful. Many professors are willing to spend extra time during office hours to meet with you and provide extra assistance. As long as you are willing to put forth effort, most professors will do their best to help you succeed.']]",Clarion University of Pennsylvania Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Clarion-University-of-Pennsylvania/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/50957,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00263-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,891653743,891587377,HORIZONTAL,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 14 people found this review useful. 1 of 83 Alex from Sandy Lake, PA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They offered me a scholarship right off the bat and considering all of the resources available on campus and the quality of education provided, Clarion is well worth the cost. Am enjoying being here I am from out-of-state, but I like being away from home and enjoying a whole new experience. I was homesick at first but the more involved I become the easier it became to be away from home. It's a little hard to meet people at first but it becomes a lot easier as the semester goes on. All of the clubs and programs at Clarion are great and there really is something available for everyone. Am learning a lot I love all of my classes. So far none of my classes have been too challenging, but you can still learn a lot. The small class sizes make it really easy to interact with other students and the professors.

I would suggest only joining a few and then really get involved with those few. If you're interested in any clubs, I think you can actually look them up on the website...there's an English club, a Bios club, Outdoor club just to name a few off the top of my head. You do actually have to get out of your room and go to meetings, but it is worth it. Of course, meetings can conflict with class times, but that's just something you learn to work around."", ""Students that like a small-town feel. Main street is quaint and beautiful. It's also great for students that like to be hands-on and get to know their professors.

It's great for a family feel, I feel connected when I'm here."", ""There doesn't look like a lot at first, but there are plenty of small places that you can go to around town. Clarion is in walking distance, I go there all the time with my friends. There are neat little antique shops and an adorable cafe. The university will host any number of events, most of them smaller. There is something every weekend, sometimes even a comedian or a low-key celebrity. There are also things to do within about an hour's driving distance if you have the inclination. I've been to a drive-in theater and a flea market. You just have to dig around a bit."", ""There isn't a wide variety as far as dining halls go. There's an all you can eat cafeteria, and then a small food court area. Most of the time the food is pretty good and you get a variety in both places. Sometimes, though, the food isn't the tastiest, but it is cafeteria food. Meal plans aren't exactly flexible....you have to bend yourself to work with the system every once in a while. But on the whole, it really is quite decent."", ""The dorms are clean and the rooms are pretty spacious. Of course, they aren't huge, but they have plenty of room to live in and move around in. Some of the buildings are older, and so they don't have air conditioning. They are heated well in the winter, so no worries there. Depending on where you live, you usually have to share a bathroom with a floor, but they're kept pretty clean. RA's are usually fairly laid back and don't write you up for petty things. Plus, the hall council will usually sponsor some sort of even now and then so you're not bored out of your mind."", ""You definitely learn a lot, or at least I have in the past year. It's good to keep an open mind, and you can find professors that will help you with anything. Don't be afraid to approach them. There are plenty of classes offered that fit requirements and are also interesting. Each class is different because every professor is different, so there will be varying degrees of difficulty. As long as you put some kind of effort into the class, you can usually end on a good note.

The program is a joint program with California University or Pennsylvania and we end up graduating with two degrees, one from each school. The program is a lot of work, but in the end it will pay off. The instructors are phenomenal and will help you out if you need anything. Only a few students get admitted into the program (the sophomore class only has 6 students when 20 applied).

I loved taking these courses! I learned about philosophy and sociology in two different courses. Although those topics didn't necessarily interest me at first, the professors really made these classes quite enjoyable and I found out i was interested in most of what I learned in the classes. I also took a course called Exploring the Visual Arts during which we would travel to different museums every class and learn about the art in those museums. It was a great way to learn about art and at the same time get to explore New York which is my college campus!

Tips for prospective students If you love being in The Big Apple and you want to attend a small, private college that offers the best campus in the world, definitely consider Marymount Manhattan. Bang for the buck",True,0,0,"{16829=The food plan is excellent and if used correctly, can last a student all year without having to add money! Although, if students do run out of dining dollars on his or her account, you CAN add money to it via the school's website, which is helpful toward the end of the year. The off-campus dining is fresh, healthy, and extensive in range of items to order. There is a location near the 55th Street dorms as well as within walking distance of the school itself and the 1760 dorm location. Both locations are clean and offer the option to dine in or order out, which is always beneficial if the weather is nasty., 137916=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 17726=Living with strangers can be tricky. Most students are respectful and will understand living with up to six other people at 55th Street dorms or one or two others at the 1760 location has its challenges. There are also many rewards to living with others, including making new friends and having a support system away from home. Personally, I think the 55th Street dorms are worth every penny students pay to live in them. Having two bedrooms, a kitchenette, and a bathroom to share with a maximum of six other people as opposed to an entire floor of students is a perk that not many other colleges offer., 132547=I think the food is really good. There is a salad bar. There is vegan options and gluten free options. They have chefs cook the food for you so the food isn't sitting out all the time it's made fresh. You can get pizza, different wraps and sandwiches, different burgers, pasta. The food is pretty expensive though. There isn't a meal plan like other schools. You can get dining dollars up to like $2000 dollars to spend. If you don't have dining dollars you have to pay tax on the items. You can also use the dining dollars at the convenience store at the dorms. There is also a Starbucks in the school which is nice and you can use your dining dollars there too. There is also two different restaurants in the city that you can use your dining dollars too.}",,

This ANPR does not contemplate imposing these requirements on community banks. 2015-01-30; vol. 80 # 20",False,-1,0,,"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 22:12:17 GMT","{1728=Ã‚Â§ 1823 - Corporation monies, 2001=Ã‚Â§ 1819 - Corporate powers, 1914=Ã‚Â§ 1820 - Administration of Corporation, 973=Title 12 published on 2015-01-01, 3605=Title 12 published on 2015-01-01., 1814=Ã‚Â§ 1821 - Insurance Funds, 2209=Ã‚Â§ 1817 - Assessments, 2127=Ã‚Â§ 1818 - Termination of status as insured depository institution}"

The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 283025=In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes that it has completed its statutory obligation of the Clean Air Act to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than ninety percent of the aggregated emissions of each of the seven hazardous air pollutants enumerated in section 112(c)(6). This document explains the basis for the agency's conclusion that it completed this obligation in February of 2011, identifies the promulgated standards that collectively satisfy the obligation, and provides the public an opportunity to comment., 78817=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAPs promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between April 13, 2004 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is taking direct final action to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 212205=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to correct and clarify certain text of the final action titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units,Ã¢Â€? which was published in the Federal Register of Thursday, February 16, 2012. We are also proposing to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense for malfunction events in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 218229=On August 5, 2014, The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) requested an Alternative Means of Emission Limitation (AMEL) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) in order to operate pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its Propane Dehydrogenation Plant and its Light Hydrocarbons Plant at its Texas Operations site located in Freeport, Texas. On October 21, 2014, ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil) requested an AMEL under the CAA for its pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its' Olefins Plant in Baytown, Texas, and its' Plastics Plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. In this document, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting comment on all aspects of the AMEL requests and the resulting alternative operating conditions that are necessary to achieve a reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions required by various standards in 40 CFR parts 60, 61 and 63 that apply to emission sources controlled by these pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares. These standards point to the operating requirements for flares in the General Provisions to parts 60 and 63, respectively, to comply with the emission reduction requirements. Because pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares cannot meet the velocity requirements in these General Provisions, Dow and ExxonMobil are seeking an AMEL., 334713=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys ProductionÃ¢Â€? is being extended for 18 days., 298767=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the October 6, 2014, supplemental proposed rule titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ferroalloys ProductionÃ¢Â€? is being extended an additional 11 days., 308217=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAP promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between May 25, 2005 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is providing notice proposing to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 250145=On February 1, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Area Sources: Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers (Area Source Boilers Rule). Subsequently, the EPA received three petitions for reconsideration of the final rule. The EPA is announcing reconsideration of and requesting public comment on five issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document. In this action, the EPA is also proposing a limited number of technical corrections and amendments to the final rule to correct inadvertent errors and to clarify some applicability and implementation issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue. The EPA is seeking comment only on the five issues being reconsidered, the proposed deletion of the affirmative defense and on the technical corrections and amendments described in the preceding paragraph. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule., 324518=On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) from the new and existing Portland cement manufacturing industry at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). Subsequently, the EPA has become aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and is, accordingly, proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule. In addition, the EPA plans to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense in the final technical correction rule., 8785=This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Ferroalloys Production source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). These final amendments include revisions to particulate matter (PM) standards for electric arc furnaces, metal oxygen refining processes, and crushing and screening operations, and expand and revise the requirements to control process fugitive emissions from furnace operations, tapping, casting, and other processes. We are also finalizing opacity limits, as proposed in 2014. However, regarding opacity monitoring, in lieu of Method 9, we are requiring monitoring with the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT). Furthermore, we are finalizing emissions standards for four previously unregulated hazardous air pollutants (HAP): Formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury (Hg) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Other requirements related to testing, monitoring, notification, recordkeeping, and reporting are included. This rule is health protective due to the revised emissions limits for the stacks and the requirement of enhanced fugitive emissions controls that will achieve significant reductions of process fugitive emissions, especially manganese., 388937=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the period for providing public comments on the June 30, 2014, proposed Ã¢Â€ÂœPetroleum Refinery Sector Risk and Technology Review and New Source Performance StandardsÃ¢Â€? is being extended by 60 days., 362266=This action corrects our supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on October 6, 2014. In that action, there is an incorrect location for the public hearing. This document amends the public hearing location and the date the hearing will be held, if requested.}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 02:09:35 GMT",{1105=Title 40 published on 2014-07-01.}

Experiments will be done by three groups of four students, with three different experiments being done (by different groups) in any one lab period. Thus the first lab will also have a prelab (overview) for each experiment. Please be sure to bring your notebook and take good notes. Lab report due dates are given on the schedule (below). For the first three reports you will be allowed to turn in a draft report. You can see how you've done, then revise only the calculations, results, and conclusions of the report (if need be). Start work on lab reports well before they are due - these can not be done well at the last minute.

Senate candidates show a variety of patterns, depending on the size of the state and the wealth of its economic base. Candidates in states like New York, California and Texas may get most of their money from their constituents, while those in the most sparsely populated states may get nearly all their money from out of state. As a general rule, incumbents get more out-of-state money than challengers, a reflection of their status as members of Congress and the wider circles in which they travel. Challengers and newcomers are rarely well known outside their state, so their ability to raise funds beyond their district is more limited. ""No State"" means that there was no state listed on contribution report.

Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.

The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.
