"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""UTSA is a great school for students seeking a bachelor's degree from a local university but wish to attend a Tier 1 graduate school. Students graduating Cum Laude or higher often have aspirations of attending the University of Texas at Austin's graduate school. Many students use UTSA as a springboard for more schooling in the northeast (especially those pursuing careers in Law). It offers lots of opportunities for campus life, but it's not atypical of an average university. Overall, UTSA has a decent amount of activities, events and clubs in which social students will prosper. Academic students are the most prominent around campus, since they dominate classrooms as star pupils, TAs and SIs (Section Instructors). UTSA has a moderately-competitive academic atmosphere, but it becomes increasingly rough as less-studious people are dropped due to low GPAs. The Honors College is barely visible around the school but honors clubs are important figures in the university social structure. Students looking for a degree close to home, in this case Central Texas, will always feel at home at UTSA. As the college grows larger, UTSA will become more than a regional university and instead a nationally-recognized institution. However, that day is far away and for now the type of student seeking a good education close to home will feel the most comfortable."", ""Prospective students should not underestimate UTSA's academics. The school places people with GPAs below a 2.0 on probationary status. If no improvement has been made after a semester of being on academic probation, the student will get kicked out. This happens to a lot of freshmen; don't think it won't happen to you, because it can. Students often feel lonely at UTSA since clubs don't always flaunt themselves to incoming freshman. Go out there and be active in the community! If you can't afford to drive back and forth to campus, consider living on campus for a while. It's the best way to make new friends and become well-known around school. Also, avoid taking 12 hours every semester. UTSA's freshmen advisers encourage students to do this, but it's only supposed to be for your first semester. Take 15 hours during your spring semester. Taking 12 hours for every semester will result in a 5-year degree instead of the expected 4."", ""UTSA is a public school; that in and of itself means that the school gets significant funding from the State of Texas to lower tuition rates and provide very cheap services. Students have access to an award-winning recreational facility (dubbed The Rec), select free medical services, sprawling soccer fields, computer labs, and conference rooms. Tuition rates at UTSA are some of the lowest among 4-year colleges in the United States; admittedly, however, this is due in part to San Antonio's low inflation rate. It's a pain for me to have to dish out the kind of money required to attend a large tertiary institution like UTSA every semester, but it's well worth the cost. The university runs a large financial aid department which works with individuals (through counselors) to pay for the rather hefty bill any respectable college requires. I've been to their fiscal services and financial aid offices, both of which are bustling with people who are paid by the State of Texas to help you fund your college education. UTSA's professors accept relatively low salaries, so many are not top-level lecturers like you will find at Ivy League universities. Yet, most are truly dedicated to their discipline (from Anthropology to Astronomy), if inexperienced. It's not a question of how many services the university offers to its student body, but whether or not one can afford to pay what a respectable post-secondary school demands. UTSA works with you, sure, but it's important to realize that they can only go so far to help students finance their college years. If you can afford to attend UTSA, the price will be well worth its pain."", ""The University of Texas at San Antonio is a developing university, and its student body really does reflect that. UTSA has over 30,000 undergraduates and graduates, but you would never feel it. Most students come and go as they please, many having not ever engaged the school's clubs, fraternities, festivals or events. This has lead to the college being pejoratively labeled a commuter school by some. However, UTSA has an amazing and fun social scene if you are willing to stick around after classes are done. The student leaders put on an annual BestFest in commemoration of Dia de Los Muertos in the fall and Fiesta UTSA during the spring semester. Lots of students gather around at these times to take a break from the stresses of college life and enjoy the campus. Students are encouraged to check out these events during Freshman Orientation (which everyone must attend). Some newer traditions include the annual Party at the Paseo, which takes place during Fiesta, and Roadrunner Days. I personally enjoy every minute I'm at UTSA. Being involved in several clubs, such as Student Government, the Young Democrats, Green Society, French Club, Soccer and Theatre Club has only strengthened my ties to the school. Just putting yourself out there will garner so many organizations who would love to have you as their newest member. If you can motivate yourself to move to club meetings after class, you'll be welcome at UTSA's campus. It's very fun, albeit challenging at times, since so many potential members do not care for extracurricular involvement. I enjoy being involved in the scene, but it's obviously not for everyone."", ""Striking up a conversation with strangers about the University of Texas at San Antonio yields mixed results around the city. A common perception of some uninformed people is that UTSA is little better than a community college for San Antonio's north side. Unfortunately, that couldn't be farther from the truth. UTSA has begun seeking status as one of Texas' premiere universities, although much work still needs to be done. As such, its academics have followed suit. Professors encourage students to come to class every day, warning that those who do not rarely pass let alone achieve decent grades. Instructors often utilize the John Peace Library and various other systems around school (such as the computer labs, distance learning technologies and campus events) to engage student learning. Unfortunately, as a disadvantage to both the university and some unmotivated students, studying is often self-taught. Other pupils are often reluctant to form study groups or tutor anyone who isn't their friend. That being said, the professors are usually very friendly and willingly to work with whoever comes to their office hours. Overall, you will learn a lot at UTSA so long as you can do things on your own. Students and professors sometimes do reach out to help. I'm sure that, over time, the school will develop a much closer academic community.""]]",The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/The-University-of-Texas-at-San-Antonio/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,13,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00219-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900230307,900055252,HORIZONTAL,,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 71 people found this review useful. 2 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 274 Stephanie from san antonio, TX Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

students in sciences and mathematics will find that the university puts a lot of money and time into those programs, while liberal arts departments are often smaller (though the classics and philosophy professors are absolutely wonderful, as well).""]]",The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/The-University-of-Texas-at-San-Antonio/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,36,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00219-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900230307,900055252,HORIZONTAL,,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 71 people found this review useful. 2 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 274 Stephanie from san antonio, TX Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For starters, how great the college is! I love the size of the college, not so big but then again not so small. I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn. Lastly, i learned that in college you can never get behind, you have to be focused and willing to do better and never settle for less.

For starters, how great the college is! I love the size of the college, not so big but then again not so small. I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn.

A great environment to learn in., 146330=a lot of the more exciting options in san antonio are downtown, which requires a fifteen/twenty minute drive from the 1604 campus. (the 1604 campus is the main campus, but there is another utsa campus downtown. i believe that many of the poli-sci and architecture classes take place downtown.) the riverwalk, of course, is a major tourist attraction. it can be a bit expensive, but it's a lovely place to visit, especially if you've never seen it before. during the winter holiday season, the riverwalk is lined with lots of beautiful lights, and it is dyed green for st. patrick's day. it's a pretty festive area with lots of great bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. first friday (an event which, appropriately enough, occurs on the first friday of the month) is an opportunity to go downtown to look at various art and music events and, of course, bar-hop. san antonio has a city orchestra which plays on a somewhat regular basis throughout the year, and various theaters offer chances to watch plays and musicals. there are three alamo drafthouses in san antonio, movie theaters which play a mix of the old and the new and allow you to buy meals and alcohol from waitresses while actually watching the movies. the drafthouses regularly have theme nights, so if you're an anime-nut, a rocky horror picture show fan, or ... well ... any number of other things, you'll like these movie theaters. the arts scene in san antonio is booming, and there are lots of great galleries downtown. the mcnay museum of modern art is also a wonderful place to visit, and it has free admission on thursday afternoons/nights and on the first sunday of the month. the san antonio museum of art is also worth a glance, though not quite as impressive as the mcnay, and it also has times that offer free admission. closer to the 1604 campus are lots of great cafes and a few good bars, including the best jazz bar in san antonio, chango's havana club, and flying saucer, which has the best beer selection in town (hundreds of different kinds). for thrill seekers, the six flags fiesta texas amusement park is really right down the street, as is sea world. san antonio's most famous shopping center, la cantera, is also very close to the 1604 campus. for those who like a little country in their lives, the hill country is a short drive away, featuring lots of lovely towns with various food and agricultural festivals, knitting and quilting events, and general small-town charm. to sum it all up, san antonio might seem a bit more quieter than other major cities at first glance, but there is really quite a lot to do in the city. whether you're interested in sports, the arts, community service, or nights out on the town, there are lots of wonderful options. if you can't find something to do on friday night (or even on wednesday night), you probably just haven't looked hard enough., 983565=Currently transferring to UTSA, starting on Jan 13.

(the 1604 campus is the main campus, but there is another utsa campus downtown. i believe that many of the poli-sci and architecture classes take place downtown.) the riverwalk, of course, is a major tourist attraction. it can be a bit expensive, but it's a lovely place to visit, especially if you've never seen it before. during the winter holiday season, the riverwalk is lined with lots of beautiful lights, and it is dyed green for st. patrick's day. it's a pretty festive area with lots of great bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. first friday (an event which, appropriately enough, occurs on the first friday of the month) is an opportunity to go downtown to look at various art and music events and, of course, bar-hop. san antonio has a city orchestra which plays on a somewhat regular basis throughout the year, and various theaters offer chances to watch plays and musicals. there are three alamo drafthouses in san antonio, movie theaters which play a mix of the old and the new and allow you to buy meals and alcohol from waitresses while actually watching the movies. the drafthouses regularly have theme nights, so if you're an anime-nut, a rocky horror picture show fan, or ... well ... any number of other things, you'll like these movie theaters. the arts scene in san antonio is booming, and there are lots of great galleries downtown. the mcnay museum of modern art is also a wonderful place to visit, and it has free admission on thursday afternoons/nights and on the first sunday of the month. the san antonio museum of art is also worth a glance, though not quite as impressive as the mcnay, and it also has times that offer free admission. closer to the 1604 campus are lots of great cafes and a few good bars, including the best jazz bar in san antonio, chango's havana club, and flying saucer, which has the best beer selection in town (hundreds of different kinds). for thrill seekers, the six flags fiesta texas amusement park is really right down the street, as is sea world. san antonio's most famous shopping center, la cantera, is also very close to the 1604 campus. for those who like a little country in their lives, the hill country is a short drive away, featuring lots of lovely towns with various food and agricultural festivals, knitting and quilting events, and general small-town charm. to sum it all up, san antonio might seem a bit more quieter than other major cities at first glance, but there is really quite a lot to do in the city. whether you're interested in sports, the arts, community service, or nights out on the town, there are lots of wonderful options. if you can't find something to do on friday night (or even on wednesday night), you probably just haven't looked hard enough., 983565=Currently transferring to UTSA, starting on Jan 13.

Tips for prospective students You may think college is all fun and parties, it is but then if you do not know where your priorities lie, you can get bad grades thus might getting on probation. A good tip is to remain focused, do your work, never fall behind and study! Parties will always be here and there and fun is all around, just manage it all carefully. Bang for the buck Yes, money is always an issue no matter what college you attend. Still, the faculty of financial aid are willing to help you get the most of your aid and help you out with payments. Plus, make sure you save up some money, or a lot of money for books and housing, that includes food.

(the 1604 campus is the main campus, but there is another utsa campus downtown. i believe that many of the poli-sci and architecture classes take place downtown.) the riverwalk, of course, is a major tourist attraction. it can be a bit expensive, but it's a lovely place to visit, especially if you've never seen it before. during the winter holiday season, the riverwalk is lined with lots of beautiful lights, and it is dyed green for st. patrick's day. it's a pretty festive area with lots of great bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. first friday (an event which, appropriately enough, occurs on the first friday of the month) is an opportunity to go downtown to look at various art and music events and, of course, bar-hop. san antonio has a city orchestra which plays on a somewhat regular basis throughout the year, and various theaters offer chances to watch plays and musicals. there are three alamo drafthouses in san antonio, movie theaters which play a mix of the old and the new and allow you to buy meals and alcohol from waitresses while actually watching the movies. the drafthouses regularly have theme nights, so if you're an anime-nut, a rocky horror picture show fan, or ... well ... any number of other things, you'll like these movie theaters. the arts scene in san antonio is booming, and there are lots of great galleries downtown. the mcnay museum of modern art is also a wonderful place to visit, and it has free admission on thursday afternoons/nights and on the first sunday of the month. the san antonio museum of art is also worth a glance, though not quite as impressive as the mcnay, and it also has times that offer free admission. closer to the 1604 campus are lots of great cafes and a few good bars, including the best jazz bar in san antonio, chango's havana club, and flying saucer, which has the best beer selection in town (hundreds of different kinds). for thrill seekers, the six flags fiesta texas amusement park is really right down the street, as is sea world. san antonio's most famous shopping center, la cantera, is also very close to the 1604 campus. for those who like a little country in their lives, the hill country is a short drive away, featuring lots of lovely towns with various food and agricultural festivals, knitting and quilting events, and general small-town charm. to sum it all up, san antonio might seem a bit more quieter than other major cities at first glance, but there is really quite a lot to do in the city. whether you're interested in sports, the arts, community service, or nights out on the town, there are lots of wonderful options. if you can't find something to do on friday night (or even on wednesday night), you probably just haven't looked hard enough., 983565=Currently transferring to UTSA, starting on Jan 13.

I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn.

Am learning a lot What is there to learn about U.T.S.A. ? For starters, how great the college is! I love the size of the college, not so big but then again not so small. I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn. Lastly, i learned that in college you can never get behind, you have to be focused and willing to do better and never settle for less.

Housing was safe but it was extremely easy to enter Chisholm. There is a card reader at the door but if you wanted in, all you had to do was wait for someone to enter or leave. Chaparral and Laurel had magnetized gates that were unlocked only by the IDs of students that lived in the housing complex. UTSA cops frequently biked through the housing area and the cops in cars circled the parking lot frequently. Off campus there is an apartment complex known as The Outpost. There were two shootings my first semester and I stayed far away from it as possible. It was a popular place to live because you cannot have alcohol on campus nor can you throw loud parties. If you want to party, do not party at The Outpost.', 'I was not involved in Greek life but there is an active Greek community on campus. It is not a large part of campus life but they can often be found tabling in front of the Humanities building or near the Sombrillo.', 'There is a wide variety of clubs and activities to choose from and the Rec Center is always full of classes that range from martial arts to dancing. The activity that I absolutely fell in love with while at UTSA was quidditch. I was interested in it and attended practices and games but was not on the team because I knew I was transferring at the end of the year. The team has a great camaraderie and made it all the way to World Cup VI this year. This is a huge accomplishment because the team was created in the Fall semester of 2012. This group of people is filled with a combination of hard workers and laid back fun guys whose personalities blend wonderfully with each other. They take care of each other and have each otherÃƒÂ¢??s back. UTSA quidditch has become part of the world wide community of quidditch and I am fortunate enough to be able to say that I was there when it began. It is fun, a great way to meet people and a surprising form of exercise. Do not expect to gain the freshman fifteen if you are working out with this team. I HIGHLY recommend joining this team to any and all students at UTSA.', 'The campus is on the edge of San Antonio, meaning unless you are attending the downtown campus, you will have to drive or take the bus if you ever want to go downtown. Fear not, San Antonio does have interesting activities around campus. There are two huge outdoor shopping malls, La Cantera and The Rim, which are across from UTSA Main Campus. There are movie theaters and lots of restaurants in the malls. Fiesta Texas is also located across from UTSA. Most clubs are downtown but there is a country and western dance hall called Cowboys that is frequented by many UTSA students. The UTSA events are not broadcast very well but if you are able to find out about them, I recommend going. There is usually free food and entertainment. Depending on the dorm you stay in, there are activities that the RAs provide. Free food is provided at those as well. Chaparrel and Laurel are two of the housing areas. They have pool tables, ping pong tables and TVs in their activity houses. Chisholm Hall has an activity center that has ping pong tables, a personal movie theater and an indoor pool. There is fun to be had on campus, it is just a matter of looking for it.', 'There are several on campus dining areas. There is the Roadrunner CafÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â©, which is located near Chaparral Village and Chisholm Hall. It is a mixture of a buffet and cafeteria. Everyday there is a salad bar, hot soups, burgers, pizza, stir fry, sandwiches and a southern comfort section that offers pastas, meatloaf and many other comforting dishes. In the library there is a Starbucks, a Subway, Chikfila, sushi, pizza, and a salad bar. There is a cconveniencestore located next to the University Center as well as a dining area in the University Center. The UC dining area has a Taco Cabana, Panda Express, Burger King, Chilis and a Starbucks. If tired of the food offered on campus, many restaurants in the area will deliver. There is a taco stand with exceptional food by the Valero station off of Babcock. If all else fails, HEB and Walmart are close enough to campus that you could hitch a ride from a friend or ride the UTSA bus.', ""I enjoyed dorm life but it was not perfect. My friends were close by and within walking distance of each other. The RAs planned fun events that frequently included free food. Everyone in the dorm I stayed at had their own bedroom and only had to share bathrooms, living rooms and kitchens. I lived on the first floor so during the first semester there were noise problems because the people upstairs were very loud. To this day I cannot figure out what they were doing but late at night it would sound like they were throwing furniture at each other. Depending on the area in Chaparral or Laurel that you live in, you may be close to a main road, a parking lot or, in Chap's case, a swimming pool. Noise varies depending on what location you stay at. Chisholm is not a good dorm. I will be very honest. The doors to enter the building and the rooms inside are constantly slamming. People would smoke in the middle of the night and set off the fire alarm. The walls were thin and many things I did not want to hear were heard. I personally witnessed two people fight each other in Chisholm. Another concern of mine with Chisholm was the safety of its residents. It was extremely easy to enter Chisholm. There is a card reader at the door but if you wanted in, all you had to do was wait for someone to enter or leave. Chaparral and Laurel had magnetized gates that were unlocked only by the IDs of students that lived in the housing complex. UTSA cops frequently biked through the housing area and the cops in cars circled the parking lot frequently"", ""I had easy and hard classes. My hard classes were difficult because of the teachers, not the subject or amount of studying. Classes I should have done well in I received B's in because I did not take them as seriously as I should have. Always stay on top of homework and studying. Putting off assignments only makes the pile of what needs to be studied larger and increases the likelihood of an all nighter, which is more detrimental than beneficial."", ""UTSA was originally a commuter campus but dorms have been built on campus and a brand new set will be available this year (2013). Despite the obvious difference in prices, I would recommend to all new students to NOT live in Chisholm Hall. I visited often and there were problems that the other housing complexes did not have. Fights have broken out. The fire alarm would go off in the middle of the night because people would smoke in their dorms. Late at night residents would return to the hall and slam doors, yell, and be very discourteous. Chaparrel and Laurel did not have this problem because the dorms were more like apartments and everyone had their own room. Problems arose in Chisholm because rooms were shared and living space was tight. Use rate my professor when signing up for classes. It will save you a lot of heart ache once the semester starts. I did not use the website until after the semester had started and could not switch out of any classes because I had waited to check until after the drop date. Be cognizant of drop and withdrawal dates. If a class is hard, do not wait for it to get better. Go see a counselor and fix the problem. If you are unsatisfied with the help you are receiving from a counselor, visit again and try with other counselors. If this is does not work, seek the guidance of an upperclassman. As an incoming freshman or transfer student, there will be upperclassmen in your classes. Ask them or a professor you are close with for guidance. The website is also helpful. Determination and patience are key when searching for answers at UTSA. The fourth floor of the library is a great place to study. It is hardly ever crowded (except around exam time) and is usually quiet. Do not be afraid to contact the professor with questions. They have the answers. Sometimes you will find that certain professors are not helpful and cannot be bothered. If you find this to be your case, then the only answer I can give is to study harder in the class. That class has become a teach yourself class and the teacher is of no use. Khanacademy.org is a great resource for classes like that. Even if you have a good teacher it is still a great website. Teachers will have the entire semester planned out by the time you start school. Use the planners that the school provides and if planners are not provided then buy one and write down every single thing in the teacher's itinerary. It is an easy way to keep up with homework, due dates and future tests. Do not procrastinate. Do not pull all nighters. Do not take a nap before a test. If you fall ill, visit the student health center. My experience with them was not good, as they were unable to diagnose me until the actual doctor visited. The doctor only visits once a week, all other days you will see a nurse. If possible, find a clinic or doctor near campus. It is good to have a doctor you can rely on in case there is an emergency. Go to class. Even if the teacher says notes are online, they will frequently mention things on a future test in class and will not put them in the online notes."", 'The University of Texas at San Antonio is currently the eighth most populated college in Texas and a feeder school to The University of Texas at Austin. Located on the outskirts of San Antonio, this school is known for its diversity and plethora of majors and degree plans.

Honestly, I think it's great because you don't have to worry about your personal belongings being stolen.

I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn. Lastly, i learned that in college you can never get behind, you have to be focused and willing to do better and never settle for less.

I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn. Lastly, i learned that in college you can never get behind, you have to be focused and willing to do better and never settle for less.

The team has a great camaraderie and made it all the way to World Cup VI this year. This is a huge accomplishment because the team was created in the Fall semester of 2012. This group of people is filled with a combination of hard workers and laid back fun guys whose personalities blend wonderfully with each other. They take care of each other and have each otherÃƒÂ¢??s back. UTSA quidditch has become part of the world wide community of quidditch and I am fortunate enough to be able to say that I was there when it began.

The only restaurant open the majority of the time is Starbucks. On weekends, close to nothing is available. The roadrunner cafe is also pretty decent. There are different stations such as a deli, a burrito line, pizza, a dessert station, and other things. The hours are good, and it's a great place to grab something quick or to pig out."", ""This is where UTSA might fall a little. The dorms themselves are nice, and the ability to walk onto campus is extremely convenient; however, they are extremely overpriced for what is received.

The laundry is service is also good, but make sure to get your clothes in before others because the machines are always in use.

I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn.

I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn.

The doors have not been windexed all semester, the bathrooms have hairballs in the corners of the floor and in the sinks, I have never even seen a janitor.', 'The professors spend more time googling their powerpoints than they do lecturing over them. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a race to see how many slides they can read directly from, rather than teach. If you fall behind you will then be directed to the next best reputable source of information, you guessed it, google. The good news is with all that self-educating going on the school makes double and even triple the money on students re-taking the same courses again and again. Many of my peers are taking core classes for the second and some third times. Lucky us, for only $5,000+ each semester we can make straight AÃƒÂ¢??s. (this is not including room and board, books, or a meal plan). So, now that we have discussed that professors do not have time to teach, letÃƒÂ¢??s talk about teaching assistants and SI leaders. If you have a science lab it will be taught by a TA. This TA is required for graduate school to teach regardless of their teaching or even social skills. Many will show up an hour after lab has begun, provide no information or help on the lab, and sit on the computer doing their homework. Not so bad, right? Well, when you are working with chemicals that can burn through your tennis shoes it would be helpful to have a source of guidance. SI leaders however, are undergrads who have taken the class previously, and provided you get a good one, can be helpful. They introduce themselves as follows: ÃƒÂ¢??Hi, my name is Jane, IÃƒÂ¢??m not your TA, IÃƒÂ¢??m not your tutor, IÃƒÂ¢??m not here for you to email questions to, but IÃƒÂ¢??ll hold study sessions for this class.ÃƒÂ¢?? (helpful huh?) Most teach you shortcuts to survive the class while not retaining any of the information covered. Again, this is fine if all you want to do is get by, but unfortunate for say a nursing student who will need this information to help save someones life, or an engineering student who wants to work on dangerous oil rig locations, even a graphic designer who wants to get and keep a job in this market.', 'Go somewhere else and get a quality education that will take you somewhere in life.', 'Waste of time and money. The professors have no interest in teaching, students take classes two and three times to get decent grades. The campus is poorly designed, and the room numbers make no sense.']]",The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/The-University-of-Texas-at-San-Antonio/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,269,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00219-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900230307,900055252,HORIZONTAL,,"07/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 71 people found this review useful. 2 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 274 Stephanie from san antonio, TX Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Am learning a lot What is there to learn about U.T.S.A. ? For starters, how great the college is! I love the size of the college, not so big but then again not so small. I learned that U.T.S.A. offers a variety of degrees from the Arts to Engineering majors. I have also learned that the people here at U.T.S.A. are here to help you, students are friendly and professors really want you to learn. Lastly, i learned that in college you can never get behind, you have to be focused and willing to do better and never settle for less.

(the 1604 campus is the main campus, but there is another utsa campus downtown. i believe that many of the poli-sci and architecture classes take place downtown.) the riverwalk, of course, is a major tourist attraction. it can be a bit expensive, but it's a lovely place to visit, especially if you've never seen it before. during the winter holiday season, the riverwalk is lined with lots of beautiful lights, and it is dyed green for st. patrick's day. it's a pretty festive area with lots of great bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. first friday (an event which, appropriately enough, occurs on the first friday of the month) is an opportunity to go downtown to look at various art and music events and, of course, bar-hop. san antonio has a city orchestra which plays on a somewhat regular basis throughout the year, and various theaters offer chances to watch plays and musicals. there are three alamo drafthouses in san antonio, movie theaters which play a mix of the old and the new and allow you to buy meals and alcohol from waitresses while actually watching the movies. the drafthouses regularly have theme nights, so if you're an anime-nut, a rocky horror picture show fan, or ... well ... any number of other things, you'll like these movie theaters. the arts scene in san antonio is booming, and there are lots of great galleries downtown. the mcnay museum of modern art is also a wonderful place to visit, and it has free admission on thursday afternoons/nights and on the first sunday of the month. the san antonio museum of art is also worth a glance, though not quite as impressive as the mcnay, and it also has times that offer free admission. closer to the 1604 campus are lots of great cafes and a few good bars, including the best jazz bar in san antonio, chango's havana club, and flying saucer, which has the best beer selection in town (hundreds of different kinds). for thrill seekers, the six flags fiesta texas amusement park is really right down the street, as is sea world. san antonio's most famous shopping center, la cantera, is also very close to the 1604 campus. for those who like a little country in their lives, the hill country is a short drive away, featuring lots of lovely towns with various food and agricultural festivals, knitting and quilting events, and general small-town charm. to sum it all up, san antonio might seem a bit more quieter than other major cities at first glance, but there is really quite a lot to do in the city. whether you're interested in sports, the arts, community service, or nights out on the town, there are lots of wonderful options. if you can't find something to do on friday night (or even on wednesday night), you probably just haven't looked hard enough., 983565=Currently transferring to UTSA, starting on Jan 13.

But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€?

Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€??

In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

These airplanes will have novel or unusual design features when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. These design features are electrical and electronic systems that perform critical functions, the loss of which could be catastrophic to the airplane. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for these design features. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. 80 FR 30134 - Special Conditions: Bombardier Aerospace, Models BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11; Electronic Flight Control System: Lateral-Directional and Longitudinal Stability and Low-Energy Awareness GPO FDSys XML |",True,0,0,"{68718=The FAA is correcting the final rule, Ã¢Â€ÂœHarmonization of Airworthiness StandardsÃ¢Â€Â”Gust and Maneuver Load RequirementsÃ¢Â€?

The NIEHS Conference grant program is considered an integral part of the overall mission of the Institute; thus it is critical that all conference grant applications have a direct relationship to advancing the mission of NIEHS. In order to be responsive, all conference grant proposals must focus on or clearly indicate relevance to advancing our understanding of the role of environment and/or gene-environment interactions in disease/dysfunction. This includes environmental science and engineering proposals, such as the following: methodologies to detect hazardous substances in the environment; and basic biological, chemical, and physical methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances.Ã‚Â ",True,0,0,"{7355=A letter requesting permission (LRP) to submit a conference application is required and must be received via email no later than six (6) weeks prior to the selected receipt date. The application receipt dates for conference grants are April 12, August 12, and December 12. All conference applications now must undergo a second level review by the Advisory Council of the funding institute. This is a change in procedure instituted under the most recent NIH reauthorization bill. In addition, NIH policy requires conference grants to be funded prior to the start of the conference. Therefore additional time is required between receipt of application and conference start dates.

In the midst of meaning making in every student written/teacher directed drama that I initiate, I question what our collaborations really are? Are they authentic voice(s) of students or the mimicry and manipulation of their teacher? Creating theatre is a complex and multi-dimensional activity. The voices heard on the stage are a messy mixture of spin off ideas, inspirations, and collaboration. Students come to their authentic voice and I learn to participate in collaborative theatre without my voice interfering with theirs. Drama education, for both students and teachers, contributes to developing imagination, to increase flexibility and creativity. It creates energy to activate knowledge, to gain understanding and experience about the world. Researching this lived drama research experience activates cognition to explore new paths of being. Students are not passive recipients of knowledge and teachers cannot be satisfied with a simplistic, inactive understanding of collaborative work.

The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size. Formula: Total Overhead Cash Expense / Net Revenues', 'Operating Profit to Sales OPERATING PROFIT TO SALESOPERATING PROFIT TO SALES is a useful ratio when evaluating value of a firm. It discounts the effect of varying tax rates and benefits to give a more accurate indication of the return associated with the firm. Operating Profit (EBITDA) / Net Revenues.', 'Basic Earning Power BASIC EARNINGS POWERBASIC EARNINGS POWER (BEP) is useful for comparing firms in different tax situations and with different degrees of financial leverage. This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management. Formula: EBIT / Total Assets', 'Return on Assets (After-tax) RETURN ON ASSETS RETURN ON ASSETS (ROA) shows the after tax earnings of assets. Return on assets is an indicator of how profitable a company is. Use this ratio annually to compare a business performance to the industry norms: The higher the ratio the greater the return on assets.

Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital.

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.
