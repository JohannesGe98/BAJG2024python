I got an extra grant for the year for just explaining my situation to an aid counselor there. There are other scholarships available at the school. Just talk to any advisor in your major. Although I still have to pay out of pocket, I enjoy being here at DePaul, and I know I will not regret my decision in the long run.

Your meal plan rolls over after each quarter, but you will not get your money back if you have money left over in the spring. I like how they do have a bulk sale at the end of the spring quarter so you can spend your meal plan on food and drink in bulk, but in the end it's not worth it to have all that money. If you are a commuter, however, the food is really overpriced. I feel there could be more variety (like a Chinese place, not just the noodle bowls they have). The food is good, but after a while it can get a little boring. Commuter students should NOT shop in Etc. (a mini grocery store we have).

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West. The Loop Campus offers housing at the University Center (UC) which is shared by the DePaul students, Roosevelt University, Robert Morris University, and Columbia College. There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year.

For example business, majors typically have classes downtown so it's a lot of more commuting downtown and being in-between the big buildings. Science students typically have class in Lincoln park where the quad and the newly remodeled library is. The school is also on a quarter system so you do 30 weeks in a year taking typically 4 classes a quarter. The classes go fast so make sure to be on top of your game.

DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking.

I have taken 3 summer classes and found I am able to graduate almost 6 months early due to the University's flexible and accomodating class requirements. In three months I have been able to get a jump start on my education. Despite the larger classes, the professors provide ample time to get in touch. I feel like they are just as dedicated to my success as I am.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West.

There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year.

Aside from the classroom though, I'm learning a lot about myself, my friends, and different communities and lifestyles. Chicago is a great place for a classroom. There's always something more to learn, especially when you're in the city.

There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy., 127175=Right now, I am a college sophomore - a double major in Biology (Pre-med concentration) and Political Science. I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

The city is great, of course, and I have learned amazing lessons on navigating throughout the city which is definitely a great lesson to have.

In regards to DePaul directly, I guess the Ray has its fun times. There's always free workout classes available, or you an go shoot hoops or play ping pong/fooseball/shuffle board downstairs.

There are 2 main locations for dining with a meal plan card. The first is the Lincoln Park Student Center where students can go upstairs and choose from about 8 different diners to eat at. Also at the lower level of the student center is a coffee/breakfast/treat diner where one can eat at while surfing the web at the diner's computers. Students may also opt to use their meal plan at the Ray, the local fitness center with a high DePaul presence. The next option is to eat at the Loop campus in the DePaul Center.

In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

Despite the fact that non-science majors have no classes on Friday, the workload is intense during the week.

With the ten weeks, there is no time to slack or not read for a class. If you do, there is a strong chance of being overwhelmed and extremely stressed.', ""I would suggest that you consider DePaul for what it's worth. If you get a good scholarship here, as many students have, take advantage of it for general credits. However, it is not the typical university; where there are active clubs and sports and fan sections. Students go home often and while you might not have classes on Fridays, the work load is intense on the four days of class you have."", 'I think the trimesters are extremely difficult for students to keep up with.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West.

There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

My current employer was a graduate of DePaul looking to help out a fellow student. I highly recommend jumping into the city life head first and embracing all the networking available.

It is hard for me to get my head wrapped around the idea of paying 400/course for a required Liberal Arts course that does not apply to my major.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion.

The dorms also put things together for those that live within them to attend shows and movies. There is always something to do or find.', ""DePaul doesn't have many options when it comes to avoiding the freshman 15, there is a salad bar, and sandwiches and thats about it when it comes to trying to eat healthy. If you're not into that then you are in luck, each section serves different forms of food. You have the fast food, pizza, pasta, mexican, and the corner that always changes each quarter. Student Center food isn't the best, but Brownstones will be your savor when it comes to breakfast and when the dinning hall decides to close at 6 pm and Brownstones is still open, their bagels and coffee are the way to go! For those that seem to find this all to be something they don't want, do not fear! ETC. is a tiny grocery store that has an okay choice considering its basically free with your meal plan. It offers the necessities to feed yourself when the dining hall isn't cutting it."", ""Living with someone else isn't the high point at DePaul, but the dorms prove to be social and some are the total opposite. It's really what you make of it. Seton and Corcoran were the most social dorms by far. The people there were so friendly and welcoming. Other dorms tended to be very clique and were harder to accommodate to. But non the less dorm life offers a lot at DePaul, the RAs lead many fun activities that occur throughout the city, you meet some of your best friends within the dorms and the ability to do so right across the hall is the best part of it. It may not seem like the best thing, but in the end, some of your best memories occur in those tiny jam packed rooms."", 'Within the 10 week periods you do have per class you are still required to work as hard as a semester. It feels like everything is due at once and you have midterms along with finals, but the professors do as much as they can to allow enough time for everyone to insure good grades for themselves. It is tough, but in the end, what you get out of each class is something that last with you much longer.', ""DePaul isn't your normal school, it is one however that you must be open to. The quarter system is something you will learn to love and hate, but it helps when it comes down to the amazing breaks you receive. The teachers do have little time with only 10 weeks to teach but they are some of the best teachers I have ever had the opportunity to learn from, and in those 10 weeks you will either want the class to be done already or never want to leave. DePaul is a college, a college of diverse students all with different backgrounds to share and learn from within the student community, it is welcoming and fun. The adventure doesn't just start and stop within the school, the availability of Chicago as your backyard is the key point DePaul has to offer and that is something you will always use."", 'DePaul is the most unique college experience one can ask for.

My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion.

There's also free escort service around campus at night- take advantage of it because the drivers are really nice. I've never felt threatened on campus or around the neighborhood but still make sure you travel in groups at night if you're straying from campus because the city can still be dangerous."", ""Lots of clubs and activities to join but a lot of students don't end up getting involved in them. There are fairs for clubs and activities at the start of every quarter so go to them to find out about all the different groups to join. There really is a group for everyone but it's up to you to take the initiative to find one."", ""Students who don't want the typical 'college experience'. Weekends (which for most students are 3 days) are usually spent exploring the city rather than on campus. If you're wanting a school that is going to challenge you but still gives you plenty of flexibility with your schedule and free time, this is the right place."", ""In between the library and the SAC there's an 'echo circle' and if you stand in the middle of it your voice echoes but no one else can hear it."", ""It's a bit pricey but if you take advantage of everything on campus it's worth it. Make sure you go to the events, use the free (and super nice) gym and take advantage of the tutors and the writing center. There are so many resources at your fingertips and if you use them it can help your grades, health and eventually help you to land internships. If you just go to class and go home, it isn't really worth it but if you take the time to get yourself involved with everything then it definitely is worth the money."", ""DePaul hosts a lot of events through its activities board but sometimes some events are more advertised than others. Follow DAB on twitter because that's how I heard about a lot of their activities. DAB gets a lot of cool people coming through to DePaul; this year I met Demetri Martin, Bob Odenkirk, four writers of the Daily Show and several others. Also, DePaul is in one of the best neighborhoods of Chicago. There is so much to explore and so many events to attend; there are always festivals on the weekends and cheap comedy shows (Thursday nights DePaul students put on a stand-up show called C4 and check out Baby Wants Candy- a musical comedy- on Friday nights). There are tons of thrift shops in Wicker Park and there's an Urban Outfitters Outlet 10 minutes near campus. Get an app on your phone called Belly to help you explore. It helps you build rewards to get free stuff at local restaurants and shops and sometimes gives free food or items to places you haven't been before."", ""Chartwell's tries very hard but the menu hardly changes throughout the year so you end up eating the same meals all the time. It also is very unhealthy and a lot of students (including myself) have spent a lot of money on Pepto Bismol throughout the year. By the end of the year I was buying boxes of cereal (which are $10, by the way) just to avoid the greasy, nasty food. Do not fool yourself into thinking you're going to need a big meal plan because most people end up having to do bulk buy at the end of the year to spend the rest of their meal plan money."", ""Dorm life is a lot of fun though I've heard that it depends on the dorm you are in. I lucked out and had a very social dorm and that's how I got to know a lot of my friends. Other people I have talked to have said that their dorm is the complete opposite and some didn't even know their neighbors. It's good to be social and get to know everyone at the beginning of the year because by second quarter most people will most likely have gotten into some sort of routine and it's harder (but not impossible) to break into that. Also, get to know your RA. A lot of issues might come up with your roommate that you might not anticipate (it's pretty difficult to live with someone you hardly know and get along perfectly) and being friendly with your RA makes it easier to go to them for help. The RA's also decide what floor and dorm activities to host so you can always suggest things to them and they might make it happen. DePaul's roommate switching process is also very easy so if you really don't like your roommate, it isn't hard to switch. I know people who have traded roommates for things like totally different bedtimes, one thought the other was nice but too loud and another left his room because his roommates were just a little too antisocial. People switch all the time, so don't worry if it happens to you."", ""Freshman year has a lot of required classes that are pretty easy as long as you pay attention and actually go to them. The quarter system is great because if you don't like a class you only have to deal with it for 10 weeks and then you move on to something else. This also means that it moves a lot faster and you have finals 3 times a year which is no fun. Some majors are obviously a lot more difficult than others- the business students and science students usually have the heavier workload while music and theater students have a much busier schedule. But if you budget your time wisely everything should be pretty easy."", ""Live on campus your first year! It's a great way to meet new people and there are tons of free events through the dorms; there are movie nights and outings all the time. Also, make sure to join some sort of activity at the beginning even if you decide not to keep going to meetings because it can be hard to meet new people at DePaul. Lastly, look around and take advantage of what the campus has to offer. The activities office has discount movie tickets, the sporting events are all free and there are many departments that offer free tutoring."", ""DePaul is a really great school that has many opportunities available to you so make sure you take advantage of them. It's kind of rough with the quarter system because you're on a different schedule than most of your friends back home but it also means you get to take a lot more exciting classes. Professors here are hit or miss; some of them have been absolutely amazing and some are just a waste of time and money (so be sure to check ratemyprofessor.com).""]]",DePaul University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/DePaul-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/87186,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,154,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00286-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905164815,905007463,HORIZONTAL,,"{19386=Many people in the other reviews have mentioned this, so I will keep it short.

There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy., 127175=Right now, I am a college sophomore - a double major in Biology (Pre-med concentration) and Political Science. I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West.

There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

There have been multiple incidences of battery, robbery, and the like. However, take comfort in the fact that Lincoln Park is one of the safest neighborhoods in Chicago. Also, DePaul's security and public safety is top notch so you definitely do feel safer being around Lincoln Park. Bottom line is- be street smart. Go to parties with your friends and come back with your friends. Don't walk around aimlessly at 3 am. Be attentive to your surroundings."", ""Being part of a sorority or fraternity isn't that much of a big deal here. Meaning you won't miss out on anything huge. If that's the thing for you and you really want to be in a sorority- then by all means, go for it! Otherwise, don't feel too pressured to join anything you really don't want to. That being said, there are so many sororities and fraternities to choose from at DePaul so if you'd like to join one, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for here!"", ""There is literally a club for everything at DePaul... except maybe sky-diving. But honestly, there is probably a club for anything you could possibly think of! And it's so much fun to be part of clubs, it's a really great way to make friends and get connected. This is probably one of the best things about DePaul."", ""DePaul is awesome for people who are good at learning independently. Professors can't teach you everything in just 10 weeks, so you have to do a little bit of self-learning in order to succeed in the class. DePaul is also great for people who are enthusiastic and passionate. If you want to be surrounded by multiple people who love the same things you do and find clubs for all your passions- come to DePaul."", ""So many things to do for fun! You're in Chicago for goodness sake! First of all, there are a plethora of places to dine as well as drink. Don't limit yourself to downtown or Lincoln Park. Visit other neighborhoods and see what they have to offer. You'll be surprised by how many different things you can find in just one city. Also- every band/musician comes to Chicago! So download the songkick app and see when your favorites artists are touring! There's literally a concert every weekend. Just remember to be adventurous! Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone!"", ""If you're a first year student living on campus, you're required to have a meal plan meaning you eat pretty much every meal at the student center. The food isn't necessarily bad, but it does get tiring. Almost everyone complains about having a meal plan about 3 weeks into school. Also, if you don't watch what you eat, that freshman 15 will sneak up on you pretty fast. It's really easy to stay health conscious when you don't have that many healthy options. Choose your meals wisely."", ""Dorm life experience really depends on which dorm you'll be put into. I've heard that some buildings are more social than others. However, it really isn't an issue because you won't always necessarily make friends with the people in your building. Don't worry too much about it. As long as you have a good roommate situation, you should be fine. And if you don't- try to fix it as soon as possible. Each building is quite different from the next but generally speaking the dorms are average. Nothing special."", ""DePaul has a really wide range of students, so you will definitely have the kid who get straight A's in high school, and then the ones who weren't as lucky or studious. So I would say that DePaul aims to have its academic rigor be somewhere in the middle. It's definitely not an Ivy league, but you couldn't compare it to a community college either. It's really up to you what you make of your education here. The homework and assignments aren't too bad. Just keep track of due dates because those tend to sneak up pretty fast considering we are on the quarter system."", ""Always get to know your professors. They are all awesome people and are always willing to help you with anything they can. Don't be afraid to reach out and make friends outside of school. Go to different parties, different parts of the city and branch out! You're lucky to be living in one of the most liveliest cities in the world. Don't limit yourself to the college campus. Always look for financial aid opportunities. DePaul is generally really good about helping students out financially. Don't be afraid to ask questions and see what kind of money you can get."", 'DePaul has one of the greatest locations any college student could ask for. Being in the heart of the city is hands down the best part of going to school here.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

However, I can speak to the quality of the dining experience or lack there of at the University Center. The dishes are never clean, they keep delicate items (such as straws cups, and tops etc.) behind the counter where you can't get to them so they have to touch it to hand it to you...very unsanitary.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion.

We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

Because of it's location in Lincoln Park, the crime rate is significantly lower than other Chicago schools. DePaul's Public Safety also offers free rides around campus after 6pm, no matter how short the distance. I often take Public Safety home from my night classes just because I don't want to walk in the cold! There are also emergency call boxes located all over campus."", ""If you're looking for a Greek system without the pressure of living in a house or hazing, DePaul's Greek life is for you. Joining my sorority was the best decision I made at DePaul. There are your major sororities and fraternities (like Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Delta Gamma) but there are also lesser known ones that still have an immense amount of spirit. Each Greek organization has it's own vibe -- there's ones for the partiers, ones for the quirky, ones for the preps, etc. If you don't want to be in a fraternity or sorority that is based on drinking and prefers to focus on philanthropy, you'll definitely be able to find your home at DePaul."", ""DePaul is great for those interested in Theater Arts and Business. We have one of the highest ranking business schools in the country, and Chicago is a great place to be if you're interested in pursuing an acting or stage management career. As far as the sciences go, I wouldn't recommend DePaul as a first choice."", ""I feel as if I am paying a huge amount of money for a mediocre education. DePaul's scholarships and grants only paid for about 1/3 of the total cost, and I had to take out several loans. Many of the students here come from wealthy families, so the cost isn't important to them."", ""Because I am not 21 (and don't have a fake ID), I usually go downtown on the weekends to shop, visit interesting restaurants, or see the cliche Chicago landmarks. Most students head to the bars beginning Thursday nights. Sometimes I ride the L up to Loyola University to visit friends there."", 'There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy."", ""In my first two quarters, most of the papers I've had to write were 1/2-1 page long. Many students end up with straight A's because the teachers assign remedial homework and do not grade very hard. Also, many of my professors for the First-Year Program and liberal arts core do not have Doctorate degrees and preferred to be treated as a friend rather than a teacher. Classes are also only 4 days a week, but many people can fit their entire schedule into 2 days."", ""Make sure you check out other schools in the Chicago area, like Loyola and Roosevelt. If you can afford DePaul's ridiculous tuition and aren't academically driven, then this may be the school for you. The majority of students are very artsy and eccentric, so if you don't fit in then I would suggest joining a Greek organization. The bar scene is also huge at DePaul, so if you don't have a fake ID then you might struggle to find something to do on the weekends."", 'DePaul is a school dominated by theater students and other students in the arts.

DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field.

When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot.

I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter.

Each dorm has it's own group of people. UHall is known for being the social building full of freshman athletes.

A quarter system is essentially a 3 semesters, however each semester is only 10 weeks long, creating the quarter system. Students tend to flourish or fail in the 10 week system because each class time is vital and jam-packed with information. A plus side to this, is the quarter system leaves very little room for in-class assessment, meaning test dates and quizzes don't exists much. A combat to this is DePaul classes are very reflection and writing based. So, assessments are typically in essay formats to showcase an understanding of the material"", 'One major tip for prospective students, particularly the lower-income students is that much of the student body is from the privileged, upper-class. However, do not let this become a barrier. DePaul is unique in that it is an urban school driven by a pledge of service to the community. Students from all various economic classes within the world will experience a transformation when coming to DePaul. Keep your eyes open and judgement away.

This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others.

In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West. The Loop Campus offers housing at the University Center (UC) which is shared by the DePaul students, Roosevelt University, Robert Morris University, and Columbia College. There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year. This is far lower than the median for the whole state of Illinois, which is 35,000 a year.

Being in the city and having many of the alumni work in the city gives the school and its current students many connections. DePaul also has a great calendar system where the students get a full month's break from Thanksgiving until January, yet the courses still cover all the information needed., 6832=I have just recently transferred to DePaul University in June of this year. I have taken 3 summer classes and found I am able to graduate almost 6 months early due to the University's flexible and accomodating class requirements. In three months I have been able to get a jump start on my education. Despite the larger classes, the professors provide ample time to get in touch. I feel like they are just as dedicated to my success as I am., 785360=Know there are two campuses one downtown and the Lincoln Park area. For example business, majors typically have classes downtown so it's a lot of more commuting downtown and being in-between the big buildings. Science students typically have class in Lincoln park where the quad and the newly remodeled library is. The school is also on a quarter system so you do 30 weeks in a year taking typically 4 classes a quarter. The classes go fast so make sure to be on top of your game. We usually start around the second week in September have break from thanksgiving until the beginning of January, then a spring break at the end of march and start summer break in June.}","07/22/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 62 out of 63 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 194 Rebecca from Chicago, IL Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

But safety relies mostly on the students. If you're roaming around in Chicago at 3 am, all alone, then, yes, something might happen. But many of these things really depend on how much common sense the student has. DePaul also sends out text messages alerting students if anything happens in campus and provides many phone numbers to call if you feel like you're not safe."", ""There are hundreds of clubs and activities.

Also, there are museums and parks that are accessible within the city. Chicago itself is a very diverse city and there is every type of food, entertainment, activity for every type of person. It takes a little bit of exploring but the classes and the Chicago quarter course will help you.', ""The food from the school is like any other cafeteria food from a school. But there are many dining options outside of school that makes the situation better. Freshmen must keep in mind that if you are dorming, you have to have a meal plan for your first year. Even if you don't use up all the money on your plan, the leftover can roll into the next quarter which is pretty nice."", ""The dorm life varies depending on where you're staying and who happens to be dorming with you on that floor. But the RA (residence advisors) are there to help with any issues and you can always contact the school directly for any changes or special accommodations."", 'The academic system is in quarters and usually students will have classes 4 days of the week. This means the pace of the courses are pretty fast. Midterms and finals approach quickly but if you do your homework and put in the effort, the classes will be a breeze (in the sense that it will go very quickly, not necessarily easy).', ""As a business major, I would highly recommend DePaul to anyone who's pursuing or thinking of pursuing a career in the business field.

There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy., 127175=Right now, I am a college sophomore - a double major in Biology (Pre-med concentration) and Political Science. I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West.

There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good.

I like to pursue interests such as running marathons, weightlifting, reading and having a social life with friends and family. Going to Devry online has allowed me to finish my degree while not giving up the pursuits most important to me.', ""In my time at Devry I have been an online student so I will go from that perspective. Be prepared to get a lot of emails/calls in the beginning. The school wants to make sure you have your tuition paid, academic help secured, any feedback on your experience, etc. You'll learn over time what to pay attention to and what you can ignore (like the frequent surveys). Most importantly, make sure you are on top of your classes. At a physical campus you don't have a lot of work to do until an exam or paper is due. However, online requires you to stay on top of the work. You will be logging in to your classes at least 3-4 days per week to do discussion posts, read and submit assignments. Do not procrastinate!! The week runs from Monday-Sunday so I like to have my work done before the weekend just in case."", ""Well Devry is a little more expensive per credit hour. However, I feel the education is worth it and the school has a good name in the marketplace. In addition, the sessions are only 8 weeks, allowing one to move quickly toward their degree. As a transfer student, I would also like to add they were very accommodating with my previous credits and I didn't lose any credits. Yes you can get a degree for less money, but I feel the cost at Devry is worth it."", 'I have enjoyed my time at Devry. The material is enough to keep me busy and challenged, but not more than I can handle. All of my professors have been accessible to any help I may need. The sessions are only 8 weeks so they fly by quickly. I was debating between Devry and University of Phoenix. A friend of mine was an admissions counselor at both schools and strongly encouraged me to attend Devry. That was all I needed to hear.', ""Having been out of college for the last 8 years, I had some reservations about going back to finish my degree. I had gone through almost 2.5 years at the Ohio State University, one of the top universities in America. Attending Devry online was my best bet in terms of finishing my degree in the least amount of time. However I was somewhat nervous about the quality of the curriculum and professors. I am glad to say I made a good choice in terms of learning. The professors are almost all currently working in the field they are teaching in. They have a great deal of real world experience in the topics and bring this to the classroom. All textbooks being used are very recently published. Most importantly, I haven't noticed a difference in the quality of information being presented or a lack of material to be covered. I have enjoyed my time so far in this past year.""]]",DeVry University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/DeVry-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/24761,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,52,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00286-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905329679,905162833,HORIZONTAL,,"{337533=i have been attending devry university online since 2010 and i love it. from the enrollment counselors to the online instructors, they are stupendous. they have plenty of online resources to help you alone the way and the instructors are always a phone call/email away., 588054=DeVry has been my second home since 2009.
