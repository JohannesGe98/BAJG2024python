The goal is to create virtual directory structures, which give different views of the data, but without having redundant copies of the files themselves. The files are organized according to information gathered from the tags of files stored in subdirectories located under the 'base' directory, which bear the prefix _data in their name. Parallel virtual directory structures containing symbolic links to the actual files are created, which give different views of the same data. Each virtual directory stucture gives a view based on a particular attribute specified by the user. The _data directories themselves can be symbolic links to directories on other devices, and can have multiple levels of sub-directories within them holding the actual song files. After songanization, the BASE directory contains the following directories: (i) _data* --> All directories starting with _data contain the real data. (ii) _artist --> Contains the link structure on the basis of the artist tag. (iii) _genre --> Contains the link structure on the basis of the genre tag. (iv) _initial --> Contains the link structure on the basis of the initial. ... and more, depending on the switches passed to the script. Resources Since Songanizer is a shell script, a running shell is the first and foremost requirement. Preferably","Acknowledgement There have been a lot of people who have contributed towards the development of the project in ways other than contribution of code/text. The authors would like to acknowledge the work done by these group of good samaritans. They include the GNU Project for helping the development of free software, and particularly GNU Songanizer; Christian Grothoff for suggesting the use of GNU Libextractor to read the tag information; and Massimo Bassi for his help regarding 'long options support'.
