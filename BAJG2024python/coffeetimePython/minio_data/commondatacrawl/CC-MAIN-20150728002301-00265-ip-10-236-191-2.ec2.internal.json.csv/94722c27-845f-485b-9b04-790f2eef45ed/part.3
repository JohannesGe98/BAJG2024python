While it's not the most expensive school around, you will most likely need some sort of financial aid (loans or scholarships). The school does offer some scholarships, however since there are so many other students applying for these as well, the competition is pretty fierce. Also, the tuition has gone up each year, so that is something to consider when trying to figure out your budget for all four years of your undergraduate."", 'The Twin cities has a lot to offer just about every type of person. The U of M campus alone has several places where you can hang out. Dinkytown, which is right by campus, has a couple of really fun bars for those that are 21.

Downtown is just a couple minutes away, which offers tons of entertainment such as the new Twins baseball stadium, the many clubs and bars, or Stone Arch Park (a great outdoor place with some beautiful nature trails).', 'I am loving my classes and major. Even though the university is so large, I still get that small college experience due to the major I choose. There are quite a few liberal education requirements to fulfill, but if you play your cards right, some of these can actually be fulfilled with classes in your major. The professors really care about their students and are more than willing to help you in any way they can. If you put forth the effort to get to know a few professors, it can really benefit you. There are also a lot of resources to help you throughout your time at the U.

If you go in as Undecided you will be thrown into a program called ATS (Access to Success), which is run by the CLA college. It is an attempt to help students identify where their interests lie. They have an office, very helpful counselors and are resourceful. However I thought it was a WASTE of time and energy because as an ATS student, you were required to select a class from a list they provided (classes from different majors) as well as attend ATS' very own lecture and discussion. As a freshmen I had to attend a year of ATS' program. The first semester was a complete joke to me because the course revolved around understanding who you are and where your strengths lie. We also had to make a Digital Story about our first year. The second semester was much more interesting because it dealt with cultural differences and service work (we had to volunteer). I know that books for college are expensive, but in this case it was halfway through the first semester, then the coursebook finally arrived at the bookstore. I purchased a $96 coursebook filled with photocopied readings, that I barely used for the remainder of the course. The second semester called for a few more books (Late Homecomer, Apples and Enchiladas, Voices from the Streets, Dancing with Skeletons). However we barely finished the books and only digest a few parts for discussion. I strongly encourage prospective students to just pick a major and switch out later and not fall into this as I did."", ""I don't have a problem with my tuition, but due to budget cuts I won't be receiving the U Promise scholarship, which was awarded to students in financial need and covered the remainder of costs (only if students accepted the subed & unsubed loans). It helped a lot, but I will not be receiving it for my sophomore year, and probably the remainder of the year. I've also learned that anything from the University is very expensive.

After becoming involved regularly you do feel connected, get to know the group, and feel like a family.', 'People who want variety, choices, opportunities, like to meet others, wide range of class time, affordable, can choose or not to become involved.', 'As a Freshman I am not sure of any unusual traditions but it was fun to see all the frat and sorority houses decorated for homecoming. There is always the trading of certain items between waring football teams. One unusual tradition is when a person graduates they take a pair of shoes, tie them together, walk the bridge between East Bank and West Bank and then throw them over to get hung up in the trees. There are so many shoes hanging, you can see them better in the winter when the leaves are down.', 'The U is very affordable for a great education. The U is well respected and many employers look to the U for hiring.', 'Some of the sport teams offer free admission with your student ID. The U has many gyms which students will gather at to play pick-up games of volleyball or basketball.

It was just as long taking the campus connector to get to my classes as from my house, so I moved home. My advice, if you know of someone you would like to room with before you apply for housing then apply together. The Dorm does a great job of providing activities and providing the opportunity to meet other students.', 'I hope you like to read. At the U of M a student has to be disciplined to purchase the books and start reading! There is so much more reading than in High School, time management is key. You will think you have so much time to get the work done because you are not in 6 hour classes, but at the U for every hour of class time you need to plan at least 4-6 hours of self-study time.', 'As with any decision make sure you visit, talk to friends who are students at the U, get a feel for if you like the large setting or if you are a small college student. Some of the lecture hall classes will have 300-400 students but then will break down to smaller class sizes for study. You need to know yourself, are you a person who needs someone keeping you accountable, or are you self-motivated.', 'The U of M is a large campus with a lot to offer.

Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus!

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majorsÃƒÂ¢??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum.

It is a bit too expensive, especially the food (average of $8-10 per meal). The dorm was cleaned every morning by the staff, and every floor had a theme which was pretty neat. Ours was Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse first semester, and the second semester it was Miyazaki Films. The friends I met while at a dorm turned into some of my closest buddies, and two of the three people I am living with next semester are people I met there.', ""I am in the University Honors Program, so some of my classes are a bit more difficult that the normal versions. I am also taking classes to become a chemical engineer. Science classes can be especially tough, but I find that taking good notes on my own time is the best way to overcome that challenge. I don't always receive fantastic grades on tests, but the professors put up resources on their websites intended to help students improve, and I have benefited from them greatly. Overall, the classes are challenging, but if a student puts in the amount of work necessary for him or her to understand the material, he or she should find success."", ""Get active! It's hard to feel like just another number when there are so many things to do and people to meet. With all the clubs and groups painting advertisements on the walls of the Washington Avenue Bridge at the beginning of each year, any student should be able to find something that piques his or her interest, whether it be Engineers Without Borders, the Philippine Student Association, or even the Tall People Appreciation Club. Freshman year is an exciting time for most people, and the key to success is finding the balance between academics and having a social life. That balance helps reduce stress, and too many people get stressed out and their performance inevitably suffers. Overall, have a good time, remember to work hard, and good luck!"", ""The Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses are beautiful during all seasons with the possible exception of winter. The Minneapolis campus is large, but the walk to class is not too far, and there is a good campus bus system that takes students around/between these campuses for free. There are so many things to do, it's easy to get involved in ways that meet and expand my personal interests.""]]",University of Minnesota Twin Cities (U of M) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Minnesota-Twin-Cities/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/109388,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,87,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00265-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,915363439,915151842,HORIZONTAL,,"08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 73 people found this review useful. 1 of 267 Donald from Norwood, MN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly.

The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum.

I really wish I would've hung out with a friend on his or her typical day at school to see how far he or she had to walk/travel. It is a good school, but be aware of the inconveniences. I also had a part-time job off campus and it was a pain to take the bus to it. If you plan on not working and getting the whole college experience, this big campus could be your school.

I had many night classes last semester and I always saw police officers (well, they're not Minneapolis police, they work for the school, but you know) mostly near and around the bridge and in places where there is more traffic so that students can feel safe walking home. There is less security during the day, but you still see people watching out for students."", ""Gophers after dark is the safest on campus destination if you're looking to have fun. They play free movies, have games and different events every week. We had the Myth Busters come one evening and talk to us about their show. In every hall and in the student centers, you'll also see advertisements for whatever is going on on and off campus, sponsored by outside or University groups. There's never a dull moment if you're willing to look around."", ""The food is great, which surprised me. For dorm food, there is still a large variety of things you can choose to eat. You're not stuck with greasy food and no choice but to gain that Freshman 15. I, for example, lost weight eating dorm food. In a healthy way. There are salads and sandwich bars and lots of options from around the world. There'll be Chinese food one day and Mexican the next, but you always have the option of not eating those choices if they don't appeal to you. Pizza and burgers are always an option so if you do choose to go for those daily, it's all there for you."", ""Dorm life is great. The rooms are relatively small in Middlebrook Hall, (with the other halls having slightly bigger rooms) especially if you have a single, but you don't spend too much time in your room anyway. There are lounges for studying in every dorm- one on each floor in Middlebrook (since there are 12 floors) and a large one for the smaller dorms, i.e. Centennial, and the others on the Super Block. The Super Block is more accessible to classes on East bank, so if you're more towards mathematics, economics, english, science, etc. I'd recommend living there since most of your time will be spent on the east bank. Not to say that living in Middlebrook and being a science major is awful, but for some crossing the Mississippi every day is too much of a hassle."", ""Especially in the Honors program, you can expect teachers to have high expectations of their students. They do their best to teach and want to ensure their students to the best they can. Don't be afraid to ask for help, though. Teachers have tons of office hours and if you're shy about that, the TA's are more than happy to help being students still themselves."", ""Don't be afraid to check out all the school has to offer, and trust me, it's a LOT. I've been there for a year and I still haven't been in most of the buildings. Make sure you know that being in the Twin Cities means having to be in St. Paul once in a while. There are free Campus Connectors that take you from Minneapolis to St. Paul and it takes maybe 15-20 minutes to travel the entire route- from West bank to St. Paul but not many people know that coming in. As for clubs and extracurriculars: there are so many things out there, from Zombie Survival club to Bible Study to Contemporary Dance, you just have to look around and you'll find a place to fit in within seconds."", 'The campus is huge and very beautiful; crossing the Mississippi is a challenge but a great way to wake up before class. Everyone is extremely friendly and ready to help whenever you need it.

For CSE, the classes are difficult, but you always have office hours, your TAs, and your friends to help you. Regardless of your college, the classes range from fun to boring, like all are a huge amount of resources for those who are struggling with their academics.

Am learning a lot It is a huge change from high school, in my opinion, when it comes to how much you learn. College is more, you learn as much as you want, depending on how much time and effort you put into the class, but the professors all seem to want students to take the most out of your classes. In a huge school it is so easy to find a million opportunities, being able to take courses not offered at smaller schools, which gives you the best learning experience.

Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved!

Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way",True,0,0,"{350325=anything! you live in minneapolis/st paul. gophers football, basketball, hockey, wrestling, gymnastics, soccer, and many other sports are great options. for professional teams we have the 2011 wnba champions, the minnesota lynx, as well as our newest minnesota timberwolves attraction, ricky rubio. the minnesota vikings and minnesota twins also play in the heart of minneapolis. in addition to sports, there is an amazing music and theatre scene in the twin cities. with two world class orchestras in the minnesota orchestra (discounted tickets for students) and st paul chamber orchestra (free tickets for students), as well as many great modern music venues such as first avenue, the target center, station 4, and countless others, there is always music to be heard in minneapolis, the guthrie theatre company creates the best theatrical productions in the region, and the orpheum, pantages, and state theatres bring in fine touring productions. there is never a lack of new things to do here., 688902=The application process is very simple. However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majorsÃƒÂ¢??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus!

In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved!

Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus! Bang for the buck I would say, as all colleges, it is definitely pricey, but of all the schools I have visited and been to during the academic year, the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities offers so much more for your dollar.

However, it is quite expensive, especially for an out of state student. The University doesn't offer as many scholarships for out of state students, which is difficult, but their out of state tuition rate is lower than many of the other other schools I looked out."", ""There is plenty to do for fun. If you likes sports, except for football, men's basketball, men's hockey, and wrestling, admission to sporting events is free for U of M students. There are also multiple professional athletic teams and some have student nights where tickets are cheaper. Mall of America is a $2 light rail ride away. From West Bank, downtown is a ten minute bus ride away. Plus, on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays the student union shows free movies."", ""My dorm has pretty good food, so it's not a big deal for me. I've heard that some of the other residence halls don't have that great of food. For me, I don't like to cook, so it's not too bad eating my dining hall's food. There are also plenty of places to eat around campus that accept FlexDine, so if you don't want to eat dining hall food, you can always choose to eat elsewhere"", ""Dorms are dorms. They're not ideal, but they're not horrible. The dorm room I live in is pretty decently sized, so I'm not complaining. It's just something you have to get used to."", ""I'm in the honors program so I have to take harder classes as well as keep a 3.5 GPA, so I have to do quite a bit of studying and classwork. That being said, the University is a world renowned institution, so there really aren't many easy classes, so classes are difficult, but manageable."", ""1) Get involved early. There are hundreds of student clubs and organizations so there isn't an excuse for trying new things and meeting new people. I recommend this especially for students who are from out of state. 2) Do all of your homework. I know this seems like a no brainer, but trust me, it's important. Even if you took honors/AP/IB classes in high school, colleges classes are more difficult and demanding and require doing ALL of your homework, even if it's not for a grade, and a lot of studying. 3) Get to know your professors. Email them or visit them during their office hours if you have questions. Actually, you can stop by during their office hours if you want to talk about anything related to their class, their area of expertise, or their other classes. Getting to know your professors definitely helps you in your class."", 'It is a wonderful university that provides a hands-on experience for students despite its large enrollment.

I would recommend living in an LLC. Pioneer and Centennial, the other two dorms in the superblock which are not limited to freshmen, both have dining halls in them. Pioneer doesn't have air conditioning so some 90 degree days in the fall can be rough. Sandford is closest to Dinkytown, which gives it a lively culture.

College is more, you learn as much as you want, depending on how much time and effort you put into the class, but the professors all seem to want students to take the most out of your classes.

Nothing should go wrong if you remain vigilant about security.', 'Although I am not involved in Greek life at the U, I have heard good things. Many Greek houses are very close to campus and have very tight-knit communities.', ""The amount of organizations on this campus is astonishing.

It's that easy, and anyone can find a club for them."", 'Extroverts who put themselves out there, though introverts can also find the niche that they fit into.

I don't know if this is true, or whether or not it will take longer or shorter, but I decided not to find out for myself."", 'The school offers top-notch education with a city hub filled with opportunities and entertainment that will make your stay in Minnesota far more enjoyable than if you went to, say, Duluth for college.', 'There is a ton of stuff to do for fun on the campus. The Gopher Spot in Coffman Union provides billiards and bowling for reasonable prices, and many residence halls provide billiard or air hockey tables for recreation. Student organizations are also everywhere, and many of them provide a fun alternative to an otherwise boring Friday night. A favorite around campus is the free (relatively recent) movie showing in the Coffman Theater.', 'The food is acceptable, however I must admit that it is quite a bit overpriced for the typical diner such as me who does not eat any more than one plate of food. Also, the healthy options are somewhat lacking. Overall, though, the food plan is worth getting if not just for the convenience. The ambiance in the dining areas are comfortable enough to provide a pleasurable dining experience.', 'The dorms (specifically Comstock) are very clean, including the bathrooms, dining areas and lounging areas. There are a few very quiet places to do work in, and the living arrangements are quite excellent. I would say you get what you pay for. However, my only qualm is the heating during winter can be...excessive.

It can be easy to put off finding your place in the community, but the sooner you do the more enjoyable you will find your time here at the University of Minnesota. Also, make sure to keep up on your studying. Keeping a high GPA from the start is sure easier than building it up from one ruined semester.', 'This is a very big school, though it has many small communities that one can be a part of. It is the center of much city activity, and therefore a student has a lot of access to establishments for both work and play. It can be easy to get lost in the buzz, but once you find that niche to fit into, the college experience is both academically and personally rewarding.']]",University of Minnesota Twin Cities (U of M) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Minnesota-Twin-Cities/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/109388,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,169,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00265-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,915363439,915151842,HORIZONTAL,,"08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 73 people found this review useful. 1 of 267 Donald from Norwood, MN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Rooms are not grandly spacious, but living with a roommate can be a fun way to get to know somebody, and to learn about what qualities would make YOU a good roommate.', 'If you took Advanced Placement classes in high school, the academic rigor is similar. There is ALWAYS more you can get out of a class, and the more effort you invest into your classes, the more advantagous and intriguing they will be. Students are expected to analyze many reading texts, apply class concepts, articulate and synthesize their knowledge in essays and creative projects, and participate in stimulating topical discussions.', ""Get to know your professors! There are programs that allow you to take them to lunch (for free), and visiting their office hours shows interest and helps you start to learn about other opportunities, maybe in other departments or through the professor's connections. Professors are very involved in their classes and are delighted to get to know their students and help them as they explore their education. Utilize the opportunities for connection that are available--they are an invaluable resource and can help you clarify the trajectory of your career and enhance your college experience."", 'The University of Minnesota has a daunting enrollment of over 50,000 students, but the campus is much more community-oriented than that number implies. We see familiar students and friends regularly, and it is easy to develop relationships with your classmates and professors. There are many research opportunities here at the University, which is an asset because it allows you to be a part of the current studies that are most relevant to you.']]",University of Minnesota Twin Cities (U of M) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Minnesota-Twin-Cities/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/109388,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,175,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00265-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,915363439,915151842,HORIZONTAL,,"08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 70 out of 73 people found this review useful. 1 of 267 Donald from Norwood, MN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Bang for the buck I would say, as all colleges, it is definitely pricey, but of all the schools I have visited and been to during the academic year, the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities offers so much more for your dollar.

Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants.

Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second.

Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus!

You don't really need to fear being shot at but theft does happen in the city if you are not careful with your things. I have never felt unsafe at all on campus. I am a woman and I have walked alone at night and gone to a handful of wild frat parties and crazy sporting events without ever getting in to a situation where I had any reason to worry. Still, I took simple self-defense classes before freshmen year and I carry pepper spray. I recommend that to every woman starting college no matter where you go. I don't mean to be one of the people who claim it is the woman's responsibility to protect herself from rape, I believe that the focus should shift to teaching men not to rape and not victim blaming, but with the reality of the world as it currently exists, self defense is important to know. While I am on that subject, men, don't rape. Also, if you come to the U join the Consent is sexy club!"", 'Some sororities and fraternities are just how movies and tv portray them and one of the are just a bunch of friends living together doing fun group activities sometimes. You have to look for yourself. They are big time commitment, though. I never pledged and I made tons of great friends right when I started the U and I never struggle to find something to do.', 'Marching band is the bet but there opts seriously a club or everyone. Also, if you like sports bu your not really up to the D1 level, intramurals are great!', 'Anyone who cares about their education. This is a wonderful school!', 'The marching band has so many awesome traditions to you have to be apart of to know ;)', 'So inexpensive for the wonderful education you receive. It is officially a Public Ivy. Scholarships are great, I have no loans and I got all of my financial need taken care of through merit scholarships through the U. It is also very well connected, The U music program is well known as a very high level and exclusive program and through it I have gotten multiple prestigious summer internships that will help me so much after graduation.', ""Joining the marching band is the #1 thing to do for fun! Also, there is exploring the campus (it's huge) and all of the great free stuff there (clubs, art, the Mississippi, or the movies). There is always a party going on (not all of them are boozefests). Or, downtown Minneapolis is right next to the campus and Downtown Saint Paul is just a quick bus ride (or soon light rail ride) away and there is always great music and restaurants and stores and clubs and so many other awesome random things downtown. Honestly, one ofthe reasons I picked the U is because I love downtown Minneapolis."", ""The food is super good and it is so convinient that you can eat in your dorm's dining hall or in any of the other ones. Also, every meal plan comes with flex dine so you can eat at the Panda Express, Erberts and Gerberts, Starbucks, Caribou, Einstien Bros Bagels, Chick fil a, or any of the other places that I am forgetting. It is really nice!"", 'Dorm life is so much fun! Middlebrook is by far the best dorm. You get to know your hall so well and everyone is so nice and supportive,', 'The classes are very difficult, it so worth it. I have learned so much and even when I struggled at first, my professors were happy to help. In all of my time at the U I have never had busy work. Every single assignment and lecture and discussion taught me so much and I feel I have grown an unimaginable amount intellectually in only 3 years. The professors are all at the top of their field and so knowledgeable but also so passionate about their work and compassionate toward their students.', ""Apply early! Also, really study hard for our first ACT because retakes are expensive and stressful. I got a 34 on my fist try at the beginning of my Junior year and it took so much pressure off. Don't be that person who everyone knows has taken it 4 times and the highest score you have is a 23 (I have a friends who went through that). Also, try to branch out in your activites and work for leadership positions. I thought that All-State Orchestra, the National Honors Scoiety, and French Club President were y stand-outs, but I was told later that things like Dance Team Captain, Anti-Bully League VP. Marching Band Section Leader and Rank Lieutenant, and secondary lead in a musical were a really big help to my acceptance."", 'Choosing the U was the best decision I ever made; I was very close to picking Oberlin, but the U is so uh better. The programs are great, the campus is so, so beautiful, the classes are so helpful and exciting, the music program is incredible, the location is fun and useful, and, above all, the professors are so brilliant and passionate and helpful.

Doing laundry isn't a big deal, just find an odd time to do it, such as during the week day in the middle of the day, or super early in the morning. Sharing a bathroom is a pain because other people don't know how to clean up after themselves, so beware of that."", ""Of course everyone wants to see you succeed, but it's really up to you if you want to do the homework or not...it will just cost you a good grade.

College is more, you learn as much as you want, depending on how much time and effort you put into the class, but the professors all seem to want students to take the most out of your classes. In a huge school it is so easy to find a million opportunities, being able to take courses not offered at smaller schools, which gives you the best learning experience.

Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved!

Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation.

As of now, they have increased the police patrol and protection by almost double so there hasnt been any crime reports in the past month or so. The police do not care if you are underage and drunk. The only way you can get a minor is if you're either passed out on the sidewalk, walking alone stumbling or showing signs of intoxication, or throwing up on the sidewalk. Other than that, the police do not care that you've been drinking because they have a lot more serious problems to look for (robberies, drug dealers, ect.). They just want to make sure you can get home safely. Also, there is a Gopher Chauffeur that will pick you up from anywhere on campus and drop you off at your house free of charge.

The statewide ballot measure, which provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and called for the establishment of an entity to make grants and provide loans for stem cell research, research facilities, and other vital research opportunities. To date, the CIRM governing board has approved 206 research and facility grants totaling more than $554 million, making CIRM the largest source of funding for human stem cell research in the world. For more information, please visit www.cirm.ca.gov., 6093=Ã¢Â€ÂœSince CIRM began making grants in 2006, we have been steadily advancing a scientific strategic plan, through a combination of research, training and facility grants, that establishes California as one of the most comprehensive and robust stem cell research environments in the worldÃ¢Â€Âœ stated Robert N.

The statewide ballot measure, which provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and called for the establishment of an entity to make grants and provide loans for stem cell research, research facilities, and other vital research opportunities. To date, the CIRM governing board has approved 206 research and facility grants totaling more than $554 million, making CIRM the largest source of funding for human stem cell research in the world.

A single mipmap level of a 3D texture is likewise a layered image, where the number of layers is the depth of that particular mipmap level. Also, a mipmap level of a cubemap is a layered image. For cubemaps, you get exactly 6 layers, one for each face. And the order of the faces is the same as the order of the enumerators: A layered image, as previously defined, is an ordered sequence of images of a particular size. A number of different kinds of textures can be considered layered. Layered Images The parameters work mostly the same as with texture attachment. The renderbuffertargetÃ¢Â€Â‹ param must be GL_RENDERBUFFER. The renderbufferÃ¢Â€Â‹ parameter is the renderbuffer object's name.  void glFramebufferRenderbufferÃ¢Â€Â‹(GLenum targetÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLenum attachmentÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLenum renderbuffertargetÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLuint renderbufferÃ¢Â€Â‹); Once you have created a renderbuffer object and made storage for it (given a size and format), you can attach it to an FBO with this function:  Renderbuffers can also be attached to FBOs. Indeed, this is the only way to use them besides just creating the storage for them.    glFramebufferTexture3DÃ¢Â€Â‹, specifically for 3D textures. However, you shouldn't bother with it, as the TextureLayer function can do everything it can and more. Legacy","For cubemap arrays, the value that gl_LayerÃ¢Â€Â‹ represents is the layer-face index. Thus it is the face within a layer, ordered as above. So if you want to render to the 3rd layer, +z face, you would set gl_LayerÃ¢Â€Â‹ to (2 * 6) + 4, or 16. Each texture, when taken as a layered image, has a specific number of layers. For array and 3D textures, this is the depth of the texture. For cubemaps, this is always exactly 6 layers: one per face. Cubemap arrays have 6 * the number of layers, which is the number of layer-faces. To bind a texture as a layered image, use the following command:  void glFramebufferTextureÃ¢Â€Â‹(GLenum targetÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLenum attachmentÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLuint textureÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLint levelÃ¢Â€Â‹); The parameters have the same meaning as above. Indeed, this function can replace many of the uses for glFramebufferTexture1D, 2D, or LayerÃ¢Â€Â‹, as long as you do not intend to attach specific layers of array textures, cubemaps, or 3D textures as regular, non-layered images. If the textureÃ¢Â€Â‹ is one of these kinds of textures, then the given mipmap levelÃ¢Â€Â‹ will be attached as a layered image with the number of layers that the given texture has.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages. Formula: Total Long-Term Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Current-debt to Total Debt CURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBTCURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBT shows Current Liabilities as a percent of Total Debt.
