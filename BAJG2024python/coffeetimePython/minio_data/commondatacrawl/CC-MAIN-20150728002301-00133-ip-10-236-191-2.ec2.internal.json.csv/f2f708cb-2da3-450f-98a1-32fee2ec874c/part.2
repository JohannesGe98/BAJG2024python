Perks Alteration magic deals with Thaumaturgy -- the one branch of sorcery which deals with transmutation and transformation of matter and energy (and vice versa). Edit Page Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Last Edit: 3 years ago Alteration var baseUrl = ""\/wikis\/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim"";","Notes on Alteration Perks The Dual Casting perk boosts the duration of the various flesh spells but not their effect - the armor bonus conferred on the player remains the same. Certain high end mage items (e.g., a certain mask acquired during the College of Winterhold quests) are classified as armor. Wearing them negates the bonus from the Mage Armor perk (even if the spell is cast without the item equipped). Total Magic Resistance is capped at 85%. Depending on items one may reach this level without the Magic Resistance perk (although having the perk could free up enchantment slots for other beneficial effects). Alteration really shines at the Expert level with the fantastic Paralyze and Ebonyflesh spells. The Expert Alteration perk is potentially a very good investment. Dragonhide works differently than the rest of the 'flesh' line. Read the description, and keep in mind Master level spells have a long casting time, before investing in the Master Alteration perk.

Leveraging their 30+ years of experience, Jamis is able to craft Race driven performance with trickle down for the average rider as well.

Shifters a very vital as well, so it makes sense that Jamis selected the Shimano SLX M660 Rapid Fire plus 10 speed trigger shifters. All of these components work in conjunction with the Shimano Hollowtech II crankset. This Shimano 2x10 drivetrain saves weight while offering a more versatile gear set. A great suspension is what comprises a truly fantastic full suspension bike. The Jamis Dakar XCR Race is outfitted with Fox Racing Shox Fork and Rear shock. Fox has been an industry leader in suspension technology for many years. Fox has repeatedly set new standards for quality and how suspension works. The Fork is a Fox 32 FRL with a FIT damper. The fork features external rebound damping, lever actuated lock out, 32mm stanchions for increased stiffness, 15mm through axle, a tapered alloy steerer, and 100mm of travel. The Rear shock is a Fox Shox RP2 BV with boost valve. This rear shock boasts 100mm of travel and can take nearly anything you can throw at it.

As one of the Schools to Watch, LMS will become a model for other middle schools across the state and country. In June members of the Lebanon Middle School staff will be going to the National Schools to Watch Conference in Washington D.C., to make a presentation.

I cant believe I finished this book in less than one day, and I would absolutely LOVE to have The Dirt Part 2 sometime soon! I just picked this book up last night. I really liked Motley Crue's music over the years but was tired of alot of their antics, so I really didnt know if I wanted to read this book. All I can say is I wish I had bought it when it first came out. I stayed up all night and just finished the book. It was very well written. It was sad, happy, somber, tragic.... It really put you inside each of these guys, and let you see the world from their perspective. Everything is covered in this book, from Vince leaving/getting fired, to the record companies reaction to Corabi, to hanging out with Ratt, GNR, Aerosmith, Ozzy, to Mick and his illness, to Tommy and his jailtime, to Nikki and his long lost sister he never knew existed until New Tattoo, to Vince's touching story about losing his 4 year old daughter to cancer. I cant recommend this book any higher to anyone. If you ever wanted to see what living a Rock Star life was like, then read this book.

By the middle of the month, high KBDI values expanded across southern Arizona and New Mexico and persisted across most of Texas. KBDI values increased across the Gulf Coast and Southeast and stretched into the Tennessee Valley and the coastal Mid-Atlantic. On June 30th, the high KBDI values across the southern tier of the country persisted, and stretched further northward into the coastal Northeast. Precipitation across southern Texas and Florida lowered KBDI values there., 3867=According to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), during the month of June, dry conditions prevailed across the southern tier of the country, particularly the Southwest, Southern Plains, and along the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Atlantic coast. According to the USDM, the overall percent area of the contiguous U.S. experiencing drought (D1-D4) increased from 25.6 percent to 28.1 percent. The extent of each category of drought also increased. Most noteworthy, by the end of June, 11.9 percent of the country was experiencing exceptional drought, the most extreme drought category. During the month, no region of the contiguous U.S. experienced improvement in drought conditions. Across the Southwest, drought conditions worsened with extreme-to-exceptional drought spreading across southern Arizona and most of New Mexico. By the end of June, 47.3 percent of Texas was under exceptional drought conditions, which also stretched across western Oklahoma, and along the Gulf Coast into southern Georgia, and coastal Florida. On the 28th of June, 63.5 percent of Louisiana and 41.2 percent of Georgia were classified as in exceptional drought. Drought conditions also worsened across the coastal Mid-Atlantic, which has been dry for the past few months. During the month, the drought footprint across Hawaii remained unchanged, while the central and southern coastal regions of Alaska continued to experience abnormally dry conditions., 10041=Almost due south of the Wallow Fire, the Horseshoe 2 fire burned across southeastern Arizona. The fire began in Horseshoe Canyon on the Douglas Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest on May 8th. On June 29th, the fire was 100 percent contained after burning 222,954 acres (90,226 hectares). Several communities had to be evacuated including Cave Creek Canyon, Paradise, Whitetail Canyon, West Turkey Creek and West Pinery Canyon, where nine residences were destroyed. The Chiricahua National Monument was closed in early June and continued to be closed due to smoldering that was still occurring on June 30th. The fire grew rapidly out of control during May and June due to unprecedented dry fuel moistures, an abundance of fuel caused by a frost kill of oak this past winter, and strong erratic winds., 14717=According to the USFS Ã¢Â€Â“ Wildland Fire Assessment System, on June 1st, low 10-hour fuel moistures were present for most of the contiguous U.S., with the exception of New England and the Pacific Northwest. The driest 10-hour fuel moistures were centered across the Southwest and Southern Plains. Low 100-hour and 1,000-hour fuel moistures were observed across most of the Southwest and the Southern Plains. By the middle of June, precipitation across parts of the Midwest increased 10-hour fuel moistures there. Dry conditions persisted across the southern tier of the country, causing 10-hour fuel moistures to decrease across the Southeast, Southern Plains and Southwest. Very low 100-hour and 1,000-hour fuel moistures continued for the Southern Plains and the Southwest. On the 30th, low 10-hour fuel moistures were observed along the Eastern Sea Board, across the Great Lakes and the Gulf Coast. The lowest 10-hour fuel moistures continued to be reported across the Southern Plains and Southwest. Not much change was observed in the 100-hour and 1,000-hour fuel moistures, with continued dryness across the Southwest. Across Alaska, during June, dry 10-hour hour fuel moistures developed across the central and western parts of the state, while the 100-hour and 1,000-hour fuel moistures remained high., 6266=The Las Conchas Fire was ignited on June 26th in northern New Mexico near Los Alamos. On July 1st, the fire had consumed over 94,000 acres (38,040 hectares) and was only three percent contained. Given the forecasted weather conditions, the fire was expected to burn well into July. The fire surpassed the 94,000 acres burned by the 2003 Dry Lakes Fire as New MexicoÃ¢Â€Â™s largest fire on record. The fire was driven by strong winds and extremely dry fuels. The largest concern of the firefighters was the town of Los Alamos, home to the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s premier nuclear research facility. The fire encroached upon the grounds of the research facility several times, but fire crews were able to keep the flames from spreading. The lab, as well as the Bandelier National Monument, was closed and several cities nearby including Los Alamos, Cochiti Mesa, and Las Conchas were evacuated as a precaution. According to media reports, on the 28th, the blaze was said to be as close as 50 ft (15 m) away from the grounds of the lab, raising fears it could reach a cache of 30,000 drums, each containing 55 gallons (208 litres) of plutonium-contaminated waste. This prompted the Environmental Protection Agency to deploy air monitors and aircraft to monitor radiation levels. Over 1,200 crews from around the country were called in to battle the blaze., 2183=According to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), at the beginning of July, the nationwide number of fires year-to-date was 36,424 which burned approximately 4.8 million acres (1.9 million hectares), with an average of 132 acres (53.4 hectares) per fire. This marks the largest acreage burned for the January-June period since records began in 2000, suprassing the January-June 2006 period by more than 1.0 million acres (405,000 hectares). Conversely, the number of fires year-to-date was below average, marking the fourth smallest (ninth largest) on record. The relatively small number of fires compared to the acreage burned was associated with the large average fire size. During June, an estimated 1.35 million acres (0.55 million hectares) burned across the U.S., approximately 500,000 acres (202,342 hectares) above the 2000-2010 average. A total of 6,567 fires were reported during the month, which was below the 2000-2010 average of 8,387. The average number of acres burned per fire was 204.8 acres (82.9 hectares), which was the largest in the period of record and nearly twice the 2000-2010 average of 112.7 acres (45.6 hectares)., 11345=According to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Ã¢Â€Â“ Wildland Fire Assessment System, at the beginning of June, very high fire danger was occurring across the Southeast, Gulf Coast, and stretching into the Southern Plains. Extreme fire danger was occurring across the Southwest and the Great Basin. By the 15th, the same regions of the country continued to experience high-to-extreme fire danger. Very high fire danger also developed across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By the end of June, precipitation across the southeastern quadrant of the country ended the high fire danger there. Weather conditions continued to be dry across the Southern Plains and Southwest, where extreme fire danger developed across northern Texas and very high fire danger continued across the Southwest. Cool temperatures and light precipitation helped to alleviate the fire danger across the Great Basin., 8254=Two large wildfires ravaged parts of eastern Arizona during the month of June Ã¢Â€Â” the Wallow and Horseshoe 2 fires. Both wildfires were fueled by extremely dry conditions and strong winds and were ignited due to human activity. The Wallow fire, which was first reported on May 29th, burned 538,049 acres (217,740 hectares) by June 30th, and nearly 1,000 firefighting crews were called in to battle the blaze. The Wallow fire was the largest fire ever reported in the state of Arizona, surpassing the Rodeo-Chediski Fire by nearly 70,000 acres (28,328 hectares), which occurred in July 2002. By the end of June, the Wallow Fire had destroyed 32 homes and 40 additional structures, compared to the 900 structures destroyed by the Rodeo-Chediski Fire. The fire threatened several communities in eastern Arizona, forcing the evacuation of Sunrise, Greer, Blue River, Alpine, Nutrioso, Eager, and Springerville. The fire had far reaching impacts beyond Arizona, with the strong winds blowing the smoke as far away as the Great Lakes, creating poor air quality conditions from Arizona to Wisconsin. On June 30th, the fire was 95 percent contained.}","NIFC) 2011 Wildfire Statistics (Source: June 30 ] June 19 Ã‚Â |Ã‚Â  June 1 Ã‚Â |Ã‚Â  [ Large Fire Maps: During June, there were 6,567 fires which burned 1.3 million acres (526,000 hectares).

Ã‚Â“We wrestled very well at both Oconto Falls and at Shawano. In the Oconto Falls match, we only lost one contested match which is outstanding against a very good team. Our kids came ready to wrestle, so I was very proud of their performance. It was finally nice to have Derek Teteak and Jensyn Schaal back in the lineup after injuries,Ã‚Â” Coleman coach Kevin Casper said. After coming up on the short end for the past 5 years against Oconto Falls, the Coleman Cougars turned the tables Friday night with a dominating 60-18 non-conference win. Coleman claimed 11 of the 12 bouts wrestled with two forfeits. Coleman is the fourth ranked team in Division 3 and Oconto Falls 6th in D-2. Things got better on Saturday as five champions sparked the Cougars to a runner-up finish at Shawano.

ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â The Process as it would become known was never more evident than with what the Royals did during the 2008 draft when they transformed the system and the organization by taking big name prospects Eric Hosmer, Johnny Giavotella, Mike Montgomery and John Lamb. ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â Those names on the upper end combined with Tim Melville, Greg Billo and Blaine Hardy to bracket what has become the best draft in a top rated system.

ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â Both competitions could hold the key to AllenÃ¢Â€Â™s baseball future.}","CaldwellÃ¢Â€Â™s scouting report doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t read like your usual power throwing major league reliever but looking at his splits last year one can gleam a little hope into his future.

You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from historical results or those anticipated by such statements. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Corporation include, but are not limited to, changes in: collateral values, especially in the real estate market; continued challenging economic conditions or deterioration in general business and economic conditions and in the financial markets; the impact of any laws, regulations, policies or programs implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; branch expansion plans; interest rates; monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Ã¢Â€ÂœComptrollerÃ¢Â€?), the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; the economy of Northern Virginia, including governmental spending and commercial and residential real estate markets; the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; the liquidity of the Corporation; the impact that the closure of the Mortgage Production Branch has on the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s operating losses and profitability; and accounting principles, policies and guidelines.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made., 413918=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s unrealized loss on its mutual fund investment was caused by interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2013, this one security had an unrealized loss of $68,881. Based on the credit quality of the issuers, the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to hold this security until a market price recovery, and the determination that it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not be required to sell this security before its anticipated recovery, the Corporation does not consider this investment other than temporarily impaired., 1006441=It is the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s policy to recognize transfers between levels as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012., 664761=Loans are considered past due if a contractual payment is not made by the calendar day after the payment is due. However, for reporting purposes loans past due 1 to 29 days are excluded from loans past due and are included in the total for current loans in the table below. The delinquency status of the loans in the portfolio is shown below as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Loans that were on non-accrual status are not included in any past due amounts., 1184566=Net income for the second quarter of 2013 totaled $3.5 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2012. Earnings per diluted share were $0.34 for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $0.38 per diluted share in the same period of 2012. Net income continued to remain stable even with a $95.4 million decrease in loan origination volume for the three month period ended June 30, 2013 in comparison with the same period in 2012. This decreased volume as well as the rise in current interest rates led to the $7.6 million decrease in gain on sale of loans when comparing the three month period ending June 2013 to the same period ending June 2012. The decreased income on loans held for sale was favorably offset by a $1.5 million reduction in salaries and management fees related to the production of loans when comparing the three month period ended June 2013 to the same period in 2012. Also mitigating the impact of the reduced loan volume was the gain on hedging activity of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the $2.0 million loss for the same period in 2012. The growth in our loans held for investment portfolio as well as favorable changes in our deposit mix attributed to the increase in net interest income for the three month period ended June 30, 2013 of $320 thousand when compared to the same period in 2012. The reduction in the provision for loan loss as well as the income tax expense of $472 thousand and $673 thousand, respectively, further mitigated the impact of the reduced loan volume on net income., 935578=In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Ã¢Â€ÂœComprehensive Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeÃ¢Â€?. ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2013-02 are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2012, with prospective application to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance had no impact to the consolidated financial statements as the Corporation did not have any reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income during the first quarter 2013., 1044062=At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the majority of off-balance-sheet items are variable rate instruments or convert to variable rate instruments if drawn upon. Therefore, the fair value of these items is largely based on fees, which are nominal and immaterial., 1072861=Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Corporation generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. The Corporation had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $4.4 million and $6.4 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively., 596633=The profile of the loan portfolio, as indicated by risk rating, as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 is shown below., 1044493=The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 were as follows:, 423235=The following table presents the composition of the loans held for investment portfolio at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012:, 5958=(703) 871-2100, 1197635=The loan portfolio constitutes the largest component of earning assets and is comprised of commercial real estate Ã¢Â€Â“ owner occupied, commercial real estate Ã¢Â€Â“ non-owner occupied, residential real estate, commercial, real estate construction, and consumer loans. All lending activities of the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulations and supervision of the Comptroller. The loan portfolio does not have any pay option adjustable rate mortgages, loans with teaser rates or subprime loans or any other loans considered Ã¢Â€Âœhigh risk loansÃ¢Â€?. Loans totaled $641.5 million at June 30, 2013 compared to $617.0 million at December 31, 2012, an increase of $24.5 million. Comprising the majority of the growth, commercial loans increased $7.2 million, residential real estate loans increased $12.7 million and real estate construction loans increased $5.4 million. The overall increase in loans reflects a continued improvement in loan demand by local businesses, as seen through the increase in commercial segments of the loan portfolio, and is principally due to improvement in economic conditions in Northern Virginia. Please see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the composition of the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s loan portfolio. The following is a summary of the loan portfolio at June 30, 1173271=For additional discussion of risk factors that may cause our actual future results to differ materially from the results indicated within forward looking statements, please see Ã¢Â€ÂœItem 1A Ã¢Â€Â“ Risk FactorsÃ¢Â€? of the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012., 6704=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days. Yes x Ã‚Â No Ã‚Â¨, 1195797=At June 30, 2013 the fair value of the securities portfolio totaled $85.0 million, compared to $81.1 million at December 31, 2012. Included in the fair value totals are held-to-maturity securities with an amortized cost of $15.9 million (fair value of $15.5 million) and $45.0 million (fair value of $45.3 million) at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Securities classified as available-for-sale are accounted for at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded directly to a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of associated tax effect while held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities are used to provide liquidity, to generate income, and to temporarily supplement loan growth as needed., 1189017=Non-performing assets (Ã¢Â€ÂœNPAÃ¢Â€?) totaled $2.3 million, or 0.27%, of total assets at June 30, 2013, down from $2.7 million, or 0.32%, of total assets at December 31, 2012.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an increase in labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector for the first quarter of 2013. The unemployment rate for Fairfax County, Virginia at the end of June 2013 was 4.5% compared to 6.0% for the state of Virginia and 7.8% for the nation. Information reviewed at the Federal Open Market CommitteeÃ¢Â€Â™s June 2013 meeting suggested economic activity was expanding at a modest pace during the first half of 2013. The historically low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact yields of variable loans and the securities portfolio. Recent upward movement in interest rates during the second quarter 2013 has slowed the loan origination volume for refinances and caused the investment portfolio to incur negative market adjustments on its available-for-sale securities. The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2013 decreased to 3.64% from the June 30, 2012 percentage of 3.74% as a result of the decrease in yields across the majority of interest earning asset segments. While there is no certainty to the magnitude of any impact, the continued extended period of low interest rates, as presently forecasted by the Federal Reserve, will continue to have an adverse effect on the net interest margin., 1071084=Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customerÃ¢Â€Â™s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, if any, deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit is based on managementÃ¢Â€Â™s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral normally consists of real property, liquid assets or business assets. The Corporation had $30.2 million and $9.7 million in outstanding commitments at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively., 924619=Included in other noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012 was a net loss of $1.8 million and a net loss of $2.3 million, respectively, relating to derivative instruments., 925212=In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the Ã¢Â€ÂœFASBÃ¢Â€?) issued Accounting Standards Update (Ã¢Â€ÂœASUÃ¢Â€?) No. 2011-03, Ã¢Â€ÂœReconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements.Ã¢Â€? ASU No. 2011-03 modifies the criteria for determining when repurchase agreements would be accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale. Currently, an entity that maintains effective control over transferred financial assets must account for the transfer as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale. The provisions of ASU No. 2011-03 removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee. The FASB believes that contractual rights and obligations determine effective control and that there does not need to be a requirement to assess the ability to exercise those rights. ASU No. 2011-03 does not change the other existing criteria used in the assessment of effective control. The provisions of ASU No. 2011-03 were effective prospectively for transactions, or modifications of existing transactions, that occur on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s financial statements., 1182090=At June 30, 2013, the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s assets totaled $841.7 million, compared to $863.9 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $22.2 million. Lower activity in the mortgage segment fueled by an increase in interest rates as well as the closing of our Denver Mortgage Production Branch caused loans held for sale to decrease $62.7 million. This decrease in loans held for sale was positively offset by an increase in interest-bearing balances of $12.9 million as well as growth in the commercial banking segment of $24.5. The increase in loans held for investment at June 30, 2013 in comparison with December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to a $7.2 million or 4.8% growth in commercial loans, a $12.7 million or 8.8% increase in residential real estate loans, and a $5.4 million or 17.8% increase in real estate construction loans. At June 30, 2013, loans secured by real estate collateral comprised 75.0% of our total loan portfolio, with loans secured by commercial real estate contributing 45.0% of our total loan portfolio, loans secured by residential real estate contributing 24.5% and real estate construction loans contributing 5.5%. Loans held for sale totaled $48.9 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $111.5 million at December 31, 2012. Loans held for sale fluctuates with the volume of loans originated during any given month and the length of time the loans are held prior to selling them in the secondary market. Deposits totaled $659.9 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $671.5 million at December 31, 2012, down $11.6 million. Management has utilized CDARS reciprocal balances and brokered deposits as a cost effective way to fund certain asset portfolio classes, namely the loans held for sale and the investment portfolio. With the overall reduction in mortgage banking activity during the first half of 2013, managementÃ¢Â€Â™s utilization of CDARS reciprocal balances and brokered deposits was reduced as noted by a $59.3 million decrease in those balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $56.3 million from $164.2 million at December 31, 2012 to $220.5 million at June 30, 2013, and when coupled with the decrease in time deposits of $11.0 million from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 as well as the CDARS balance reduction, accounts for the overall decrease in deposits., 233209=A summary of stock option activity under the Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 is presented as follows:, 415501=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s unrealized loss on its held to maturity municipal investment was caused by interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2013, this one security had an unrealized loss of $48,106. Based on the credit quality of the issuers, the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to hold this security until a market price recovery, and the determination that it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, the Corporation does not consider this investment other than temporarily impaired., 1033224=The following table reflects the differences between the fair value carrying amount of residential mortgage loans held for sale at June 30, 2013, measured at fair value under FASB ASC 825-10, and the aggregate unpaid principal amount the Corporation is contractually entitled to receive at maturity., 231448=The total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan as of June 30, 2013 was $554,319. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.56 years., 1087756=In order to evaluate the impact of this change on the overall CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s financial performance, condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements are presented below. The pro forma information is presenting results as if the Branch, which closed in the second quarter of 2013, had not been in existence during the three month periods ending June 30, 2013 and 2012. The adjustment for Branch closure does not reflect indirect overhead reductions management plans to make on a go-forward basis., 931651=In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Ã¢Â€ÂœBalance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and LiabilitiesÃ¢Â€?. This guidance eliminates offsetting of financial instruments disclosure differences between GAAP and IFRS. New disclosures will be required for recognized financial instruments, such as derivatives, repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements, that are either (1) offset on the balance sheet in accordance with the FASBÃ¢Â€Â™s offsetting guidance or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, regardless of whether they are offset in accordance with the FASBÃ¢Â€Â™s offsetting guidance. The objective of the new disclosure requirements is to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entityÃ¢Â€Â™s financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments. This amended guidance will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which involves disclosure only, did not impact the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows., 10337=The number of shares outstanding of Access National CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s common stock, par value $0.835, as of August 6, 2013 was 10,308,483 shares., 944539=Assets and liabilities measured at fair value under FASB ASC 820-10 on a recurring and non-recurring basis, including financial assets and liabilities for which the Corporation has elected the fair value option as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, are summarized below:, 1166835=On July 8, 2013, the Corporation redeemed its Floating Rate Capital Securities (Preferred) and its Floating Rate Common Securities (Common) with shareholders in the amount of $6.1 million and $187.6 thousand, respectively. Included in the redemption values were interest payments in the amounts of $52,736 and $1,635 for the Preferred and Common shareholders, respectively., 707923=No loans were modified during the first and second quarter of 2012 in connection with a trouble debt restructuring. There was one commercial loan previously restructured no more than 12 months prior to June 30, 2012 with a recorded balance of $95,990 that subsequently defaulted in the three month period ended June 30, 2012. No payment defaults occurred during the first quarter of 2012 for loans restructured within the last 12 months., 1189414=As noted in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, management closed its Mortgage Production Branch (Branch) located in Denver, Colorado. The Branch ceased taking loan applications during April 2013 with all obligations and activities terminated as of April 30, 2013. The closure has reduced mortgage banking revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2013 and will continue to impact future periods. Management did not incur any operating losses associated with the closure process and expects the continuing mortgage segment to be a profitable and meaningful contributor to consolidated earnings., 1073736=The Bank maintains a reserve for potential off-balance sheet credit losses that is included in other liabilities on the balance sheet. At June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 the balance in this account totaled $548 thousand and $483 thousand, respectively., 2141=For the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013, 355466=Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity that have an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 are as follows:, 773152=The following table presents segment information for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012:, 933143=In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Ã¢Â€ÂœIntangibles Ã¢Â€Â“ Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for ImpairmentÃ¢Â€? which is related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The guidance simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, and is similar to the new qualitative impairment test for goodwill. The guidance allows entities to elect to first perform qualitative tests to determine the likelihood that the indefinite-lived intangible assetÃ¢Â€Â™s fair value is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the entity would then perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact to the consolidated financial statements., 353837=The estimated fair value of securities pledged to secure public funds, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and for other purposes amounted to $47.0 million at June 30, 2013 and $60.7 million at December 31, 2012., 1177070=Securities in the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s securities portfolio are classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. At June 30, 2013, there were no non-agency mortgage backed securities or trust preferred securities in the portfolio. The estimated fair value of the portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors. Changes in estimated fair value are recorded in shareholdersÃ¢Â€Â™ equity as a component of other comprehensive income. Securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary. Management evaluates the securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of each security. Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to net income is recognized. At June 30, 2013, there were no securities with other than temporary impairment., 228805=The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (Ã¢Â€ÂœGAAPÃ¢Â€?) for interim financial information and with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€?). The statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All adjustments have been made which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Such adjustments are all of a normal and recurring nature. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2013. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s audited financial statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2012, included in the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012., 709473=As the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status with all payment applied to principal under the cost-recovery method. As such, the Bank did not recognize any interest income on its impaired loans for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012., 274225=The following table provides the amortized cost and fair value for the categories of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which reflects historical cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Available-for-sale securities are carried at estimated fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported on an after tax basis as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholdersÃ¢Â€Â™ equity. The estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility, and liquidity., 1168805=The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Access National CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s (Ã¢Â€ÂœCorporationÃ¢Â€?, Ã¢Â€ÂœweÃ¢Â€?, Ã¢Â€ÂœusÃ¢Â€?) consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, included in the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2013 or any future period., 930012=In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-5, Ã¢Â€ÂœPresentation of Comprehensive IncomeÃ¢Â€? (Topic 220): This update amended existing guidance relating to presentation of other comprehensive income in a convergence effort with international accounting standards.Ã‚Â This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholdersÃ¢Â€Â™ equity and requires a consecutive presentation of net income and other comprehensive income, and a reconciliation of the components of other comprehensive income.Ã‚Â Similar to the requirements of existing guidance, entities are required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented.Ã‚Â Although portions of this update related to the reclassification of adjustments out of other comprehensive income were deferred in December 2011, the amendments in this guidance should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after DecemberÃ‚Â 15, 2011.Ã‚Â Early adoption is permitted and the amendments do not require any transition disclosures.Ã‚Â The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s consolidated financial statements or results of operations., 705584=A troubled debt restructuring (""TDR"") is a formal restructure of a loan when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to a borrower. The Bank classifies these transactions as a TDR if the transaction meets the following conditions: an existing credit agreement must be formally renewed, extended and/or modified; the borrower must be experiencing financial difficulty; and the Bank has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider. ASU 2011-02 requires public companies to identify and account for TDRs for interim and annual periods beginning on or after June 15, 2011., 1190189=In order to evaluate the impact of this change on the overall CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s financial performance, condensed consolidated pro forma financial statements have been presented in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. The pro forma information is presenting results as if the Branch, which closed in the second quarter of 2013, had not been in existence during the second quarter of 2013 and 2012. The adjustment for the Branch closure does not reflect indirect overhead reductions management has made or will continue to make on a go-forward basis., 1072142=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The Corporation had $173.9 million and $174.8 million in unfunded lines of credit whose contract amounts represent credit risk at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively., 1192468=While the economy continues to show signs of improvement with unemployment rates declining, and we are beginning to see price appreciation in the local residential real estate market, there is no guarantee that these positive trends will continue. As such, we remain cautious as to the macro-economic risks, many openly identified by the Federal Open Market Committee, including persistently high rates of unemployment and underemployment, adverse impact of the higher Federal Tax Rates, and automatic reductions of Federal Expenditures that became effective beginning in the first quarter of 2013. As a consequence, we have generally retained more cautious loan underwriting criteria established during the financial crisis period of 2007 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2009. In spite of these challenges, we are proactive in seeking new client relationships driven by our target market profile: business-to-business and business-to-government companies with annual revenue of $1 million to $100 million and the various banking services needed by the business and the professionals associated with the businesses. With the aforementioned macro-economic uncertainty, we are finding most desirable clients and prospects carrying higher cash reserves and weary of increasing debt loads. These behaviors in our target market have elevated the levels of our short-term deposit balances while loan balance growth is muted by tepid utilization of loan commitments., 832370=The following table presents segment information for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012:, 440432=The allowance for loan losses totaled $13.0 million at June 30, 2013 compared to $12.5 million at year end December 31, 2012. The allowance for loan losses was equivalent to 2.03% of total loans held for investment at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Adequacy of the allowance is assessed and the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to expense no less than quarterly. Charge-offs are taken when a loan is identified as uncollectible., 929036=In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.Ã‚Â 2011-04, Ã¢Â€ÂœFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSsÃ¢Â€?. The Corporation did adopt ASU 2011-04, which generally aligns the principles of fair value measurements with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), in its consolidated financial statements in the first quarter 2012. The provisions of ASU 2011-04 clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, and expand the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. While the provisions of ASU 2011-04 did increase the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s fair value disclosures the adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material effect on the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s financial condition and results of operations., 416402=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s restricted stock consists of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (Ã¢Â€ÂœFHLBÃ¢Â€?) stock and Federal Reserve Bank (Ã¢Â€ÂœFRBÃ¢Â€?) stock. The amortized costs of the restricted stock as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 are as follows:, 412216=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s unrealized losses on corporate obligations were caused by interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2013, one security had an unrealized loss of $127,924. Based on the credit quality of the issuers, the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to hold this security until a market price recovery or maturity, and the determination that it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, the Corporation does not consider this investment other than temporarily impaired., 1021521=The following table presents qualitative information about level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value at June 30, 2013:, 1085898=In April 2013 management made the decision to close its Mortgage Production Branch (Branch) located in Denver, Colorado. The Branch ceased taking loan applications during April 2013 with all obligations and activities terminated as of April 30, 2013. The closure was expected to and has reduced mortgage banking revenue beginning with the second quarter of 2013. Management did not incur any operating losses associated with the closure process., 927937=In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-03, Ã¢Â€ÂœTransfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase AgreementsÃ¢Â€?. The guidance simplifies the accounting for financial assets transferred under repurchase agreements and similar arrangements and increases the number of transfers to be accounted for as secured borrowings as opposed to sales. The amended guidance is effective prospectively for new transfers and existing transactions modified as of the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. Repurchase agreements are offered through a commercial banking sweep product as a short-term investment opportunity for customers. All such arrangements are considered typical of the banking industry and are accounted for as borrowings. The Corporation adopted this guidance beginning with first quarter 2012 financial reporting; there was no material impact upon adoption., 1186287=Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2013 totaled $7.2 million compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2012. Earnings per diluted share were $0.69 for the first six months of 2013, compared to $0.71 per diluted share in the same period of 2012. Even with a $135.0 million decrease in loan origination volume for the six month period ended June 30, 2013 in comparison with the same period in 2012, net income remained stable. This decreased volume as well as the rise in current interest rates led to the $10.7 million decrease in gain on sale of loans when comparing the six month period ending June 2013 to the same period ending June 2012. The decreased income on loans held for sale was favorably offset by a $2.5 million reduction in salaries and management fees related to the production of loans when comparing the six month period ended June 2013 to the same period in 2012. Also mitigating the impact of the reduced loan volume was the gain on hedging activity of $3.9 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2013 compared to the $3.1 million loss for the same period in 2012. The growth in our loans held for investment portfolio as well as favorable changes in our deposit mix attributed to the increase in net interest income for the six month period ended June 30, 2013 of $541 thousand when compared to the same period in 2012. The reduction in the provision for loan loss as well as the income tax expense of $965 thousand and $354 thousand, respectively, further mitigated the impact of the reduced loan volume on net income., 312678=The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some of the securities may be called or prepaid without any penalties., 413022=The CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities were caused by interest rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2013, seven securities had unrealized losses of $947,216. As these securities are Ginnie Mae and government sponsored entity securities backed by the United States Government, the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to hold these securities until a market price recovery or maturity, and the determination that it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recoveries, the Corporation does not consider these investments other than temporarily impaired., 707305=One residential real estate loan totaling $210 thousand was modified in connection with a troubled debt restructuring during the six month period ended June 30, 2013. The modification granted the borrower reduced payments for a period of one year. There were no material financial effects as a direct result of this modification. No loans were modified in connection with a troubled debt restructuring during the three month period ended June 30, 2013., 5508=1800 Robert Fulton Drive, Suite 300, Reston, Virginia 20191, 891810=The following table shows the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (Ã¢Â€ÂœEPSÃ¢Â€?) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The numerator of both the basic and diluted EPS is equivalent to net income. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used as the denominator for diluted EPS is increased over the denominator used for basic EPS by the effect of potentially dilutive common stock options utilizing the treasury stock method.}","Ã‚Â  (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) ACCESS NATIONAL CORPORATION Ã‚Â  Commission File Number: 000-49929 Ã‚Â  For the transition period from _______ to __________ Ã‚Â  Transition Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Ã‚Â¨ Ã‚Â  or Ã‚Â  For the quarterly period ended June 30, 2013 Ã‚Â ",Item 3.

Last Updated: December 4 2012, 19:38 GMT Le Fondre sees reasons for cheer Le Fondre Sees Reasons For Cheer News/ Football/","*Current Season All seven goals were scored in a manic 34-minute period in the first half, with the defeat leaving Reading 19th in the table and four points from safety. But Le Fondre believes that if the players can replicate the performance that almost brought them a positive result against the leaders of the Barclays Premier League, then they will be able to rescue the current situation - starting against fellow strugglers Southampton this weekend. ""I think we can take heart from the performance and take it into the coming games,"" he told the club's official website. ""Every game is important in this league and every game is a tough test. But if we play against Southampton like we did on Saturday then we'll be okay."" Former Rotherham forward Le Fondre, who turned 26 on Sunday, expected a different type of game when Reading welcomed the Red Devils to the Madejski Stadium and was disappointed that United left with all three points. He said: ""When you play against that sort of opposition you expect a tight game but it didn't really play out that way. It was end to end, loads of chances, but we're disappointed that we were on the wrong end of the result. ""We had a top team on the ropes throughout the game - we created good chances from set-pieces, got in front but unfortunately couldn't quite hold on.""

Northern and southern region check stations registered 33 percent fewer deer than last year, while central region stations experienced a smaller decline of 20 percent. The Fish and Game CouncilÃ¯Â¿Â½s decision to eliminate the restriction of harvesting antlered bucks only in zones 21 and 24 boosted the central region total. Either-sex hunting was also restored to the full fall bow season in zones 1 and 3. Totals for check stations on those areas reflected an increased harvest in zones 1 and 3, however, the number of deer taken in those zones is not large enough to have a big impact on the northern regionÃ¯Â¿Â½s total as a whole., 232=According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental ProtectionÃ¯Â¿Â½s Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, an estimated 1,781 white-tailed deer were harvested statewide during the opening day of the 1997 Fall Bow Season on October 4.

This preliminary harvest estimate was based on a recent sampling of deer check stations throughout the state and represents a decrease from last yearÃ¯Â¿Â½s record opening day harvest of 2,555 deer. (Click here for 1986-1997 table.)

Opening day results for the rest","* estimate The fall bow season not only provides recreation to approximately 50,000 bow hunters, but also contributes to deer population management because it allows for the taking of antlerless deer. By harvesting a sufficient number of antlerless deer in each zone, populations are maintained in a healthy condition and at levels that minimize conflicts between deer and people. This is particularly important in areas with a high incidence of agricultural damage and deer-vehicle collisions. Overall, the Division's population management objectives are designed to reduce deer populations on 70 percent of the range, stabilize populations on 29 percent and allow for small increases in deer populations on only one percent of the stateÃ¯Â¿Â½s deer range. Zones where deer populations will be allowed to increase contain mostly public lands with little agriculture and minimal potential for deer-human conflicts.",True,2,0,"Fri, 24 Oct 1997 13:33:35 GMT",

When the Titans signed the former Raven to a four-year, $20 million contract in March, he was penciled in as the starter at right tackle. Don't break out the eraser just yet, but it's not as clear-cut as it once seemed. Oher remains the favorite, but he doesn't need to give coaches any reason to start thinking about what rookie Taylor Lewan might look like in the lineup. Oher knows he needs to rise to the occasion., 2034=Battle to watch: Taylor Lewan vs. Michael Oher. The rookie is big and physical, but wasn't really able to show off during the offseason because the NFL prohibits contact in May and June. The first-round pick made solid progress, however. He's better suited for the left side Ã¢Â€Â“ where he played in college Ã¢Â€Â“ but the right side probably provides his best opportunity to crack the starting lineup. Oher will have plenty to say about that, however., 49995=Tackles Michael Oher, right, and Taylor Lewan talk during practice at Saint Thomas Sports Park in May.

Q. Do people really eat 100% cacao bars with no sugar? IsnÃ¢Â€Â™t that like eating baking chocolate? There are more than a few connoisseurs who enjoy eating 99 percent and 100 percent bars. The intimacy of getting that close to great cacao is quite exciting. Try the 100% bar of Plantations Arriba. It is made from the Nacional or arriba bean, which has a higher natural sugar content than other varietals. Thus, even though thereÃ¢Â€Â™s no sugar in the bar, it has an innate sweetness. You can find it at echocolates.com. Try it plain, with coffee, with cognac or Cabernet Sauvignon, and compare it to their 90% bar. It's the Chateau Latour of chocolate, i.e., it's not for everyone, just for people with very serious palates. But even those who don't crave it should experience it. Other companies make 99% bars. If you see a good manufacturer with a 90%, 99% or 100% bar, try it! But, this is not like supermarket baking chocolate, which is made from the cheapest beans. See the next question. Q. WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s the difference between baking chocolate I get at the grocery, and baking chocolate or Ã¢Â€ÂœcouvertureÃ¢Â€? from Valrhona or Scharffenberger? Valrhona and Scharffenberger are two of several top chocolate producers that makes its couverture available to consumersÃ¢Â€Â”they tend to be more better-known names because they have good retail distribution. The difference between the","*Territorial designations vary by law in each wine-producing country. For simplicity of illustration, we are using the French analogy. U.S. law requires that a wine be made of 80% of both the grape variety and grapes of a particular region to be named, e.g. Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley. Otherwise, it must named, e.g. Red Table Wine from California. Some of the finest U.S. wines are blends, like Bordeaux, to achieve the flavor the winemaker seeks, and thus do not meet the 80% criterion and are blended. Often in this case, the wine is given a trademarked name, like Cain Five or Phelps Insignia. Q. How should I store chocolate? Fine chocolate should not be stored in a refrigerator. Chocolate prefers a cool, dry place away from light. The cocoa solids and cocoa butter emulsion remain stable when the chocolate is kept at a consistent temperature between 65Ã‚Â°F and 70Ã‚Â°F, and at a humidity level between 45% and 55%. Chocolate is temperamental: it absorbs odors very easily, and it is sensitive to changes in temperature. Moving from cold to warm and back again can cause chocolate to develop a grayish-white Ã¢Â€ÂœbloomÃ¢Â€? on the surface. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s the cocoa butter separating out from the chocolate. It still tastes fine and itÃ¢Â€Â™s safe to eat, but it mars the appearance. Find a cool place to store chocolate. The ideal place for both temperature and humidity is a wine cave",True,0,0,,

These days the analyses of most structures are carried out with the aid of computer programs based on the stiffness method or so-called matrix method of structural analysis. Stiffness method is a subset of the more general analysis method called the finite element method. Engineers cannot simply rely on the generated output from a computer program when designing a structure as there could be many sources of errors such as input data errors (due to misunderstanding of input parameters) and modelling errors.

Dies ist jedoch oft nicht der Fall bei: Wann reicht das B12 in Lebensmitteln nicht aus? Erst bei weit hÃƒÂ¶heren Dosierungen als den in Nahrungsmitteln ÃƒÂ¼blichen Vorkommen kann der KÃƒÂ¶rper weiteres B12 mittels passiver Diffusion aufnehmen. Dies machen sich Vitamin-B12-PrÃƒÂ¤parate zunutze, bei denen das Vitamin B12 entsprechend hÃƒÂ¶her dosiert ist und so vom Darm auch ohne Intrinsic Factor passiv aufgenommen werden kann. Der Grund fÃƒÂ¼r die Schwierigkeiten bei der Aufnahme von Vitamin B12 liegt im Aufnahmemechanismus des Vitamin B12. Das Vitamin erfordert fÃƒÂ¼r seine Aufnahme ein spezielles kÃƒÂ¶rpereigenes MolekÃƒÂ¼l Ã¢Â€Â“ den Intrinsic Factor. Auf diesem Wege kÃƒÂ¶nnen pro Mahlzeit jedoch nicht mehr als rund 2 Ã‚Âµg Vitamin B12 aufgenommen werden. Deshalb ist der Mensch bei der Versorgung ÃƒÂ¼ber Lebensmittel darauf angewiesen, mehrmals am Tag B12 aufzunehmen, um den Gesamtbedarf decken zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen. (3) Allein aus dem Gehalt der Lebensmittel kann also nicht abgeleitet werden, wie gut die B12-Versorgung ist Ã¢Â€Â“ auch bei regelmÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸigem Fleischkonsum kann leicht ein Vitamin-B12-Mangel entstehen. Ein Teil des B12 in Lebensmitteln kann zudem durch Braten und Lichtkontakt verloren gehen, so dass der B12-Gehalt bei der Zubereitung vieler Speisen stark abnimmt. (4) Bei einer vegetarischen oder veganen ErnÃƒÂ¤hrung ist das Risko einer mangelnden","Mehr dazu auch im ausfÃƒÂ¼hrlichen Artikel Vitamin-B12-Dosierung. Vitamin-B12-Formen in Lebensmitteln Vitamin B12 existiert in verschiedenen Formen. In Lebensmitteln sind die folgenden Vitamin-B12-Formen anzutreffen: (2) Methylcobalamin (vor allem KÃƒÂ¤se) Hydroxocobalamin (alle Lebensmittel) Adenosylcobalamin (Fleisch, Milchprodukte) Die synthetische Form Cyanocobalamin, die in gÃƒÂ¼nstigen Vitamin-B12-PrÃƒÂ¤paraten verwendet wird, kommt in natÃƒÂ¼rlichen Nahrungsmitteln nicht vor. Heute werden in PrÃƒÂ¤paraten darum hauptsÃƒÂ¤chlich Methyl- und Hydroxocobalamin verwendet Ã¢Â€Â“ Adensylcobalamin wurde bisher in der EU nicht zugelassen. AusfÃƒÂ¼hrliche Informationen zu den Unterschieden der Formen finden sich in unserem Artikel Vitamin-B12-Formen. Zwischenfazit Vitamin B12 und Lebensmittel Vitamin B12 findet sich fast ausschlieÃƒÂŸlich in tierischen Nahrungsmitteln. Die Aufnahme von B12 aus Lebensmitteln ist oft schwierig. Ein Vitamin-B12-Mangel entsteht meist durch mangelnde Aufnahme oder erhÃƒÂ¶hten Bedarf. Bei allen ErnÃƒÂ¤hrungsformen kann ErgÃƒÂ¤nzungsbedarf bestehen Ã¢Â€Â“ hier sollten die natÃƒÂ¼rlichen B12-Formen verwendet werden. Veganer und Vegetarier bekommen meist nicht genÃƒÂ¼gend Vitamin B12 durch Lebensmittel und sollten B12-PrÃƒÂ¤parate einnehmen. Im Folgenden werden nun die Vitamin-B12-Vorkommen in einzelnen Nahrungmitteln im Detail beleuchtet werden. Vitamin-B12-Vorkommen in tierischen Lebensmitteln Vitamin B12 wird sowohl bei Tieren als auch bei Menschen von Mikroorganismen hergestellt, die vor allem im Dickdarm leben. Leider liegt dieser Punkt hinter dem Absorbtionspunkt im DÃƒÂ¼nndarm, so dass der GroÃƒÂŸteil dieses Vitamin B12 ungenutzt ausgeschieden wird und die meisten Tiere genau wie Menschen auf eine Versorgung mit Vitamin B12 ÃƒÂ¼ber die Nahrung angewiesen sind.

Mehrfach am Tag eingenommen kÃƒÂ¶nnen Sie bei sonst guter Gesundheit jedoch Teil einer B12-Versorgung sein, die sich aus mehreren Quellen zusammensetzt. Ein Ersatz fÃƒÂ¼r B12-PrÃƒÂ¤parate sind sie im Falle von einem B12-Mangel, erhÃƒÂ¶htem Bedarf oder AufnahmestÃƒÂ¶rungen jedoch nicht. Der Gehalt liegt mit mit 80 Ã‚Âµg Vitamin B12 pro 100 g noch ÃƒÂ¼ber allen tierischen Quellen. Dies klingt zunÃƒÂ¤chst viel, relativiert sich jedoch, wenn man bedenkt, dass man ÃƒÂ¼blicherweise nur sehr kleine Mengen dieser Algen zu sich nimmt. Pro Portion werden darum kaum mehr als 1,5 Ã‚Âµg aufgenommen. Einige Algen enthalten Vitamin B12, jedoch sind hier noch immer viele Falschinformationen in Umlauf. Bei der Entdeckung dieser B12-Vorkommen wurden zur Bestimmung des B12-Gehalts zumeist alte Messverfahren verwendet, die auch auf dem Vitamin B12 ÃƒÂ¤hnliche Stoffe anschlagen (Vitamin-B12-Analoga). Diese auch Ã¢Â€ÂœPseudo-Vitamin-B12Ã¢Â€Â³ genannten Stoffe sind nicht nur wirkungslos, sondern verschlimmern einen B12-Mangel sogar noch. Der Gehalt und die BioverfÃƒÂ¼gbarkeit aus verschiedenen Algen, war lange sehr umstritten. (7, 8) Heute gilt die Alge Chlorella als einzige verlÃƒÂ¤ssliche B12-Quelle.

Jedan od najpoznatijih raÃ„?unovodstvenih skandala je bio u sluÃ„?aju ameriÃ„?ke kompanije Enron, koji je tu energetsku kompaniju u SAD doveo do bankrota. SrÃ…Â¾ skandala oko Enrona je bio knjiÃ…Â¾enje prihoda koji nisu ostvareni u punim iznosima, Ã…Â¡to je na kraju dovelo do nerealno prikazanog prihoda. U periodu od 1996. do 2000. godine, prema podacima Enron je iskazao poveÃ„Â‡anje prihoda od 750%, od 13,3 milijarde dolara u 1996. godini do 100,8 milijardi dolara u 2000. godini. Ovaj ogromni rast od oko 65% za godinu je nezamisliv u bilo kojoj industriji, ukljujuÃ„Â‡i energetski sektor, gdje je prosjeÃ„?ni godiÃ…Â¡nji rast u nivoima od oko 2-3% relativno uobiÃ„?ajen. Ovakvim raÃ„?unovodstvenim iskazima, Enron je 2001. godine bio prikazan na Ã…Â¡estom mjestu Fortune-ovog spiska 500 globalno najveÃ„Â‡ih kompanije po prihodima.[16]}","Osnovna raÃ„?unovodstvena jednaÃ„?ina glasi sredstva = obaveze + kapital. To je oblika bilansa stanja. Osnova za pravljenje bilansa stanja poÃ„?inje sa raÃ„?unom prihoda i rashoda, u kojem je iskazana neto dobit ili neto gubitak jednaÃ„?inom neto dobit (gubitak) = prihodi - rashodi.

The ""Read & Execute"" ACL does however also implies ""List Directory Contents"". Therefore, if you have only Read & Write permissions on a directory but no ""Execute"" you will not be able to see the contents of the directory and may also have problems when attempting to run the file through a Web-Browser. Arguably, this is not necessarily ""optimum"" security, but a balance must be struck between security, functionality and maintainability. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  OthersÃ‚Â : Read & Execute Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  GroupÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â : Read & Execute Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  OwnerÃ‚Â Ã‚Â : Read, Write & Execute Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  All DIRECTORIES/FOLDERS should have the following permissions. Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  OthersÃ‚Â : Read Only Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  GroupÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â  Read Only Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  OwnerÃ‚Â Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â  Read & Write Commonly used security practices suggest that all FILES should have the following permissions. Best Practices Ã‚Â  The files that are placed in the www or public_html root folder, or whatever directory your site (www.domain.com.au or localhost) points to on your hard drive should be owned by your user account, but only if that user is not what is considered as a privileged user like ""Administrator"" on Windows or ""root"" on UNIX/Linux. These accounts allow way too much access and should never be used for everyday","So as a comparison example to Unix Modes, when you are quoted something like 644, you would now need to break that into three entities: Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â :Ã‚Â  4Ã‚Â Ã‚Â : 4 The first number represents the ""Owners"" permissions, the second represents the ""Group"" permissions and the third, the ""Other"" permissions. So the Windows equivalent would be something like; Ã‚Â  Owner (6)Ã‚Â : Read & Write Ã‚Â  Group (4)Ã‚Â : Read Only Ã‚Â  Others (4)Ã‚Â : Read Only Ã‚Â  Hopefully, this example provides some insight in to the how to correlate Unix Modes/Permissions into Windows Permissions/ACL's. This document does not include more complex subjects such as ""effective"", ""Inherited"", or ""Special"" permissions. Despite Windows ease of use, Microsofts' Permissions and ACL mechanisms are actually reasonably complex and very extensive, but this might just give you a quick reference to try and alleviate some of the confusion surrounding Unix and Windows Permissions translations.

Previous Ticket,"Description (last modified by igloo) The recompilation check only recompiles a module when the interface of a module it imports changes. But with Template Haskell, it may need to be recompiled when the implementation changes. Concrete example below. It's quite awkward to fix. Perhaps a module that contains any splices should be recompiled always. Perhaps a module that exports any TH stuff (how would we tell?) should be flagged as changed if anything about it changes. Simon The following scenario reproduces this error (thanks to Bulat Ziganshin bulatz@Ã¢Â€Â¦): 1) create Main.hs containing code module Main where import Sub main = print $x and Sub.hs containing code module Sub where x = [| 1 |] 2) compile them with --make: C:\!\Haskell\!>ghc --make -fth Main.hs Chasing modules from: Main.hs Compiling Sub ( ./Sub.hs, ./Sub.o ) Compiling Main ( Main.hs, Main.o ) Loading package base-1.0 ... linking ... done. Loading package haskell98-1.0 ... linking ... done. Loading package template-haskell-1.0 ... linking ... done. Linking ... C:\!\Haskell\!>main.exe 1 3) now change Sub.hs to the following code: module Sub where x = [| 2 |] 4) and recompile program: C:\!\Haskell\!>ghc --make -fth Main.hs Chasing modules from: Main.hs Compiling Sub ( ./Sub.hs, ./Sub.o ) Skipping Main ( Main.hs, Main.o )",True,0,0,,

Without this library, the icons are not shown. GRAMPS 2.0 requires python 2.3 and the gnome-python and pygtk2 packages. The gnome-python module should be 2.6.0 or greater. The pygtk package should be version 2.5.0 or greater. General Requirements LÃƒÂ¤hdekoogista asentaminen desktop-file-utils: see list of programs to open a media file on right click on an image Other packages might also be useful: pyexiv2 is a module that allows Gramps to read and write metadata embedded in image files. It is used in the Metadata Viewer and Image Metadata gramplets. ttf-freefont: Useful as a font that supports a large subset of the unicode and is a true type. This works well with both gnomeprint and graphviz output. Graphviz, Inkscape: Gramps can make nice Genealogical trees (relationship graphs). These are generated by the Graphviz package, which defines a code (dot), as well as programs to produce graphs (dotty, to be called from command line). This gives you as researcher most power over how your tree will look, but has a learning curve. An alternative is to make a graphical report, converting the tree to an svg file, which you then can open/edit/refine in eg Inkscape. Spell checking: Installing python-gnome2-extras provides the gtkspell module, which adds spell checking in the notes","Obtaining the source The lastest stable version of GRAMPS can be downloaded from the GRAMPS SourceForge page. As of this writing, this is gramps-4.1.3.tar.gz. Extract this file into a directory:  tar xzvf gramps-zzz.tar.gz and then go into this directory:  cd gramps-zzz If you are interested in testing out the very latest development versions of GRAMPS, they can be obtained from SVN, see Brief introduction to SVN. The SVN versions of GRAMPS are potentially very dangerous as they have not been extensively tested - especially the ""trunk"" version which contains features that may still be partly implemented. Be aware that they may be prone to crashing and cause extensive data loss. Please use with extreme caution - and only ever on a copy of your data! Please, now is the time to read the INSTALL and README files accompanying the code. They come with the most recent information. Dealing with earlier versions If you have an older version of the Gramps source code installed you need to make a decision what you want to do with it before installing a later version. If you wish to keep the old version, make sure that you read the instructions in the INSTALL file regarding the use of the --prefix option to",True,1,0,,

Messages to listname-command@listdomain execute a command on listname@listdomain for the sender of the message; commands understood are ""subscribe"" and ""unsubscribe"". Otherwise, messages to listname@listdomain are forwarded to the list if the sender is subscribed to the list. If the list doesn't exist we print an error and exit with an error code.

Note that there are no references to any libraries. No foreign functions are imported: only what is declared in the header files as constants and structures/unions. X.h Xproto.h -I /usr/X11/include/X11 \ hsffig-1.1/bin/ffipkg -p XPROTO \ So, to prepare the XPROTO package, the following command may be issued:  Among many header files that come with X window system soyrces, there are two of interest: X.h and Xproto.h. The former contains various constant definitions: event codes, error codes, etc. The latter consists mainly of structure and union declarations. These declarations define binary structure of packets that X11 client and server exchange.    Import of header files only to reuse definitions contained in them   Features:  This example is rather speculative: it does not contain much usable code, but instead gives an idea how to reuse definitions of a transport layer protocol represented as a set of C structure declarations to re-implement the same protocol in Haskell.  7.4 X11 Transport Protocol  So, it is not necessary to remember where the library is","The corresponding structure in Xproto.h looks like this:  typedef struct { CARD8 reqType; INT8 percent; /* -100 to 100 */ CARD16 length B16; } xBellReq; This structure is to be filled with values and transmitted over the X11 client-server connection as is, i. e. as a sequence of octets, from zero to maximum offset within the structure memory image.

While there's no exact limit to the number of links you should include on a page, best practice is to avoid exceeding 200 links.

Using the Nofollow attribute prevents value from being passed to the linking page, but it's worth noting that these links are still added to the equasion when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so Nofollow links can also dilute pagerank. 2.2522522522523 Broken Links High impact",True,0,0,,
