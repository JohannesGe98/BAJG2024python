They have cook-outs on a couple occasions, there are times where there is pizza, popcorn, sub sandwiches, and other goodies to let us know they want us to feel comfortable. There are career drives, when certain companies come in and sign-up students. There is just always something going on. It is fun and at times entertaining.', 'I attended YSU at one point in time. Unfortunately, I left because it was really hard to stay focused in class and on homework assignments. I can honestly say that the instructors at ITT have a way to make the students understand that they can come to them when ever there is a problem. The instructors always let us know how we are doing with grade reports. They will let us know what is missing and what is to be done to make anything up. The instructors at ITT have the students best interests in mind and help out in any way they can, even if it is a personal problem.', 'The teachers at my campus always have some fun through out class as well as take the class on trips depending on your major. In one of my classes we went down to the court houses to do a security check on the perimeter, to tell if it could be breached and what would be a better way of securing the property.', 'There is an area with vending machines on my campus. There also is a wide variety of fast food places and restaurants near by.', 'There is not a dorm at the campus I attend but, there may be one at another location in other areas or an apartment near by. I personally live about 5 minutes away. There are a few locations. So there are opportunities for anyone who wants to further their education and/or career choices.', 'ITT Technical Institute offers a wide variety of courses at the campus locations and on-line, if you chose to take that route. There are also programs they offer that students can sign-up for to get a certificate for the training. It is a great asset for the portfolio.', 'If you are searching for a college that will meet your every need I would definitely suggest ITT Technical Institute.', 'I really believe that ITT is the best pick for me because, they are close to my home, the teachers are always available when I need help, and I prefer to go to a school campus vs. doing courses online. All the staff at ITT are very welcoming and welcome anyone who comes through their doors to apply. There is a Financial Aid Department, a Career Services Department, Tutoring Department, Computer help aid, and a Library on campus, in which all students are aware about what is going on with their financials, can get help with a career choice that best fits them, and there is always someone to help out if a student needs help for anything.

In some of the classes you will come across someone already in the field that you can talk with to get some insight.

This makes more loans but not anymore then any other university. If you attend for a bachelors degree after you recieve an associates degree here, it is 20% off. Am enjoying being here For the year in an half I have been here I enjoy coming to school. At times it is hard to stay motivated to show up to class but that is for ever college student. In some of the classes you will come across someone already in the field that you can talk with to get some insight. Am learning a lot I am learning many tasks that I would use in the field quickly in the degree I am attending ITT-Tech for. There are breaks in between quarters which helps me obtain the knowledge I have received. A lot of work is given, but group work is highly recommended to lessen the work load.

Keep an open mind and just do your best.', 'Pace is expensive and the better your academic standing is, the more scholarships and grants you will receive. They do try to cover all of your financial need but it has happened on a few occasions that some students get their financial aid package altered abruptly and this could cause them to pay more than they anticipated. This probably occurs in most colleges, not just Pace, so be sure to fill out your FAFSA as accurately as possible. There are many great professors here and if you make the right choices in terms of taking the right classes for you and doing your work, you will get the most of your education and feel that the money was worth it.', 'Pace really goes the extra mile to make new students feel welcome. Orientation, for example, is a 2-day program with an overnight stay. They have workshops/presentations where they address all your questions and give you information on everything from financial aid to dorming. They divide everyone into groups where you can make friends even before school starts. They also plan fun activities such as a boat trip around Manhattan from Southstreet Seaport--and this was all on Orientation! Throughout the year, there are several activities and organizations to get involved with--information is sent to you weekly so you are aware. There is a mandatory University 101 class which is to help students with the transition from high school to college. There is always something to do here and there seems to be a place for everyone. Pace puts an emphasis on life outside the classroom as much as your classroom experience.', 'Personally, if I get anything out of Pace it will be the ability to think critically. I have not even attended the school for that long and I feel like my mind has never been so stimulated. If you take the right classes, you will definitely learn a lot. It is important to take several classes outside your major and the Core Curriculum is designed to help everyone do that. It is not only to make you a well-rounded person, but to open your mind to different perspectives of seeing the world and inculcate in you the ability to think critically.']]",Pace University - New York City Campus Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Pace-University-New-York-City-Campus/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/68811,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00090-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898517327,898409675,HORIZONTAL,"08/12/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 68 out of 68 people found this review useful. 1 of 121 Nichole from Brooklyn, NY Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There is a ton of security in the dorms, and you can even ask a security guard to escort you from one Pace building to another and they will walk you where you need to go. I feel very safe at Pace. New York can seem a scary place, and you do have to be careful in the city, but pace is just a few blocks from the two most secured areas in the city with surveillance cameras practically on every block. NYPD officers aren't far either. Like any area, you need to be smart and careful, but Pace and New York City make sure you feel as safe as you can."", ""Being a city school, Pace's Greek Life is not as strong as some bigger universities in more suburban areas. It does exist, though. There are several sororities and fraternities and they are very welcoming to new members. They also hold many events that any Pace student is invited to, not just Greek members. If you're extremely interested in Greek Life, Pace may not be the place for you. If Greek Life isn't your top priority, but you could be interested in it, then Pace will set you up."", ""Pace has a lot of clubs and activities. The Honors College is a great community. Most performing arts majors are involved or work with a club in the performing arts department or run by performing arts students. Non-performing arts students also have many opportunities for clubs, all for different types of students. It's also relatively common that students start their own clubs at Pace. I know several people in my class alone who have done it."", ""Pace is definitely for the more liberal minded student. There is a ton of LGBTQ support. There's not much negativity in that area. It's also for the progressive type of student. Living in New York is no easy feat. It can be a very harsh city, but if you're the type of person that can see past that and find the culture, wonder, and beauty of the city, then you'll be fine."", ""Most people do their own thing in New York, so there aren't any specific traditions that everyone at Pace does. But being in downtown New York City, there's lots to be seen and done. Even just blocks away from Pace is the Seaport. In the summertime you can catch a ferry around the statue of liberty (which you do at orientation) and in the wintertime you can shop and go ice skating. There are restaurants everywhere, so you can't ever have nothing to do between classes."", ""I can only speak for Pace Performing Arts, I can't speak for other majors. Pace is expensive, but they're very generous with scholarship, grant, and financial aid money. I pay only a couple thousand out of pocket per year. The rest is covered by scholarships, grants, or loans. The Pace Performing Arts Department certainly gives you bang for your buck. The education I'm getting is helping me develop my talent immensely and at the same time is giving me connections to the professional theatre world. My professors are working in the industry and what I'm learning is of the utmost importance to my career. Most people I know in non-performing arts majors feel the same, but I can't speak for everyone."", ""New York City obviously has a ton to do. There are tons of free events and places to go. And Pace is right next to any of the important subway lines that get you through Manhattan and into Brooklyn. You can never be bored living in New York. Pace is in downtown Manhattan, a few blocks from Wall St., the 9/11 memorial, and Battery Park (where you can see the statue of liberty). It's three stops on a subway away from Times Square and Bryant Park, and a few more from Central Park. There are museums galore, most of which have student discounts or free days. I mean, it's New York City, there's a million and one things to do for fun."", ""There's one cafe, and you get tired of the same food over and over again, but it's not awful. I've had some great chicken dinners at the cafe. And their mac and cheese is to die for. They're working on getting more vegetarian and vegan options. There are several gluten-free options as well. We also have our own Starbucks in the cafe that you can use your meal plan money at. There is a make your own pizza and pasta station, mexican, sushi, a grill (it makes everything from breakfast sandwhiches to mott sticks to burgers and grilled cheese), a salad bar, and soup bar, and a bread and bagel station. There are also waffle makers. It's not the best school cafeteria, by any means, but it has cafeteria. And you're in New York City, you're gonna wanna go out to eat anyway."", ""Pace is a city school, so the dorms are small. But they're pretty okay. The main freshman dorm is in Pace's main building, so there are days where you can wake up, walk out of your room in your PJ's and take the elevator to the cafe or to class. Maria's Tower (the main freshman building) is a ton of fun, you can become really involved with your floor mates. The upperclassmen dorms are fine. They're quieter and farther from the main building (no more than three blocks). But they stay relatively clean. There is a brand new dorm on Broadway that was just built. But the dorm life is like that of any other college. The RA's and Pace University Housing are great and progressve. They organize awesome events that are actually fun and cool. They're very good at helping establish relationships between floor-mates."", ""The thing about Pace is you really have to know who's who. You have to use ratemyprofessor.com and ask around about certain classes and professors. I've had some of the most amazing and inspiring professors because I listened to what my peers had to say about certain classes. But there are definitely some character professors at Pace. In a good way. There are several with large personalities. You also will get out of a class what you out into it. If you do the bare minimum that shows some effort, you'll probably get by. But if you want to challenge yourself that's easy to do at Pace. Professors are always available to talk to you and challenge you with outside of class opportunities, but you have to go out of your way to foster that relationship. The Honors College is also tremendous, with lots of outside opportunities offered, be they academic or simply fun things in New York."", ""For any prospective student applying to schools, it is most important that you do your research. Prepare early, get your applications in as early as you can so you can enjoy the rest of your year without having application after application hanging over your head. Know what interests you and what makes you excited about a place or program. Remember that you are interviewing and auditioning these schools as much as they're interviewing and auditioning you. Most importantly, trust your gut. You'll know when you're meant to be some place. I knew Pace was where I wanted to go because of the students, and that was a priority for me. There were other professors at other schools that I liked, but I didn't like the students at the other schools, and if they were going to be who I spent the next four years with, I didn't wanna go there. Know what's important to you, and through research assess it to the best of your ability."", ""Your campus at Pace University is not just the pace buildings, it's the entirety of New York City.

Then after a while you realize the menus don't ever change and even the food at the buffet, goes on a cycle of what is there. On weekends when the commuters are not attending and it's only the people that dorm around the area of the school, not everything in the cafe is open and they don't restock on their beverages. towards the end of the semester most kids find themselves not eating so much in the cafe and more so eating at places outside of the school."", ""In Maria's Tower the whole dorm is honestly like one big family.

If you do not you will end up over piled with work because you decided to go out and party on a night you should have stayed in to do homework and study. A lot of the teachers also want you to do a lot of self teaching, so they will go over it in class but expect you go over it again alone to get a better understanding.', 'Anyone coming to the NYC campus the only advice I can give you is to manage your time. If you can manage your time in the city you will be perfectly fine academically. There is always something to do so you will never be bored, but if you let that take over and forget about academics, you will not be happy at the end of the semester.', 'Pace University is a place where people go to get their degree for what they want to become in life, but in pursuit they also find out who they are as a person. The atmosphere of the school is very tight nit and comfortable to the point it makes you feel as if you are still at home.

Pace feels a lot like high school most of the time and people like to stare at you and it often feels as though some students don't get along with others. The classes are okay, but the professors are substandard and often give you the impression that they are trying to pass you instead of actually teaching you anything useful.

There are some horrible professors here and there are some wonderful inspiring professors here as well. The overall quality of education depends on your department and field because they are not all the same. My roommate was in the acting program and she loved it. She applied to Julliard and actually made it to auditions! But did not make the final cut. My rating is for the Business school. It seems to be more of a theoretical approach instead of a well rounded approach to your degree. Once again I feel like the departments within the business school don't communicate and collaborate with each other which could help them out a ton by working together. Your education is pretty much based on your ability to get internships and how you perform in them."", ""Just make sure that the academic programs here are the best for you. If you have applied to some of the top schools in your category and didn't get into any then Pace is a great plan B. In my case, I am a business student and the location of Pace gave me great opportunities for internships and gave me an awesome experience but the overall quality of education here is not the best. There are better schools out there for business like McCombs school of business at University of Texas, Harvard, Princeton, Ross school of business at University of Michigan. I didn't have much of a choice coming out of high school because my grades where not the best so Pace was the best option for me and I made the most of what I got.

As previously mentioned, the prices for food and drink are questionable.', 'There are campus activities posted on the bulletin boards all around school, ranging from language exchange groups to movies in the student unions and seminars/workshops/speaking engagements with prominent academics, entertainment professionals and politicians.', 'The quality of the food varies, but, for the most part there is a healthy selection available in the cafeteria and the downstairs cafe that caters to all different kinds of diets. There is also a Starbucks in the cafeteria. The cost of food and drinks, however, seem to be somewhat inflated.', 'I cannot speak directly to dorm life since I live off-campus.', 'This is a very rigorous program academically, creatively, emotionally and physically. Successfully completing all the required reading and writing requires a huge time commitment and shrewd planning. Being proactive about staying healthy and getting enough rest is also crucial.', 'Financial planning is very important since there are limited scholarships available from ASDS and Pace. Also, given the nature of the work, effective time management is obligatory. Having a life outside the program is also essential to maintain a sense of balance.

The library is not very huge but they have a network with all the libraries in New York and you can get any book you want. The only thing is that you sometimes have to fight to be heard with the administration. If you don't ask yourself, they don't give you anything, and you sometimes have to ask several times.

They invite huge stars such as Brad Pitt, Robert de Niro, Bradley Cooper etc...and students can get in! You need to check the online calendar at pace.edu to know where and when it happens or you will lose lot of chances to have fun. When you got to know more about activities at Pace you can go outside. 5mins away from the campus there is the Seaport where you can grab an ice cream. You can also cross the Brooklyn bridge or visit the Twin Towers museum a few blocks away. For shopping, there is a Century 21 5 mins away, and about 20mins away you can do lot of cheap shopping on Broadway."", ""Pace University has two cafeterias including a Starbuck Coffee. Food is very diverse: we have a Chinese stand, a sushi stand, a Mexican one, a salad bar, a sandwich bar, a fastfood bar, a soup bar and finally a hot meal stand. Food is good and not too expensive (if you eat an healthy meal, it's cheaper than going out). People however complains it is a little bit repetitive if you are dorming."", ""I a not personally dorming but I am sometimes visiting my friends and they tell me about their dorms. I know principally about the St George one (said as best one) and the Maria's Tower one. St George is such a nice dorm! It is situated in Brooklyn and the quarter is very nice to hang out at night. The staff is very very friendly. The dorm includes two lounges, with both a pool and a TV. People hang out their until the sun goes up. Everytime I went there there was a good ambiance, however some people told me sometimes there are some unfriendly people who can create quarrels and that they can bring some bad ambiance at some floors. The kitchen is big with lot of equipment. However it can get dirty very easily and people don't always clean up their mess. The bedrooms are pretty cool, with individual showers. Pace University have a special software to match you with the person that best fit to your way of living and it generally works. I would recommend dorming there. For Maria's Tower, well it is very useful since it is literrarly in the university. However they don't have any kitchen and bathroom are shared. People told me it can be dirty. Also, they created a new dorm in Broadway and it looks very nice. Basically St George is the best dorm. It is nice to stay on NYC campus the first year to get to know new people, but the price is as expensive as getting a flat in the city so lot of people move out their second year."", ""If you chose your professors well, there is a good level of academic at Pace. Yes, you can find a professor that is not very good, as everywhere. However, and that is something important to tell about Pace, all the professors are dedicated to their field of study. You CAN'T find a professor who does not like what he teaches. And that can make lot of difference. I got some excellent professors who knew a lot about their field of study and did research and had doctorates. Professors can be very challenging and always try to help you."", ""Social Life: I recommend going to the Welcome Week events in order to meet new people. Try to go to a lot of activities at the beginning, because you might not make friends in class (people don't really talk to you in some classes), and after, you will want to explore the city so you might want to do so with another person ;) Also, make friends with Junior and Senior, they have the best tips for everything you want and know ALL the places. Academic Life: Professors at Pace are dedicated and above all very friendly. If you need anything just ask! Also, a lot of opportunities I got came from them. If you work hard, and are respectful, they will become your mentor and help you get your way through university. Also, try not to hang out too much (which can be difficult in NY!). I got some friends who failed because they got into the let's hang out every day syndrome that new yorkers students can develop. Finally, try to attend the business meetings. They can look boring but they are very helpful and will teach you a lot! Daily Life: Daily life can become very expensive. Put money on your Pace Card, it offers promotion that you can't have if you pay in cash/credit card. Also, at the end of the semesters they give back the cash on your card during one week, take it first because they do it for only a few students. Also, there are lot of meetings at Pace where they offer you free food. You cant take a class on how to behave during business meeting and at the same time eat for free! Win-Win."", 'Pace is a university where there is understanding, diversity and where people can speak their mind. Pace is a university where people will help you make your projects come true. Pace is a university where you feel loved and cheered up.']]",Pace University - New York City Campus Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Pace-University-New-York-City-Campus/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/68811,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,97,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00090-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898517327,898409675,HORIZONTAL,"08/12/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 68 out of 68 people found this review useful. 1 of 121 Nichole from Brooklyn, NY Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

John Street is pretty basic. Fulton is suites and more apartments style (can you say personal kitchen!) but you still share a bedroom with one other person.

Or do you want to live in a less expensive building where your classrooms and cafeteria are, but have communal bathroom/showers?

Our Student Development Center (which all student organizations have to go through for planning and funds) is good at grinding your gears and raising your blood pressure, so the best place to find out about campus activity is through word-of-mouth, the bulletin boards around campus, or just by roaming the halls and being in the right place at the right time.

That is pretty nice. Otherwise there is great variety in the caf including vegan and gluten-free options. There is a Starbucks in the caf that accepts your meal plan money. Caf food does get old and boring once you've been there past your first semester.

As with any school there will be some professors that stand at a solid 3 on a scale of 1-10 while others will stand at a strong 9 or 10 even.

The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.

It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated.

It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements. The rule of thumb Current Ratio for small companies is 2:1, indicating the need for a level of safety in the ability to cover unforeseen cash needs from current assets. Current Ratio is best compared to the industry. Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities', 'Quick Ratio QUICK RATIOQUICK RATIO (or Acid Test Ratio) is a more rigorous test than the Current Ratio of short-run solvency, the current ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages.
