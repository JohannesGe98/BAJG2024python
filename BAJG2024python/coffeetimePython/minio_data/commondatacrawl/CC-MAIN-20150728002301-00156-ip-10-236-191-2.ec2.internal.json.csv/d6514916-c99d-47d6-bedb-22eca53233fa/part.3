There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

For the first month of school we had an involvement fair with many organizations welcoming us to join or participate in their groups, as well as activities and events like Late Night on Fridays. The Husky football and upcoming basketball games are exciting not to mention fun to go to with friends. Academic Rigor The classes are on a whole new level compared to high school. Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops.

Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students.

South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

If you do not feel confident walking back to your dorm from a night class, there is a service you can call and they will escort you to your residence hall. Always use the buddy system if you do not feel safe however. If you ever happen to be in the worst case scenario and do not know where you are, the campus is always lit up with blue emergency lights that you can follow. Also, if you ever want to report something bad, you can always call Watch Dogs, which is our own UConn police department.', 'I do not know much about the Greek life but there are many sorority and fraternities a person can join. They range from people with similar majors to people who share a common ethnicity.', ""There are so many clubs and Activities that I do not know where to start. During the first two weeks of class, be sure to check out the Involvement Fair where the 500 clubs and activities gather to recruit new people and to keep the students informed about what goes around in the University. It ranges from showcasing the break-dancing club to Dumbledore's Army, which will be pretty popular for Harry Potter fans. One of the Programs I am in, called Jump-start, works with little kids to help them transition into school surroundings."", 'If you are big on your ethnicity or culture, make sure you visit the Cultural Centers at the Student Union. For example, the Puerto Rican and Latin American Cultural Center always celebrates Hispanic heritage by putting together dance classes to teach Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, and so on. They also host parties and Community Outreach programs.', ""Make sure that at your Orientation for the University of Connecticut that you at least visit the statue of Johnathan the Husky, our mascot. It is good luck to rub on his nose. Also, do not walk straight through the seal that is in between the library and the Center for Undergraduate Building because I was told it was bad luck by graduate students. make sure you at least visit the famous UConn Dairy Bar and try their home made ice cream. It's delicious!"", 'Take advantage of the sales at the University of Connecticut Co-op store because it can get very expensive. Also, there is a coupon book that your Resident Assistant will give you during the first few weeks of school that has discounts from restaurants in Storrs. Take full advantage of that because you will not always want to eat a the dining halls.', 'while many undergraduates come into college expecting to party, it is not the only way to have fun on campus. There is an arcade in the Student Union with all the game systems, ice hockey, two lanes for bowling, and so much more. My personal favorite is the Guitar Hero game because I am very good at it. You can also go to Late Night, which is an event at the Student Union every weekend night where they offer henna tattoos, karaoke, so many other things. You will always know what it is going on here at UConn because of the email system that alerts you of all the different events you can attend throughout the week.', 'The food here is overall decent but I personally was tired of it quickly because I missed the home cooked meals. However, there is such a variety of food that you will never go starving. One of the dining halls is specifically for vegans and vegetarians while another one serves comfort food in a buffet style. Take advantage of the points that come with your meal plan. Points are kind of like money and you can use them to buy food at the Union Street Market where they sell soups, salads, pasta, burritos, pizza, grinders, and so much more. Basically one point is the equivalent of one dollar but make sure you use them wisely because once they are all gone, you cannot get anymore until the nest semester starts. If you are in a hurry to class or do not have time to sit down and eat, you can always stop at a Grab-and-go location where they can quickly make wraps, sandwiches, and grinders.', 'The residential life is great here, especially if you decide to live in a Learning Community. As part of the Women in Math, Science. and Engineering Learning Community, I have found it easier to have connections with people and find my true friends. It creates a smaller community within such a large campus that focuses on bonding with your peers by engaging in community service programs and attending social events together. It truly feels like a second home here because there is a sense of unity among all of us. Once you become an upperclassman and feel like you can afford it, you can live in an apartment with friends or request to live in a suite.', ""At times many of the assignments seem impossible or you may feel as if you cannot get all your work done on time. I promise that if you take deep breaths and take breaks while studying and doing your work, you will be just fine. Also, take advantage of your Professor's or Teaching Assistant's office hours because they really do want to see you succeed and are always to willing to help if you do not understand a topic discussed or need some clarity. Also, if you feel like you are struggling with your classes, you can always sign up for tutoring at either the Writing Center to get papers edited or at the Q Center where they can help with Chemistry or Math courses."", 'Walking will be your new best friend here so be prepared to walk a lot, especially if you are not sure how the bus schedules work here. Also, make sure that you get involved in activities and clubs starting your freshman year so that you can build up your resume but no so much that you feel overwhelmed. It is also a great opportunity to meet new people and expand your circle so take advantage of that so that you are not sitting in your room with nothing to do. Do not become lazy! College is a whole new world where you are completely independent and can make your decisions so make sure they are good ones.', 'The University Of Connecticut is a great school and I would give a four out of five stars.

There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year.

If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question.

UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

Bring lots of things to decorate with like christmas lights and posters, tapestries are nice too. Some rooms have curtain rods too. Not all rooms have Wi-Fi so make sure you can hook up to ethernet or bring a router to plug in. The RA's are very laid back in most cases and as long as you're not being loud or annoying they don't care what you do. Room inspections are a joke in a sense. My friend keeps a lizard in her room and they didn't even notice. Don't leave alcohol out and you'd be fine."", 'You will spend a lot of time on school work. You are responsible for your own learning in a sense, teachers cover a lot but its up to you to memorize it and know it for their tests.', 'Apply for a specific school or major if you can.

Those who tend to be a bit shy will also bloom and grow to be more assertive once they find their niche. Everyone in UConn finds something or other that they are passionate about, and students often make the best of friends from sharing similar interests, classes, or even living in the same residence hall. Also, those who are academically serious and like to challenge themselves should come here, since the courses at UConn are very different from what students in high school are accustomed to. Tips for prospective students Personally, being in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows me to be flexible in what classes I take. I can switch majors depending on what classes I have taken and not have to worry about wasting my time taking a certain class not within my major. Don't expect UConn to be a party school where your parents will foot the bill, since the university has established many programs for serious students who want careers in business, healthcare and medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and the fine arts.

Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students.

On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility.

Bang for the buck UConn provides so many different scholarships, grants, financial aid, and loans for academic, athletic, and many other categories.

Many courses on campus are graded through multiple choice exams, especially entry-level or 1000 level courses. This excludes examinations in quantitative (Q) classes and writing (W) classes. You have to study to succeed. It is not necessary to study your notes every day (for most courses at least), but allow one must allow themselves plenty of time before exams to review material. Two days of studying is not going to earn the average student an A., 404431=The woods have trails that lead to interesting things. The best tradition was Spring Weekend. It's a big block party at Carriage on Thursday, one in Celeron on Friday and another in X-lot on Saturday. This is usually done on the last weekend before the last week of class. It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

The atmosphere in the dorms is great though, and you usually grow very close to the people in it, especially if you live in a learning community."", 'As a commuter, I have taken classes at both the Greater Hartford Campus, and at Storrs, and they are both very rigorous. The classes at Storrs are slightly more difficult than the ones at the regional campus, as the class sizes are much larger and many programs try to weed out students. At the regional campus, class sizes are smaller and more personal. However I think the quality of the education and the motivation to succeed thrives more at Storrs,', 'I encourage you to strive to keep your GPA up, and apply early. As more students apply, the less your chances of getting into the main campus at Storrs becomes. However, you can also attend one of several regional campuses, which can save you a lot of money.', 'UConn is a great university that offers a great variety of academic courses and extracurricular activities.

For the first month of school we had an involvement fair with many organizations welcoming us to join or participate in their groups, as well as activities and events like Late Night on Fridays. The Husky football and upcoming basketball games are exciting not to mention fun to go to with friends. Academic Rigor The classes are on a whole new level compared to high school. Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops. Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before. At UConn, there is a lot of help provided for students if they just know where to look.",True,0,0,,"{851784=The rigor of the academics depends on the college and program that you are enrolled in. Many courses on campus are graded through multiple choice exams, especially entry-level or 1000 level courses. This excludes examinations in quantitative (Q) classes and writing (W) classes. You have to study to succeed. It is not necessary to study your notes every day (for most courses at least), but allow one must allow themselves plenty of time before exams to review material. Two days of studying is not going to earn the average student an A., 404431=The woods have trails that lead to interesting things. The best tradition was Spring Weekend. It's a big block party at Carriage on Thursday, one in Celeron on Friday and another in X-lot on Saturday. This is usually done on the last weekend before the last week of class. It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great.

I can switch majors depending on what classes I have taken and not have to worry about wasting my time taking a certain class not within my major. Don't expect UConn to be a party school where your parents will foot the bill, since the university has established many programs for serious students who want careers in business, healthcare and medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and the fine arts. The other colleges that make up UConn as a whole (School of Business, Nursing, Pharmacy, etc.) also have their own specific programs and study plans, so whatever major you're planning on going into, there will be advisers and student mentors who are there to help you and provide motivation and support for those times when you feel overwhelmed. Bang for the buck UConn provides so many different scholarships, grants, financial aid, and loans for academic, athletic, and many other categories.

Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

I can switch majors depending on what classes I have taken and not have to worry about wasting my time taking a certain class not within my major. Don't expect UConn to be a party school where your parents will foot the bill, since the university has established many programs for serious students who want careers in business, healthcare and medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and the fine arts. The other colleges that make up UConn as a whole (School of Business, Nursing, Pharmacy, etc.) also have their own specific programs and study plans, so whatever major you're planning on going into, there will be advisers and student mentors who are there to help you and provide motivation and support for those times when you feel overwhelmed. Bang for the buck UConn provides so many different scholarships, grants, financial aid, and loans for academic, athletic, and many other categories. They are definitely more affordable than private colleges and going to a state school has the benefits of having more state-funded scholarships for students. Am enjoying being here There are so many people to meet and so many things to do on campus, and so little",True,0,0,,"{851784=The rigor of the academics depends on the college and program that you are enrolled in. Many courses on campus are graded through multiple choice exams, especially entry-level or 1000 level courses. This excludes examinations in quantitative (Q) classes and writing (W) classes. You have to study to succeed. It is not necessary to study your notes every day (for most courses at least), but allow one must allow themselves plenty of time before exams to review material. Two days of studying is not going to earn the average student an A., 404431=The woods have trails that lead to interesting things. The best tradition was Spring Weekend. It's a big block party at Carriage on Thursday, one in Celeron on Friday and another in X-lot on Saturday. This is usually done on the last weekend before the last week of class. It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best. Towers is really good and has Kosher and Halal. The North and Northwest Dining Halls are good and have a good stir fry bar. East is not bad and Putnam is mediocre. McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways.

If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth.

I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students.

Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one.

Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops. Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before. At UConn, there is a lot of help provided for students if they just know where to look.

The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth.

I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility.

Honestly, this could be the case for all universities, but it really makes UConn great if you have a good roommate and you know how to organize and get along with them. You can make friends with people from all over the dorms, though, and it is a very social place, especially throughout typical freshman and transfer student dorms, such as north and northwest.

I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility.

Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most.

Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before.

Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

Anyone could be a part of any greek organization so just do your research and make sure to explore your options because not every greek org is for someone, you want to choose once that's best for you, and greek life is not for everyone. It is a very good way to build all your skills and network so keep it in mind. People will always talk about some negatives associated with every greek org but it is up to you to find out what is true and what is not, and if it is not good then do not be a part of it."", ""I already covered this as well. You will find at least one organization that interests you, if not then you can make your own. There are a lot of activities, we have a student's activities office and you can always call or visit them to see what is going on campus because there is always something going on. Every Friday we have late night and you basically get free stuff but you do have to wait in line. you could get a pillow cover, tattoo, food etc. During the first week it is the week of welcome also known as WOW weekend, this is mostly for the freshmen, so there is an ice-cream social, free shirts which you usually get at various events during the whole year, and a BLOCK PARTY!"", ""I believe every type of student will enjoy this campus. You will find an organization or friends that will make you feel welcome. Dont' be scared to get out and get involved.

Other people go out and that is also fun, depending if you are very social. There are various bars that you must be 21, but there are also house parties, you just have to be careful and make sure you go to a safe one and always stay in groups and have a buddy with you.

However I encourage you to try out various dining halls to see which one you like. No matter what dining hall you go to you will get tired of the food because that's just the way it is. During breaks when you go home you will be able to eat your parent's food again and you will see the difference. At first the dining hall food will seem so good but everyone reacts different to it. Make sure to go to the gym if you are eating out of your routine. Also keep in mind that you will most likely eat in the dining hall you live closest to or the one that's closest to your last class that you eat right after. It all depends on your schedule. It is a big campus so if you live in south and stay close to there, you will not want to go all the way to northwest to eat there."", 'Dorm life is a different experience for everyone. There are some very good dorms, and there are some old not so good dorms. As a freshmen you do not get to pick where you live but you will get to pick after that and checking out the dorms inside for yourself is better than having a friend tell you about it. To me, south campus is the best, and more upperclassmen are there or learning communities. There are co-ed dorms and some with all boys or all girls, keep in mind that if you are going to be very involved like me, then you will not spend so much time in your dorm but you still want to live in a dorm whose location will be close to your classes, whether it be music/arts, sciences or social sciences.', 'Your success and everything you are able to apply to your career depends on you. You will make everything out of your college experience so make sure to take advantage of everything and try to benefit from every opportunity. Remember that your major does not equal your career.

But networking is very crucial, so take advantage of that as much as possible.', 'Make sure to communicate with your professor if you are having difficulties with your classes. Do not skip classes right away because your grade depends on how well you know the material, how the professor is presenting it to you which is a big deal if your grade is only based on your exam grades, and not all classes are easy to pass with just reading on your own and skipping class. Make sure to explore everything on campus and get involved because it enhances your college experience. Try to stabilize a good job your first to second year so you can count on one job if funds reduce.

Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before.

Those who tend to be a bit shy will also bloom and grow to be more assertive once they find their niche. Everyone in UConn finds something or other that they are passionate about, and students often make the best of friends from sharing similar interests, classes, or even living in the same residence hall. Also, those who are academically serious and like to challenge themselves should come here, since the courses at UConn are very different from what students in high school are accustomed to. Tips for prospective students Personally, being in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows me to be flexible in what classes I take.

It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best.

McMahon is good from 7:30PM to 10PM. I like to research the menu so I know where to eat. On days when there is Pasta Bar or Stir Fry Bar, get there early because the lines will be huge this year!, 866248=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73686=Depends where you are. West campus? Not so great. South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question. Students know the most :), 393713=There are many challenging classes for one biology 1107., 263407=UConn has over 300 clubs and societies on and off campus. UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10.

If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth.

I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility.

They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though.

There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily.

Those who tend to be a bit shy will also bloom and grow to be more assertive once they find their niche.

Also, those who are academically serious and like to challenge themselves should come here, since the courses at UConn are very different from what students in high school are accustomed to. Tips for prospective students Personally, being in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows me to be flexible in what classes I take. I can switch majors depending on what classes I have taken and not have to worry about wasting my time taking a certain class not within my major. Don't expect UConn to be a party school where your parents will foot the bill, since the university has established many programs for serious students who want careers in business, healthcare and medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and the fine arts.

Willimantic isn't too far away and the bus will take students there for free as long as you present your Uconn ID."", ""Halloween is pretty big here so expect that! Late night is another big thing and always fun to go to if you can make it. The Dairy Bar is also a must for everyone at least once. They make their own ice cream fresh and it is delicious! Just don't get the large sizes because they pack a lot of ice cream into even a small bowl."", ""Excellent value for a pretty good price. I'm an in-state student so tuition is cheaper for me but even so since it's a public university it's not that bad. Around the average college price tag nowadays. As long as you're willing to seek it out, there's plenty of things to do so the only excuse to be bored is that you're lazy. The academics are great and the faculty and staff are friendly. Students are helpful and it's a nice place to be if you like scenic southern New England."", ""There's plenty to do at Uconn so it really depends on what you want to do! Late Night is always a lot of fun - they leave the Union open until 2am on Friday and Saturday and have free things and different activities depending on the theme and the night. They always have free food as well. There are movies at the Union all weekend and most of them are fairly new releases. They have Friday Flicks which are older movies (past few years) shown for free. The other movies are $2 with a valid student ID. I'm not sure if anyone considers this fun but there's a fully equipped gym with a lap pool and rock wall that is free to students again with a valid ID. They also have free ice skating nights at the ice rink generally on Fridays and Saturdays. If you bring your own skates it's totally free otherwise it's around $4 to rent skates. If partying's your thing there's plenty of that too. I'm not too big into party life but there are parties every weekend so definitely opportunities for that."", ""For the most part the food is excellent. It's an all you can eat buffet style and all meal plans come with unlimited swipes into the dining hall during dining hours. You can go to any dining hall on campus so if you have class in one area that's far away from your normal dining hall you generally don't have to worry because there's probably another one close by. Within each housing area there's a dining hall close by and some dorms (McMahon, North) have the dining hall right on the dorm. If you can't stay for a meal at the dining hall you can get a grab n' go at participating dining halls. You use a flex pass (the number of flex passes depends on the level of your meal plan and you can add more if you want them) to get a grab n' go which consists of a deli sandwich, bag of chips/cookie, piece of fruit, and a drink. There's also several cafe's on campus where you can get a bagel or bowl of soup or some other snack on the go. The cafes are some of the only places that take points which are convenient but not quite money-wise in the long run unless you eat at the cafes once or twice every single day. Points do not carry over and are only good at cafes but are convenient if you don't want to deal with cash or debit cards. Husky Bucks are like points except you have to deposit them (almost like a bank account) and you can use them pretty much at any vendor on campus as well as a few off campus. Husky Bucks do carry over. 1 pt = 1 Husky Buck = 1 dollar Flex passes get you grab n' go's or let a friend/family member into the dining hall. Your level of meal plan will determine the number of flexes as well as the number of points on your account. The most basic plan has 75 flex passes and no points. There are other places to get food both on and off campus. There's 2 nearby Dunkin Donuts and a Starbucks in Storrs Center. There's also 3 Subways in the area, a Wendy's in the Union, a couple pizza places, etc. etc. No chance of being hungry at Uconn!"", ""Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking.

Also, professors and the TA's have office hours to help any students with classes, we have a library for studying as well as the Q Center, which is very helpful for students who need to brush up on their math and quantitative skills or just understand a concept in math they've never learned before.

They are definitely more affordable than private colleges and going to a state school has the benefits of having more state-funded scholarships for students. Am enjoying being here There are so many people to meet and so many things to do on campus, and so little time! For the first month of school we had an involvement fair with many organizations welcoming us to join or participate in their groups, as well as activities and events like Late Night on Fridays. The Husky football and upcoming basketball games are exciting not to mention fun to go to with friends. Academic Rigor The classes are on a whole new level compared to high school. Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops.

They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though.

There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November.

I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

They are definitely more affordable than private colleges and going to a state school has the benefits of having more state-funded scholarships for students. Am enjoying being here There are so many people to meet and so many things to do on campus, and so little time! For the first month of school we had an involvement fair with many organizations welcoming us to join or participate in their groups, as well as activities and events like Late Night on Fridays.

I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",

Those who tend to be a bit shy will also bloom and grow to be more assertive once they find their niche. Everyone in UConn finds something or other that they are passionate about, and students often make the best of friends from sharing similar interests, classes, or even living in the same residence hall. Also, those who are academically serious and like to challenge themselves should come here, since the courses at UConn are very different from what students in high school are accustomed to. Tips for prospective students Personally, being in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences allows me to be flexible in what classes I take.

They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though.

Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double.

They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility.

It has been suspended by the administration but it will resurface this 2012-13 year. Learn the UConn chants at football and basketball games. Attend Late-Night at least once. Go to Horsebarn Hill to hang out and watch a beautiful sunrise or sunset., 834708=UConn is a large school with a lot of options and possibilities for all their students. Although it is located in a rural area, almost everything a student may need is within walking distance either on campus or in the newly built Storrs Center. Not only is it an academically competitive school, but, don't forget, we are also the 2014 dual champions for college basketball!, 406752=South Dining Hall is the best.

South Campus? Pretty amazing, but unless you are a senior or junior, it's hard to get a room there, and they cost more. It also stinks because housing went up for the 2012-2013 school year. Off campus housing is available also, but a lot of the places near campus are sometimes the party central of the weekends, so you have to be careful with that if it isn't your thing, 758562=Some schools only require 2 continuous years of highschool language but Uconn requires 3 so make sure you come in with that otherwise you'll be taking 2 semesters here. If you have to take Chemistry 1127 I recommend taking it at one of the community colleges instead of here since their program isn't known to be too good. The professors are willing to help if you go to them but it's a really tough course. The best way to get your questions answered is to talk to students. They offer the best insight on what classes to take, how to organize your schedule, which dining halls are the best, etc. etc. The advisors and faculty will try to help but because it's such a big school there's a lot of bureaucracy and oftentimes you'll be told by one department to talk to another department which will then direct you to another department - so on and so forth. And if a student doesn't know the answer to a question you have they'll be able to easily direct you to the best person to answer your question.

UConn often hosts concerts, comedy shows, and other extraordinary performances at Jorgensen center for the performing arts, which are always enjoyable. On top of that, UConn has a world renown sporting program, which includes the 2011 NCAA National Champion Basketball team. Attending games are a campus favorite, and always offer a great time., 180938=I just received my Financial Aid and am thankful that my fee bill is under 2000 per term(Commuting to West Hartford branch)! I am excited to go to UConn with a little bit of cash left in my pocket!, 757552=Uconn is academically strong. I'm an engineering major so the subjects are fairly difficult but they're not impossible. I get the feeling that all the faculty really want to help the students so talk to them if you have any questions on the material! They will be willing to work with you but you have to make yourself known since the freshmen classes are so large. Don't expect too personal of an academic experience with your professors though unless you're talking to them all the time. Most of them will have over 1000 students (not in one lecture but over a few lectures) which is a downside of the school. The TAs are excellent though. You can get to know them better if your class has a discussion since discussions are generally capped at a max of 30 students. (Most discussions I'm in have no more than 20), 754766=Not super but not awful. For me it was either pay for a dorm room or pay for a car and live 20 minutes away at home. Having a car is a real hassle on campus and I don't recommend it because it's such a nightmare to drive around and find parking. If you're a commuter you have to park far away in one of the outer lots and if you're a resident student you need 54 credits to have a car on campus anyways. The dorm staff does an excellent job of keeping the bathrooms and common areas clean and tidy. There are certain points of the day where things are less-than-neat but that's to be expected somewhat in a college dorm. The rooms are decently sized - I believe they're actually slightly larger than an average dorm room. Depending on where you're housed your room will be different. Most freshmen are housed in the Northwest Quad but you can be put anywhere if you select random for your housing. For the most part the other students are respectful of quiet hours and whatnot. It is a college dorm though so there are points where people are being rambunctious. The RAs do a good job keeping up-to-date information and are very realistic in their expectations. They're not out to get you which is a plus. There's no air-conditioning when it gets super hot though (this can happen in September sometimes, it IS New England) and they don't generally turn on the heat until mid-November. They do have AC in the bathrooms and common rooms - same with the heat. A good window fan is recommended as well as a couple others to keep air flowing. I'm pretty sure heaters are not allowed so bring a lot of blankets and sweaters if you're the type who hates cold/gets cold easily. Mini-fridge is also a good idea but only 1 per room so make sure you coordinate with your roommate(s) as to who will bring it. There's a height restriction of 32 but not too big of a deal since most mini-fridges are smaller than that anyways. You can rent one from the university if no one brings one. Rooms are generally doubles and there are never forced triples or quads (rooms that were doubles being used for 3 people) You can get into a triple or quad if you want to and if you're a freshman and they run out of housing you might get placed in a triple/quad even if you designated that you wanted a double. It doesn't happen too often though and I don't actually know anyone that it's happened to but it's a possibility. Filling out the housing application and returning the deposit as soon as possible is a good idea., 95228=The Parade-Parade along with Homecoming in October when there's a king and a queen chosen., 591956=2013 was the first year for the underwear mile run, they have an oozeball tournament every year, it is mud volleyball basically., 494101=The food isn't all too great. There are lots of dining hall options based on location, however you need to find the one you like best. On the down side most of them have weird hours (Towers Dining Hall closes at 7:15, where others are open until 10. Also they open at 10am on weekends and I find myself starving to death if I wake up early). Get a good meal plan, because the places that require Husky Bucks and Points happen to be the better food options, and they're super convenient to have in the Union.}",
"[['Categories', 'Campus Safety', 'Clubs and Activities', 'Great for these types of students', 'Bang for the buck', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', ""Just like any other big schools, there are sometimes problems that happen on campus, but with that being said I would say it's a very safe school. None of my friends or I have ever had a problem in the time we have been on campus. The Uconn police are always around and the campus blue lights give the campus a safe feel. There's also ambulances and firefighters on campus if there ever are any emergencies. Most students look out for each other, even when partying to make sure their fellow Huskies are safe."", ""I'm not exaggerating when I say there are hundreds of clubs on campus. There's a club or activity that fits EVERYONE's interests, guaranteed. There's clubs that are very involved on campus, and some more laid back clubs. Intramural sports are also really fun, I played flag football this semester and it was a blast. If you get out there and look you can definitely find a club that suits your needs."", ""I'd honestly say Uconn is great for all kinds of students just because it's so big and diverse that it can accommodate really all types of students. But, I would say that if you want a big school(about 20,000 undergraduates) with the feel of a small school, Uconn is perfect. It's just big enough where you can meet new people all the time, but small enough where you won't feel like you're just another student, but that you actually matter."", ""At Uconn you truly are getting an affordable but, priceless education at the same time if that makes any sense. The school's out of state rate is very competitive with a private school, and their in state tuition price is really low. I live in Connecticut, and this was the best option for me financially, by far. You get the college experience and education of a private university for half the price."", ""You may have heard that Uconn is located in the middle of nowhere and that there is nothing to do besides watch the cows, but this hasn't been true in my experience. There's a movie theater in the Student Union, which plays new movies every Friday night. Also the Union has Late Night every Friday night, featuring karaoke and great food. There's an ice skating rink right by campus for when it gets colder out. Athletic events happen every single day, throughout the entire year, where you can watch the Huskies dominate their opponent per usual. Sometimes the university has really cheap bus trips to places like Boston or New York, which are a great way to get away with your friends for a day. There are also a bunch of parties Thursday-Saturday, especially when it's warmer out, which are really fun and a great way to meet a bunch of new people. On top of all that, Storrs Center is only a two minute bus ride away, with a bunch of restaurants and stores where you can shop. I rarely find myself bored on campus, and when I do its very easy to gather up some friends and find something to do."", ""Out of all the colleges I've visited, Uconn easily had the best dining options. There's something like seven or eight dining halls on campus and we get unlimited dining hall swipes to all of them. The food is actually surprisingly very good, and the dining halls do a really good job of mixing up what they put out so you don't really get tired of eating the same food all the time. The Student Union also has great food including the Student Union Market(which you can use points at) and Subway, Panda Express, and Dunkin Donuts. Also, you can order food from Wingz Over Storrs, DP Dough, and many other local places, most of which are great and reasonably priced. I'd definitely give the food a 10 out of 10. I eat better at school then I do at home!"", ""Dorm life has been terrific in the time I've spent on campus. I live on a co-ed floor which is atypical for the university, but I love it! Most of my best friends are people that live right on my floor! Everyone always has their doors open(except maybe midterms and finals week) so it makes it really easy to make friends. The RA's enforce the rules of the dorms, but are really cool and fair. I would say the rooms are average size for a college dorm room, but there's plenty of space. My building(Towers) is really far from most of the classroom buildings, but most dorms are a lot closer."", ""My time at Uconn has been very demanding academically, but I have also learned a bunch since I got here. I'm only a second semester freshman so most of my classes are still electives, but even these are mentally stimulating and challenging. Most of my professors have been interesting, funny, and seem to actually know what they're talking about, not hired off the street. They also have been very willing to help throughout the semester. I spend as much time as I can at the library, doing homework and studying especially between classes during the day. You can definitely do well academically, but you have to apply yourself."", ""Well the first tip could really apply to any school and is really cliche(you have probably read it in a ton of articles already) but you have to GET OUT THERE! Don't sit around waiting for the college experience to come to you, you have to go get it. Talk to as many people as you can, try different clubs that you wouldn't normally try, play intramural sports if that's your thing. Do whatever you can to get involved and to make college all it should be. Second tip is definitely bring clothes for all types of weather. The weather here can be weird and the first semester starts out really hot, but by the time winter break comes it gets very cold."", ""Coming to Uconn has been the best decision I have ever made, and can't imagine myself anywhere else, including the other schools where I initially applied. From the food, to the busy campus, to all the friends I have made, my short time at the University of Connecticut has already been the best time of my life.

They are definitely more affordable than private colleges and going to a state school has the benefits of having more state-funded scholarships for students. Am enjoying being here There are so many people to meet and so many things to do on campus, and so little time! For the first month of school we had an involvement fair with many organizations welcoming us to join or participate in their groups, as well as activities and events like Late Night on Fridays. The Husky football and upcoming basketball games are exciting not to mention fun to go to with friends. Academic Rigor The classes are on a whole new level compared to high school. Although the whole college experience will take some time to get used to, the classes provide a way for students to explore what they love most. Much of our homework and studies are done through online companion websites, so we don't have to lug heavy books around, just notebooks and writing utensils or laptops.

This traveller booked his own international flights between the UK and Africa, via Mombassa in Kenya. He asked us to arrange a week in southern Tanzania, and we arranged regional flights for him between Mombassa and Nairobi, with Precision Air. A week before this trip, the airline notified us of a change to the return flight from Dar es Salaam to Mombassa: it would depart 5 hours earlier. This schedule change was completely beyond our control; we understand why it upset our traveller. In situations like this, we try our best to make the best possible arrangements for our travellers given the new constraints. In this case, the only practical alternative was for them to cut one night off their safari, and spend it in Dar Ã¢Â€Â“ in preparation for their early-morning flight back to Mombassa; there was no way for them to spend their last night in the Selous. To soften the blow, one of our team did comment that some of our travellers have enjoyed a night or two in Dar. WeÃ¢Â€Â™ll stick by this comment, as itÃ¢Â€Â™s true Ã¢Â€Â“ simply read the reviews of the Oyster Bay in Dar Ã¢Â€Â“ and youÃ¢Â€Â™ll see what we mean.

The problem with the Precision air times did mar our relationship with expert africa at the time, but now we feel that they did pretty much everything they could to ensure we had the holiday we wanted. Someone at Expert Africa (not Peter) asked if we had ever been to Dar es salaam when trying to make us feel that another night there was ok, but it is still not somewhere we would choose to spend any time. This person also said that we would ""only"" be missing dinner at Impala camp, whereas in fact we missed an afternoon activity, dinner, morning activity and breakfast as well as being in a beautiful place.

There are some services that are only run during the boot process. Make sure NOT to disable any runlevel services that are needed by the system to run smoothly. For example, many of these type of services will begin with a prefix of boot. chkconfig -l |grep on One of the most important tasks is the removal of any network services from a systems start-up (init) process that are not needed.

For example, if you don't know what the atd service does, go to /etc/init.d and open the file atd. And in the script look for lines that start programs. In the atd script the startproc $ATD_BIN $ATD_ARGS line starts the Ã¢Â€ÂœprocessÃ¢Â€? atd. Now having the name of the program that is started by this service, you can check the online pages of atd by running man atd. This will help you to find out more about a system service.

"[['PREDICTOR RATIOS:', 'Altman Z-Score ALTMAN Z-SCOREALTMAN Z-SCORE reliably predicts whether or not a company is likely to enter into bankruptcy within one or two years: If the Z-Score is 3.0 or above - bankruptcy is not likely. If the Z-Score is 1.8 or less - bankruptcy is likely.A Z-Score between 1.8 and 3.0 is the gray area, i.e., a high degree of caution should be used. Probabilities of bankruptcy within the above ranges are 95% for one year and 70% within two years. A Z-Score between the two is the gray area. Obviously a higher Z-Score is desirable. It is best to assess each individual companys Z-Score against that of the industry. In low margin industries it is possible for Z-Scores to fall below the above. In such cases a trend comparison to the industry over consecutive time periods may be a better indicator.

EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE).

Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity).

This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages.

A company turning their inventory much slower than the industry average might be an indication that there is excessive old inventory on hand which would tie up their cash.

However, if the company is in financial trouble, on the verge of bankruptcy, a sudden increase in inventory turns might indicate they are not able to get product from their suppliers, i.e., they are not carrying the correct level of inventory and may not have the product on hand to make their sales. If looking at a quarterly statement, there probably are more or less turns than an annual statement due to seasonality, i.e., their inventory levels will be higher just before the busy season than just after the busy season.

Formula:COGS---------------------------------------------(Inventory (current) + Inventory (last period) / 2)', 'Inventory Turns (Period End) INVENTORY TURNS (Period End)INVENTORY TURNS (Period End) measures the ending efficiency of the firm in managing and selling inventories during the last period, i.e., how many inventory turns the company has per period and whether that is getting better or worse. It is imperative to compare a companys inventory turns to the industry average. A company turning their inventory much slower than the industry average might be an indication that there is excessive old inventory on hand which would tie up their cash. The faster the inventory turns, the more efficiently the company manages their assets. However, if the company is in financial trouble, on the verge of bankruptcy, a sudden increase in inventory turns might indicate they are not able to get product from their suppliers, i.e., they are not carrying the correct level of inventory and may not have the product on hand to make their sales. If looking at a quarterly statement, there probably are more or less turns than an annual statement due to seasonality, i.e., their inventory levels will be higher just before the busy season than just after the busy season. This does not mean they are managing their inventory any differently; the ratio is just skewed because of seasonality.

The goal, in most cases, is to demonstrate efficiency through having a high turnover rate and therefore a low days inventory. However, realize that this ratio can be unfavorable if either too high or too low. A company must balance the cost of carrying inventory with its unit and acquisition costs. The cost of carrying inventory can be 25% to 35%. These costs include warehousing, material handling, taxes, insurance, depreciation, interest and obsolescence.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements. The rule of thumb Current Ratio for small companies is 2:1, indicating the need for a level of safety in the ability to cover unforeseen cash needs from current assets. Current Ratio is best compared to the industry. Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities', 'Quick Ratio QUICK RATIOQUICK RATIO (or Acid Test Ratio) is a more rigorous test than the Current Ratio of short-run solvency, the current ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity).
