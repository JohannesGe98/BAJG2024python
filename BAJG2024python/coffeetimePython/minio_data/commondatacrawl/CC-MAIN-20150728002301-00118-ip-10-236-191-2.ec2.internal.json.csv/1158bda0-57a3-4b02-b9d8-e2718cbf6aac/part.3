Through the help of the student government and faculty, any idea that a student has can and will be supported financially to help make the event possible. An event happens every week. The school currently has a wine club, beer club, BBQ club, Bread club, and a Cheese Club. There are also clubs in the making where students explore different restaurants and critique the food like professionals. It is all very fun.', 'The school is the perfect setting for students who are pursuing a culinary arts major. To be surrounded by people who are only in food related programs truly helps drive the passion for everyone. It is a one of a kind experience.', ""This school does have some different traditions like having the whole school congratulate the graduating class as then ascend the stairs to the graduation ceremony; it's very heart warming. The campus is quite unusual since it use to be an old winery. One of the coolest rooms is the Barrel Room which looks like the old winery, including barrels that hold 2,000 gallons of wine. It is quite a site to see!"", 'Overall, the CIA offers an invaluable education to all of the students. Everyone learns so much from the chefs, and there are so many volunteer opportunities for gaining experience like conferences, weddings, and VIP events. Networking is an important aspect in this industry and utilizing the school as this source is pivotal. The dorm life does need improvement, but fun events like Build Your Pizza, Game Nights, and other fun events keep the resident life very enjoyable.', 'This school is in Napa Valley, so students take their opportunity to get what they can out of it. Lots of wineries to visit, biking/hiking trails, food adventures through the town Saint Helena, Yountville, and Calistoga are common things to do. We also a local movie theater and shopping areas. Napa is also in a good location where it is a couple hours away from Sacramento, UC Davis, San Francisco, and San Jose, so weekend trips to visit these popular sites are very fun to take.', 'The school offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is amazing. Sometimes the food can be repetitious depending of the class that is making food. When this case does happen, it is not uncommon for groups of students to go into town and have a good time at one of the local restaurants, which are all fabulous.', ""Although the dorms are quite comfortable, the company that the school works with has been somewhat slacking. They do the repairs and fixings in the rooms and buildings. Although the RA director is trying to make them get their stuff together quicker, they are still slow. The school is also somewhat slow for providing money for the director to update rooms such as the laundry room so then there can be more washers and dryers. The walls are rather thin as well, so you can hear people from your room rather easily, but the RA's are doing well to help keep noisy residents quiet during sleeping hours."", 'The chefs are amazing. Each chef has worked in their field for many years ( some are even Certified Master Chefs!). You will learn so much from them and treat their knowledge like gold. Learning to work with them and helping them with their projects is the best thing that you can do to help make your experience at this school everlasting.', 'All students should come to the school with their passion and understanding that their skills will be tested to the limit. In the first semester, expect to do a lot of reading, more than you want, so be prepared! Those who are coming should have with them everyday: permanent markers, calculators, colored/designed duck tape for your tools, small notebooks to write your recipes in, a bookshelf for your room, HE products for the washer and dryers, and anything else that can keep your chef whites white.', 'The educational program at CIA Greystone is phenomenal in standard compared to other programs offered in the country. The program prepares students for the business, professional expectation, networking, and skills that rank the students above other contenders when applying for jobs. However, one thing that needs improvement is the dorm; it needs more funding and attention to make the outside experience at the school more enjoyable.']]",Culinary Institute of America (CIA) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Culinary-Institute-of-America/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1190,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,34,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00118-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906457863,906403461,HORIZONTAL,,"{258278=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 207781=Just try, I applied June 2nd and started school June 18th.

Surrounded by natural foliage, the architecture is truly exquisite and when one travels over the bridge there is always the scent of fresh pine and greenery in the air.', 'When you are looking to have a little fun to break up the time spent studying, look no farther than the many clubs or activities hosted by the college. There are groups to suit a myriad of different interests, and you can always find posters for events and opportunities plastering your nearest wall or cork board. Finally, at the college one thing we do not lack is green space. If you are looking to take a stroll, or perhaps indulge in some Ultimate Frisbee, there are spots all over campus to fulfill those needs. Careful though, you might make a few friends in the process!', 'While we do not have very many places to eat on campus, the main cafeteria is excellent about serving up a variety of different cuisines each week. One popular item are the Pho noodles, a Vietnamese creation where you can add on things to round out your bowl. It creates a hearty, slightly colorful option to delight your stomach. Off campus however, there are endless options both within walking distance or in the radius of a short drive. One thing is for sure - whatever you have a hankering for, you are more than likely to find it close by.', ""Being a community college, there are no actual dorms. However, this factor does not cancel out the fact that around the school is a vibrant college-centric community. Many students live nearby, and businesses all around are filled with study haunts that host these academics on a regular basis. Even on the campus itself there are so many places where one can go to learn or to relax in between their educational regime. There are always exciting things going on, and perhaps because of the size of our school, we're more invested in keeping the days fresh and lively. People routinely spend all day on campus even when they have only one, perhaps two classes, because there are many activities to pursue."", 'Forget about any pop culture references about community colleges being a playground for those between high school and adult life, or as a mere stepping stone to a four-year university. Classes here will make you keep pace with any university student, but all the more to your benefit, in certain ways you will surpass them. At a smaller institution you will be subject to closer teacher to student interaction, as well as a tight knit community of faculty and other students who all share your values and dreams. Tacoma Community College is a place where hard work is valued and encouraged, and their classes reflect that. We strive for excellence here.', 'One of the most important things that I would suggest to incoming students is quite simply - take it seriously. Be on the ball with deadlines, be proactive with coming to class every day, seeing your counselor each new quarter for academic advising, use the resources at your fingertips. The faculty here want to help you, and we have some of the most impressive professors here who are dedicated and open about their work. If you open yourself up to the possibilities, you will surely succeed.', 'Tacoma Community College is truly a jewel among community institutions, defying any and all negative stereotypes. It is diverse in both opportunities as well as in the students who attend. When I attend class here, I can feel myself inching ever closer to my goals, and the college itself provides me with tangible support in reaching those aspirations.']]",Tacoma Community College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Tacoma-Community-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/48703,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,3,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00118-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906510087,906473195,HORIZONTAL,,"{150813=I can't say too much about their academics because I'm starting my first year this September.

Honestly, I think one of the biggest strengths of Wellesley is how diverse a Wellesley woman can be. While I am not really a partier and prefer to spend my weekends hanging out in the city with close friends, there are definitely people who know how to party.

In fact, oftentimes I will be walking to my next class or my dorm and see a girl who will make me wonder how she got into Wellesley or why she applied, since she seems so different from me, and yet I love Wellesley and she does too. But even on opposite sides of the spectrum, Wellesley women truly and wholeheartedly love Wellesley--even the ones who hate it the first year come back and love it in the years following. We especially love the opportunities it offers to study overseas, meet student at other colleges, make up your own major, meet wonderful professors, and become friends with people you wouldn't be caught dead with in high school. Wellesley can sound like a school for bitc*es, or straight-edged uptight and prim girls, or lesbians only, or aggressive and scarily nerdy or smart girls, etc., but the student population will really surprise you. (Please don't take offense by any of my descriptions, I know they are very stereotypical but are only examples!) Don't cross this school off because it is all-girls and you or people around you have negative stereotypes of it--come over for spring open campus and see for yourself! I was hesitant in applying because my sister attended Wellesley and loved it, and since she and I are polar opposites I was highly dubious of whether Wellesley would be a good college fit for me. But after one year at Wellesley, I am ever grateful that I applied and decided to attend--it is really wonderful in so many ways."", ""Don't worry too much if you don't have a perfect GPA, perfect standardized test scores, or if you don't have a million extracurriculars. Many girls I know at Wellesley didn't have a stellar academic performance, but were accepted. Just do your best in whatever you can, and write a good essay about why you want to attend! My essay was honestly about my love for Jamba Juice, Asian music, my friends, my fashion sense, and the quirks that my friends will make fun of me for--it showed my personality and wasn't overdone or boring to read (well, in my opinion and my friends' opinions) and I think it really made a different in the acceptance process. And this is from my own observations and others': Wellesley isn't incredibly hard to enter, the way Harvard, Princeton or MIT is, but honestly, it is one of the hardest colleges to graduate from with a good GPA because Wellesley women are so excellent we have to grade-deflate to make some sort of distinction between the good, the excellent, and the outstanding. I have friends at Harvard and they don't work nearly as hard as the average Wellesley women--we take our studies and extracurriculars a lot more seriously than they do. So don't worry too much about acceptance--it's not the hardest school to enter. :)"", ""Definitely worth the money. The Wellesley experience is incredible. Everyone works so hard--as one of the top in my state, I went to Wellesley and met girls who were the top in their respective states, and met upperclassmen who, in my eyes, were close to achieving rocker status because they had done so many lovely, cool, and commendable things. Seriously try and visit campus and meet some of the students if you can--the prospectives I met all were awed by how much they loved Wellesley and by how nice and great the students were. There is no hierarchy, belittling, or aggression between Wellesley women--just intense yet respectful competition, and it is really every woman against herself. You compete to be better than you thought you could be--if you feel stupid because everyone else around you seems uber smart, guess what? Everyone around you feels the same way. Wellesley women intimidate Wellesley women, and that makes all of us try that much harder. We know how to party, have fun, and take care of ourselves--you do NOT have to do all-nighters if you manage your time well--but we study hard and also form meaningful relationships with faculty and students that you can't get at big universities or even at such an acclaimed school as Harvard. Wellesley is great because it is small, it is all-girls, it is far enough from Boston to be a real college and campus experience but close enough that you aren't in the middle of nowhere, it really tries to meet the needs of each student, and since it is a liberal arts school, will teach you all the skills you need for success as a person, worker, boss, wife, daughter, cousin, politician, lawyer, service worker... whatever your role is!"", ""The campus is one of the most beautiful in the nation, is consistently in the top 5 liberal arts schools nationally, and of course, as an all-female school, is a haven for women! Because Wellesley is all-female, the perks of really being able to focus on school are immense. While at co-ed schools you may have to take the higher road and not talk as much in class because there are rowdy boys in the class, or have to deal with the sexism that I have encountered in many boys in my grade, at Wellesley you can be completely free to do what you want and need to do in order to perform at your peak. The small class sizes are a blessing, and being surrounded by girls makes competition and performance that much more intense yet friendly. Even if I theoretically had to leave Wellesley and go to a state university because of tuition costs, I would forever be thankful for my time at Wellesley and remember what a tremendous blessing it was to meet other women who have the same goals and aspirations as me, and who don't get distracted from their goals."", ""Wellesley is an excellent liberal arts school because, in a nutshell, they teach you how to figure the world out for yourself. They have excellence in everything: faculty, location, students, campus, dining, residential staff, dorms, comprehensive studies, major and minor flexibility, inter-college communication, etc. You're surrounded by girls who are the top in their state and have been up to the national/international level in music, the arts, sports--you name it, you have it. The Wellesley woman is a good speaker, a talented writer, not afraid to ask hard questions, intense, diligent, and a level above other college students. We put our all into not just our academics but everything else as well--while Harvard, MIT, Babson, Olin, and other schools may not work too hard on a culture festival, an orientation event, an intercollegiate party, or an open Boston forum, Wellesley women and faculty take professionalism to a completely new level. Every woman who receives an award, a distinction, an executive position in a club or otherwise, fully deserves it. At Wellesley, you're surrounded by the best of the nation--women who will be great in the future, and who will make their mark. So am I learning a lot? Yes, both in and out of class--and most likely much more out of class. The people you encounter are insanely smart, hard-working, and honest. The students at other schools provide a way for a student of Wellesley to really see the perks of Wellesley and what sets us apart from other schools, whether all-girl or not.""]]",Wellesley College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Wellesley-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/106373,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00118-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906553095,906510641,HORIZONTAL,,"{133638=Like I've said, academic life here is rigorous.

Lastly, give Wellesley a chance. A few years ago, I never would have pictured myself at a small, women's college outside of Boston, but now I would not attend anywhere else."", 'Wellesley is a private college and very expensive. Their financial aid program is fantastic, for those who make the cut-off. Unfortunately, I do not; I have found it difficult to finance my Wellesley education (I am paying for half of my tuition, room, and board). However, I have not transferred because I know that the education I am getting here is unparalleled and the bright, talented, friendly women who attend Wellesley could not be found at a school with a lower price tag.', ""Wellesley College definitely has a unique environment. With no men around, there is a distinctly different feel than co-ed campuses. However, I think this is only an advantage. I did not want to go to a women's college; when a friend (who was a sophomore at Bryn Mawr College) suggested I look at women's colleges, I quickly dismissed the idea. Now, I am very glad that I decided to come to Wellesley. Although we are a women's college, the school makes every effort to facilitate transportation into Boston, where over 60 other schools (and an array of social activities and events) await. I am on the Equestrian Team at Wellesley and have found it very open and lots of fun. My dorm hosts many parties and themed events - this year we had a Speakeasy Dinner Party/Murder Mystery and a Silent Rave party. Wellesley's traditions make each year special with events such as Flower Sunday, sophomore tree-planting, and hoop-rolling. I have made fantastic friends at school, with whom I go tunneling, play hide-and-seek in the science center, and take boats out on the lake. Becoming involved in student government and other clubs on campus, I have found that everyone at Wellesley is able to find a niche that fits their interests. My friend from Bryn Mawr described going to a women's college as a constant slumber party with your best friends; I could not agree more."", ""Wellesley College has a stellar academic reputation and it lives up to it. I have just completed my first year, but am already wowed by the intensity and quality of my classes at Wellesley. None of my classes have exceeded 35 people, the largest being Ecnomics 101 (one of Wellesley's most popular courses). My smallest class was Arabic with only 12 students (language classes at Wellesley rarely exceed 15 students). All my professors have known my name and offered personal time to help me out with any problems I may have. There are free, Wellesley-funded tutors for every subject and often student-run study groups that meet before exams and midterms. Classes are very challenging, but the school and the professors work hard to make sure that challenging does not turn into overwhelming. There is a large amount of work to be done outside of the classroom, however, it is all relevant and none of it is merely busy-work. Most classes rely heavily on discussion, and while attendance is usually not mandatory, most students come to class because the professor's lecture is worth their time. Wellesley has a liberal arts focus, so you get to take classes in all different subjects, even those with no pertinence toward your major. This is a great benefit, for you can really explore subjects you may never have been exposed to before without jeopardizing your major. I have genuinely enjoyed going to most of my classes and have very rarely skipped.""]]",Wellesley College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Wellesley-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/106373,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00118-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906553095,906510641,HORIZONTAL,,"{133638=Like I've said, academic life here is rigorous.

That doesn't mean the facilities are old--the bathrooms are pretty nice, and although some of the rooms are a bit small, you're never cramped. The dorms are split into different Houses (kind of like Harry Potter except without all the fighting), each with its own fight songs and traditions. You can be involved if you want, but there's no pressure to conform. Each floor has its own kitchen or kitchenette (depending on how big) complete with stovetop, refrigerator, and microwave. The bathrooms have individual cubbies for your toiletries, and the rooms have closets."", ""Wellesley is hard. A lot of rumors go around about grade deflation, but the truth is that the classes aren't killer, they just demand that you actually put in a huge effort--the kind of effort that teachers talked about in high school but wasn't actually necessary to get good grades. Here a B is something to be proud of, but people still get As."", ""Wellesley students are smart, yeah, but most didn't get perfect scores on their SATs or have perfect 4.0 GPAs. What Wellesley cares about is that you have the passion to go after what you want and have a love of learning. A lot of people ask about the all-girls component, to which I answer: it's not an all-girls school without men, it's an all-women college without boys (it's on a T-shirt). You get used to it very quickly. I can't exactly describe the vibe, but it really is different when there's a male in the room. Once in a while there are guys in the classes (since we can cross-register with Babson and MIT and they can come join us), but not often. I guess two main results I've seen from being surrounded by women is a feeling of siblinghood with my fellow students and a greater appreciation of what women are capable of--having female role-models doing things I'd only dreamed of has boosted my own self-confidence and gotten me to dream bigger."", ""Wellesley is, in a word, intense. The students are passionate and frequently rally around their favored causes, and they bring the same fervor to their studies along with their many extracurriculars.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""I was looking for a small school with smart and hard working students that would fuel my academic fire and that is exactly what I found at Wellesley. This school is good for students who are willing to work hard at academics. From what i've noticed, all the students are hungry for success and they are willing to pour their sweat and tears into their work to reach it. There doesn't seem to be any slacker groups of students at Wellesley, and that makes me work harder to keep up with all the rest of the students. Wellesley is also good for students who enjoy small class sizes, which allows you get to know your professors better. This past semester, class sizes for me ranged from 3 to 24, which made it easier to participate as a somebody instead of a lost number in a 100+ student class."", ""Like previous students commented, don't be afraid to apply even if you don't meet the academic standards. I for one did not completely meet the standards, but I was still accepted. Having an interview with an alumni was beneficial, I think, because I was able to show my enthusiasm in person and talk more casually about myself, interests and goals. Another tip is to think about what you would like to pursue. Even if you decide to come in undecided, you should do your homework on possible majors. Since Wellesley is a small school, the number of course offerings and majors are limited, especially for upper level language courses, so looking up majors and courses on the Wellesley website will be beneficial to see what is offered."", ""Wellesley's academics does give you a lot for your dollar because the professors are very approachable and helpful, and the courses are challenging. The support given to the individual students is very good since class sizes are intimate and I feel like that is something hard to come by. The high level of academics matches the high tuition cost, but calculated into the full attendance cost is an unusually expensive one-and-only meal plan, which makes me feel like I have to eat in the dining halls to get the most bang for my meal plan buck."", ""Wellesley feels like a girls camp where we have homework and tests. It's a calming feeling since our campus is quite nice and there are no scary/creepy men around (except during on-campus parties hahaha). I feel safe and the young women I meet are all wonderful, talented and bright, and help to create a positive learning environment. However, I give this enjoyment rating a 4/5 stars because of transportation. I hardly/never really leave the Wellesley area because it takes about 30-40min and costs around $3-5 depending on the day, time and mode of transportation (bus/Green line/commuter rail) to get into Boston."", ""A majority of things covered in class during my first semester were all new to me, so I can easily say that I am learning a lot. However, academics isn't the only thing I feel like i'm learning. The expectations at Wellesley are definitely much higher than in high school, and this makes me learn how to live effectively and efficiently. Juggling difficult schoolwork and extracurricular activities, and controlling sleeping and study habits by myself makes me feel like I can become a more independent woman by being here in this setting.""]]",Wellesley College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Wellesley-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/106373,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,6,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00118-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,906553095,906510641,HORIZONTAL,,"{133638=Like I've said, academic life here is rigorous.

We put our all into not just our academics but everything else as well--while Harvard, MIT, Babson, Olin, and other schools may not work too hard on a culture festival, an orientation event, an intercollegiate party, or an open Boston forum, Wellesley women and faculty take professionalism to a completely new level. Every woman who receives an award, a distinction, an executive position in a club or otherwise, fully deserves it. At Wellesley, you're surrounded by the best of the nation--women who will be great in the future, and who will make their mark. So am I learning a lot? Yes, both in and out of class--and most likely much more out of class. The people you encounter are insanely smart, hard-working, and honest.

But what I love the best is that there is no pressure to join things. If you would rather focus on academics everyone understands. If you would like to try out an activity, but you change your mind, that's fine too. To me, this is a wonderful improvement from the high school mentality where I felt obligated to pick an activity as a Freshman and stick with it through Senior Year. I honestly believe that there are activities for every type of person here. Some groups are casual - like getting together to watch movies every week, and some are more formal. There are also plenty of opportunities to attend lectures and events on campus. In the past month I attended a free production of a Shakespeare play by the Actors From the London Stage as well as a lecture by a post-doctorate theoretical physicist from Harvard."", ""I think that many types of students would do well at Wellesley - that being said, since I've recently been through my own college search, I would say that women looking for a studious, serious environment would enjoy Wellesley.

My current favorite walk is around Lake Waban. I love to study on the third floor of the library looking out the floor-to-ceiling window at the trees.

However, I know that I am getting the best education for me at a price comparable to other private schools.

Walk around the lake! Study! There are always things to do.', 'In my honest opinion the food is wonderful. Still, I hear plenty of students complaining. All I can objectively say is that there are plenty of options - we have multiple dining halls that cater to different tastes. I personally have no trouble finding at least one thing that I would love to eat!', ""Living away from home was my single biggest worry about college. I was disgusted by the idea of being forced to live with a stranger in a dreary, little room. However, I've learned that neither of those things are as terrible as they sound! Yes, the rooms are small. Dorm rooms are small everywhere. And honestly, I was expecting one about half the size I'm in. Here the dorms are technically called Residence Halls and they each have their own character. I like them because they are, for the most part, historic, beautiful buildings. The communal spaces are cozy and well maintained. Living in a building with women of all grade levels builds community and means that I can meet many different people."", ""The classes are hard, and the grading is harder. However, I feel that I am learning more than I ever have. While I'm still adjusting to the mindset that I am competing against myself rather than my classmates - Wellesley's Honor Code prohibits discussing grades - I think that overall this will allow me to try my hardest and learn that life is not about grades. So far I have found professors very accessible and willing to help. Although the classes are difficult and there is a lot of studying, I know that I am learning."", 'Visit!

I have just completed my first year, but am already wowed by the intensity and quality of my classes at Wellesley. None of my classes have exceeded 35 people, the largest being Ecnomics 101 (one of Wellesley's most popular courses). My smallest class was Arabic with only 12 students (language classes at Wellesley rarely exceed 15 students). All my professors have known my name and offered personal time to help me out with any problems I may have. There are free, Wellesley-funded tutors for every subject and often student-run study groups that meet before exams and midterms. Classes are very challenging, but the school and the professors work hard to make sure that challenging does not turn into overwhelming. There is a large amount of work to be done outside of the classroom, however, it is all relevant and none of it is merely busy-work. Most classes rely heavily on discussion, and while attendance is usually not mandatory, most students come to class because the professor's lecture is worth their time. Wellesley has a liberal arts focus, so you get to take classes in all different subjects, even those with no pertinence toward your major. This is a great benefit, for you can really explore subjects you may never have been exposed to before without jeopardizing your major. I have",True,0,0

I have just completed my first year, but am already wowed by the intensity and quality of my classes at Wellesley. None of my classes have exceeded 35 people, the largest being Ecnomics 101 (one of Wellesley's most popular courses). My smallest class was Arabic with only 12 students (language classes at Wellesley rarely exceed 15 students). All my professors have known my name and offered personal time to help me out with any problems I may have. There are free, Wellesley-funded tutors for every subject and often student-run study groups that meet before exams and midterms. Classes are very challenging, but the school and the professors work hard to make sure that challenging does not turn into overwhelming. There is a large amount of work to be done outside of the classroom, however, it is all relevant and none of it is merely busy-work. Most classes rely heavily on discussion, and while attendance is usually not mandatory, most students come to class because the professor's lecture is worth their time. Wellesley has a liberal arts focus, so you get to take classes in all different subjects, even those with no pertinence toward your major. This is a great benefit, for you can really explore subjects you may never have been exposed to before without jeopardizing your major. I have",True,0,0

Most Wellesley women are involved in at least one organization on campus, be it political, social, or sportive. Social life is not traditional; if you want a frat/sorority scene, you have to go out in Boston to find it. However, many other social opportunities provide for a well-rounded college experience. Tips for prospective students Wellesley is a demanding school and definitely attracts a certain kind of person; however, it also has produced the highest percentage of women in executive, high-ranking jobs. Make sure that your writing skills are up to par, as most non-science classes require a large amount of reading and writing. Talk to a current student at Wellesley, but be aware that there are many different attitudes about the school (quite a few which have to do with the fact that it is all-women).

Boston isn't so bad, but you can't go without money. If you have a job, it's not so bad. If you get a really good financial aid package, your job will let you have all the fun you want if you're careful. In terms of the EDUCATION, if you're from a low-income family, you can get a really good financial aid package. If not, I know it depends. Overall, the Wellesley education is great, IF you already come from money. Wellesley has a lot of resources to help out though."", ""Oh man. There's buses into Boston, MIT, Harvard..

You usually have to share a room for the first 2 years though."", ""Definitely what Wellesley is known for: almost killing you. But! It pays off a ton. You end up one of the best! There is no grade inflation, so if you earn a B, you get a B. You feel less bad about doing alright. The help is there if you need it. There's countless resources from office hours from professors to help rooms."", ""If you're a person of color, make sure you are comfortable with their demographics. LOOK UP THE DEMOGRAPHICS. It plays a huge role in feeling represented at Wellesley. Just because Wellesley isn't well known, it doesn't make it a bad school. It is amazing!

U.S. passport book holders may then apply for additional visa pages while the passport book is still valid. The Department of State proposes eliminating the option to add visa pages in passports beginning January 1, 2016. To help mitigate the need for visa page inserts, the Department began issuing the larger 52-page passport book in October 2014 to all overseas U.S. passport applicants at no extra cost. U.S. passport applicants applying domestically can still obtain the 52-page passport book at no extra charge by requesting it on the application form. The elimination of visa page inserts coincides with the Department's anticipated rollout of the Next Generation Passport in 2016. The Next Generation Passport incorporates new security features designed to protect the integrity of U.S. passport books against fraud and misuse. An interagency working group determined that the addition of visa page inserts could reduce the effectiveness of these new security features. If this change is implemented, the fee for this service will be removed from the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services., 7015=√Ç¬ß 2714 - Denial of passports to certain convicted drug traffickers, 5315=√Ç¬ß 1621 - Perjury generally, 11244=Title 22 published on 2015-04-01, 6823=√Ç¬ß 2671 - Emergency expenditures, 10967=Executive Order ... 11295, 8729=108 Stat. 1760, 7143=√Ç¬ß 2721 - Impermissible basis for denial of passports}","Thu, 23 Jul 2015 16:36:02 GMT","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 27856 - Passports: Official Passports for Officials or Employees of State, Local, Tribal or Territorial Governments Traveling Abroad and Carrying Out Official Duties in Support of the U.S. Government 2015-05-15; vol. 80 # 94 - Friday, May 15, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.
