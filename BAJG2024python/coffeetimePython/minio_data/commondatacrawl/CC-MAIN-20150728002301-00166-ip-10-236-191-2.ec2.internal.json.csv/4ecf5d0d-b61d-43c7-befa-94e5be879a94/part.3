There are many programs made to make campus safe and the community within the residence halls cannot be matched.', 'The classes are pretty tough at Old Dominion University, and of course there are those few easy A classes but as for the major classes, I will admit that these classes really do test your knowledge on the material and force you to learn the material in order to properly take it with you into life after college.', 'Studying is key to any college success story Finding how you study is Essential! Making many friends to help when you may not quite understand Talk to your professor if you ever get lost or need some help Seek tutoring at least a week before your exam Make a class schedule that works with your personality(morning or night person)', 'On any scale i would put Old Dominion University at the top every time without hesitation. With a growing campus that offers everything and anything any one student would need while attending school.

This is a big upgrade since prior years when incidences have happened, and there weren't many police officer around to prevent it. Now, after a certain time, if you live in a dorm, you must check-in at the main desk to verify that you live in that building. If you want to bring a friend in, you must get a guest pass prior the cut off time and they can stay the night if they'd life (male or female), but must stay with you at all times."", ""I wasn't into the Greek Life prior attending college. It didn't seem to fit the type of person I was at the time. However, now I'm researching what the sororities mean and what would best fit my personality.

I recommend going to the cheaper bookstore to get a bang for your buck, otherwise, get it online; if it's not at either, then resort to the school sponsored bookstore. Also, we have a dining place called the P.O.D where students who are on a meal plan can use their meal swipes and do a meal exchange (instead of going to the cafe, get a sub?) However, the prices for the miscellaneous items can be a bit pricey, so I recommend you get whatever you need at Wal-Mart or use your flex points if you please."", 'Of course, the party life at any college is going to be listed as fun for college students. Aside from parties, I enjoy taking naps when I can, hanging with friends, riding the bus to go to Chipotle or the Mall, and the list continues...', ""To be quite honest, I love that I have $450 flex points that I can use at Chick fil a, Pizza Hut/Wing Street, Panda Express, Starbucks, Einstein Bagels, etc. The food they have in the cafeteria isn't all that good. It's a hit or miss, which is why most students use their flex points, use their own money to eat out, or simply cook!"", ""At ODU, there is no curfew, even for freshman. I love the fact that the dorms are spread out, but not too far. The price for living in dorms are reasonable for the average student/parent's budget. The quality varies, but overall, there's a sight to see no matter where you lay your head!"", ""Thanks to blog.ratemyprofessors.com, I get the chance to see how my fellow peers rate their former teachers.

There is also an escort service that is run at night by the police and student volunteers as well as a bus system. ODU has also been in the process of buying up surrounding property that has been known to house those that have caused problems for the campus in the past.', ""In front of the student center (Webb Center) in the middle of the lawn (Kaufman Mall) is the school seal. Its said that if you step on it while you are a student you won't graduate within 4 years. The tradition is, on the day you graduate, on the walk to the Ted, your class walks across the seal!"", ""There are a ton of clubs and groups for almost anything you can imagine. We have a really nice state of the art gym that was just renovated 2-3 years ago. The Ted Constant Convocation Center always has really good concerts and comedians coming through and we have a top basketball team. We also have an amazing new football program. I'm not big into football but going to the games you can't help but get caught up in the frenzy of excitement! Plus students can get in for free! The student center has a game room and several clubs host free movie nights out on the lawn, in the various buildings, or in the Ted. Sometimes there are even free screenings of new movies!"", 'There are quite a few nice, inexpensive restaurants on campus in addition to the main cafeteria in the student center and the cafes in the dorms.

I have been into several different buildings and the rooms seem to be a decent size."", ""Most of the gen. eds. are fairly simple but once you get into your major classes the work is piled on and devotion to the subject you are studying really is required. I've taken upper level classes for my minor in business management, my foreign language requirement, and my major (history) and I've found this true in all three fields. And I've heard nothing but the same from students studying other subjects."", ""Get involved with campus life. Old Dominion is rapidly expanding and there is something for any interest.

Our community is extremely supportive of nearly everything and everybody."", 'Everyone on the administrative staff has always been incredibly helpful and knowledgable. The classes, even gen eds., are interesting and out of the 100+ credit hours I currently have taken there are only a handful of professors I would not take another class with.

As stated before, the campus is safe, however, the neighborhood to the west can get fairly rough, fairly quickly. The campus is as safe as you make it, don't go around being obnoxious, and don't go around making a scene on the edges of campus, especially the west and south ends. However, the best thing is, we have our own campus police, that have every right, asset and tool, as the regular police do. There is also a notice sent out every single time an incident is reported, be it on campus, or off near campus, involving our students or not."", ""I myself am a varsity sailor, so the activity I know the best is sailing. The sailing team is great, we are second in our conference this year and we are a highly motivated group of individuals. However, that isn't my only group. If you are on one of the sports teams, you will see a lot of each other. The sports teams are a close knit group of people that have similar goals and aspirations. The sports teams associate themselves often, and have many social gatherings, and its a fraternity, sorority or whatever one may want to call it in itself."", ""It's not Harvard, it's not Yale, it's not Boston College. The food isn't great, the sports teams don't dominate with all the best recruits, but it's a school of constant development. Sure, the school itself may be improving, it probably is, but I myself am not focused on that. The school is improving myself as a character, and that's what I care about, that's what my parents care about, that's what anyone's parents would care about, and that's what the people, however many there may be, paying the bill care about. But the main thing is, the bang for the buck is all determined by you. In my personal experience, the food just sucks and I have every intention of staying here happily."", ""Keep your door open, and socialize around the hall. That is how one will be able set up a social network early on. Sometimes people don't often open up and dislike the new environment, but there are also those that scour the halls to meet new friends. Also, there are many open fields in which two hand touch football is played as well as ultimate frisbee. But we do have our own little beach, which is nice, nothing too exciting though, and we've got a tiny park which is nice with outdoor charcoal grills and a sand pit for volleyball."", ""The food in the Whitehurst cafeteria is inconsistent, and has its moments. There is a sandwich bar that is always open, a stir fry booth open for lunch and dinner, and its one of the more healthy options. Otherwise if you take to the small buffet, your taking a chance at eating a food that doesn't taste so great. The cafeteria located in the middle of the campus known as 1201 has the same food, however, it is much, much larger, and the chances of one showing up, and wanting food that is actually being served, is much higher."", ""Dorm life is what it is, Whitehurst is not the best dorm on campus, as it is the oldest one. However, it's one of two that has a cafeteria, located right passed the main lobby. The room's walls may look like prisons at first, but they grown on you, and the RA's are quite active, always accessible and are usually quite friendly. But try and forget the prison part, and focus on your suite-mates and hall-mates, they make or break the life."", 'The academic rigor is quite high, I myself am entering my second semester after taking a set of rather easy courses. Make no mistake that easy is used in comparison to this upcoming semester, which will be filled with Chemistry and introductions to engineering.

They are thorough, and the higher you progress in the course levels, the harder and harder one must work.', ""When looking at the school, get to know the layout of the campus. It is very large, however, once you've spent a week walking the sidewalks, it becomes like the back of your palm. Take a good look at the student recreations center, it's always open with many facets to take your clouded mind to a healthier break. Also spend a little time researching the student resource center that you need, since they have one for many subjects such as math and science, chemistry, and many more."", 'Old Dominion University is a wonderful establishment that offers great things to its students, as well as their student-athletes.

About 97% of all crime is off of ODU campus and not even near campus dorms and housing. Crimes rarely happen along the food strip of Monarch Way. One key idea is to never walk Monarch Way alone at night. Police are all around campus with phones places in various spots of campus to call for them.', 'So many clubs and activities are around campus. It becomes overwhelming with how much you want to do and join around campus. The clubs change each semester with new ones coming or old ones ending.', 'Out of state students, biology majors, commuters.', 'A ODU seal is located in the center of Kaufman mall and you never step on it. Riding the lion at night and taking a photo of it is another huge event. And swimming in Whitehurst beach.', 'ODU is not as much compared to many other tuition. Do not fully rely on ODU giving many to any scholarships from themselves. Seems to be very little scholarships given to upcoming students.', 'The student activities council (SAC) provides many events on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Weekends, and especially holidays.', 'Food in the different dining halls can vary. Each dining does attempt to provide various categories of food but everything is always freshly made that day. The different dining halls have different reputations from the students. Students who live in that dorm with the dining hall or eat at the dining hall on a regular basis can give a much better opinion than a student who occasionally eats at the specific dining hall.', 'Dorm life varies on the building you live in. Whitehurst is known to be the most popular dorm but it is one of the smallest freshman dorms available. Do not base your dorm housing on what your friends push upon you. Take a decent amount of time to look through all dorm building options, look at photos, and pay attention to measurements because each dorm can extremely vary in size. Dorms with cafeterias are much of a plus for freshman students to avoid a distance walk for the Webb food centers.', ""The academic rigor truly depends on the courses you take and the professors you chose. If a professor is labeled as hard they really are not the hardest course. It is a student who didn't put full effort into the class and did not attempt to work with the professor. Old Dominion teaching staff is truly caring for their students even if it is a large lecture class. I've yet to meet a professor who hasn't been helpful or won't take time out of their day to help with course work."", ""If you are a freshman coming to Old Dominion University, really consider the Live and Learn Community housing. These programs are extremely helpful for your college major. All the professors I've had thus far ( 10 professors) have each been willing to go out of their way for their students who come to them personally for help. Some of my teachers have even given personal contacts so in further classes they are willing to help even outside of their course. The student body is always active. Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour each around noon you will not have classes and can find students playing in Kaufman Mall (open field in center of campus) playing sports or doing various activities. The student activity council (SAC) will always keep you busy each weekend so you will never get bored if you participate with groups and the SAC."", ""Old Dominion University is a diverse university with greatly open minded professors.

The cafeteria located in the middle of the campus known as 1201 has the same food, however, it is much, much larger, and the chances of one showing up, and wanting food that is actually being served, is much higher., 302328=Cafe 1201 is often hit or miss. When the food is good you will be coming back for more but, when it is bad you will be running for the hills.

It has so many exercise and weight machines. You name it, the gym has it. Classes are given FOR FREE. Tiquando, Yoga, Pilates, Zumba, and many others are available!!!!

I beg to differ. Some of the food may not be so good because it may be bland or not cooked the way you want. The only foods you may want to be more cautious about is its meat like steak and baked chicken. Other than that, the food in Cafe 1201 is pretty good (in my opinion). Besides Cafe 1201, they have in the House of Blues, Pizza Hut, Wing Street, Grille Works, Carolina Cupcakery (maybe), and the POD express. Nearby they have Quiznos and Starbucks.

Two major dining services, Legends and Cafe 1201, were initially great for expending meal plans. However, the food quickly becomes repetitive and there are only a few instances where they will completely change the selection such as theme events including International Day.

Also, ODU provides shuttles to the mall on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."", ""When it comes to food, ODU isn't the best but it's definitely not the worst. It's good food, but it's definitely not your Mom's home cooking. But, we have different restaurants on campus that accepts our meal swipes or flex points in exchange of food.

The professor are real good when it comes to helping their students. I have yet to meet a professor who is not willing to sacrifice their free-time to help a student who is having struggles in their class.

The area surrounding the school is riddled with crime and crack houses. This means that when locals attempt to go to ODU parties, and get turned away, things can get very ugly very quickly. There have been multiple shootings, assaults, robberies, and burglaries.', ""The Greek life is nothing like it is proclaimed to be. They are made out to seem like they provide family and true friendships when in reality, you're thrown into a group of friends who really have nothing in common with you. With the dues the organizations charge, the only students who can really participate are those who are privileged and have massive parental support. For those putting themselves through college there is really no way to be a part of it. Those who join Greek Life seem to be pretentious and snobby, however they do seem to advocate for it and preach that it has changed their life. However, once you look into the inner workings of Greek Life you realize that they are required to do so and it is all a giant recruitment act. Fraternities and Sororities require members to pay their dues and keep their chapter large, so recruitment is a necessity that is a lot like being a salesperson. Being in Greek life pretty much means paying for friends that have nothing in common with you, in order to maintain a sense of dominance in a social hierarchy that only makes you seem pretentious and empty. At Old Dominion specifically, Greek Life is weak compared to other larger schools, and chapters aren't allowed to have fraternity houses."", ""I am currently involved with Club Soccer and I couldn't be any more glad that I did it. I remained in touch with the sport I loved and met a lot of new friends and great people. There is a plethora of clubs ranging from sports, to academics, to hobbies, and you are sure to find a club to join with people who share similar interests."", ""If you love the beach and coastal winds, you can smell low-tide on some days. You can hear the shipyard every morning when you wake up. It's good for kids who are open-minded and like a diverse setting with a lot of African-American students. It's a good school for those who are social and like the city more than small towns."", 'If you step on the seal, you will not graduate. You must ride the lion at some point even though it is illegal. 42nd is the main party street on campus. Gresham After Dark is an extremely well kept secret.', ""Old Dominion is one of the cheapest public universities in the state. If you're in-state then it is one of the cheapest schools at less than 20,000 a year. if you live off campus and manage your money wisely, it can be affordable and one of the cheapest schools around. It is also entirely worth it to get that college experience and get the independence and freedom that comes with it."", ""The nightlife at ODU is a lot like typical college nightlife. If you like to dance you're out of luck because most parties have none. Parties are giant kickbacks with girls in tiny outfits showing off of skin, standing around drinking and talking. If you're into sports then playing pickup games is a great way to pass the time. Otherwise you will spend most time with friends on campus, or going to the beach."", 'There are many options, including popular options like Panda Express, Subway, and Chic-Fil-A. The dining halls are pretty ordinary, nothing great but much better than high school food. Theres not a whole lot of diversity but try and waste your meal swipes because you will always end up with a lot of them leftover.', ""Dorm life is a bit too expensive for what you are getting. Living in the quad is nice and while you are close to everything on campus, rent is also about 700 dollars more a year. Faulty fire alarms, lost packages, and ridiculous guest policies don't make the experience any more enjoyable. The worst downside is that you are required to get a meal plan when you live on campus and that adds on 4000 dollars for food that you never finish. Much cheaper to live off campus."", ""It's not the most rigorous school in the area that you could go to. Schools such as JMU and VT are considered to be much more challenging, however it is on par with university standards and therefor isn't a walk in the park. The work is graded much more harshly than high school."", 'There are very average prospects for being accepted into university, one of the main criteria is your GPA. Your SAT or ACT scores should also be above average. Make sure to take positions of leadership in extra-curricular activities.', ""Old Dominion is a diverse environment. It is in the middle of a very dangerous area that can easily be considered high-risk. Be prepared to work hard because with over 20,000 students, there's a lot of competition with grades.""]]",Old Dominion University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Old-Dominion-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/82796,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,233,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00166-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889095119,888924005,HORIZONTAL,,"{928640=The food in the Whitehurst cafeteria is inconsistent, and has its moments.

Our dental plans are designed to ensure you receive regular preventive care with little or no cost to you. We also provide comprehensive coverage should you need more extensive dental care. A national study by the BlueCross BlueShield Association showed a 4-8% reduction in costs when both medical and pharmacy benefits are managed together by a health plan. The result? You can save up to $15 per member per month. Our pharmacists frequently consult with member care management, in real time, while the patient is on the phone. This canÃ¢Â€Â™t happen in a carve-out PBM relationship. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, asthma and depression result in 75% of overall health care costs. Because the primary mode of treatment for these conditions is medication, the integration of pharmacy and medical care is critical to increased safety and lower costs. Savings for Employers With true medical and pharmacy benefit integration, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll keep your family and your employees safe from unexpected drug interactions. To ensure there are no potential interactions, our systems provide real-time review across the medical and pharmacy environments. With Excellus BCBS, our pharmacists see every medication that an employee is taking Ã¢Â€Â“ under both the medical and pharmacy benefits. Other Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) may say they offer integration, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s often just a claims file upload Ã¢Â€Â“ itÃ¢Â€Â™s not real-time,","* Not available in the Rochester region Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Want more information about our dental plans?

I finally decided to fix it myself. I'm glad I did. After buying a repair manual, I could see the repair would be a bit challenging. The auto parts store at the corner was asking over $200 for the part, and I'm sure the dealer would be asking well over $350. Add in labor and all the other extras they would want to charge me for (drain and flush radiator, etc.) and I anticipated the dealer charging over $600. I needed the part soon--it was getting pretty noisy and decided to quit driving the car on Wednesday. I ordered the part on Thursday afternoon. FedEx delivered it on Saturday morning. Perfect! With delivery, the fan cost me just over $100 from Go-Parts. By Saturday evening, I was back on the road. The experience could not have been any better.

Differences may arise from returns, bad product, or other sales concessions.', 'Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes.

It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size. Formula: Total Overhead Cash Expense / Net Revenues', 'Operating Profit to Sales OPERATING PROFIT TO SALESOPERATING PROFIT TO SALES is a useful ratio when evaluating value of a firm.

This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management.

Return on assets is an indicator of how profitable a company is. Use this ratio annually to compare a business performance to the industry norms: The higher the ratio the greater the return on assets. However this has to be balanced against such factors as risk, sustainability and reinvestment in the business through development costs.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages.

The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation.

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.
