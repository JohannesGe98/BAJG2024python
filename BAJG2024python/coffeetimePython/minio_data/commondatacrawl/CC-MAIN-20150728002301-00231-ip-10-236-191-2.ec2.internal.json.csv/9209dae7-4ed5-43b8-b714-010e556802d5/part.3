Your doctor will make specific recommendations, depending on your health and immunization history, areas of the country you will be visiting, planned activities and other factors.

Long-term travelers, such as those who plan to work or study abroad, may also need additional vaccinations as required by their employer or school. To have the most benefit, see a doctor at least 4-6 weeks before your trip to allow time for your vaccines to take effect. If you are leaving sooner, it is still important to see a doctor as soon as possible for vaccines, medications and information about how to protect yourself from illness and injury while traveling.

That makes waist circumference the better choice for many settings. The NursesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â„Â¢ Health Study also found that waist and waist-to-hip ratio are equally effective at predicting who was at risk of death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause. (4) Other researchers have found that waist, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI are similarly strong predictors of type 2 diabetes. (8,9) In 2007, for example, a combined analysis of fifteen prospective cohort studies found that waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference were both associated with CVD riskÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â€?and were no different from each other in predicting CVD risk. (7) Scientists have long debated which measure of abdominal fat is the best predictor of health risk: Waist size alone or waist-to-hip ratio.The research to date has been mixed. But adding up the evidence from multiple studies suggests that both methods do an equally good job of predicting health risks. Which Is Best: Waist or Waist-to-Hip? What is it about abdominal fat that makes it strong marker of disease risk? The fat surrounding the liver and other abdominal organs, so-called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“visceral fat,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã‚? is very metabolically active. It releases fatty acids, inflammatory agents, and hormones that ultimately lead to higher LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, and blood pressure.

These organizations provide health care at more than 7,500 clinical sites, ranging from large medical facilities to mobile vans.Ã‚Â  In 2008, health centers served more than 17 million medically underserved people.Ã‚Â  FQHCs provide an environment to demonstrate the benefits of medical homes can offer to Medicare beneficiaries., 78033=HRSA awarded $36 million in grants to support the operations of 53 Health Center Controlled Networks in fiscal year 2009., 81036=This demonstration will evaluate whether federal qualified health centers that deliver advanced primary care improve access and quality, promote appropriate use of services, and reduce health care costs.Ã‚Â  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will begin soliciting applications in spring 2010, aiming to begin implementation of the 3-year demonstration initiative in January 2011.Ã‚Â  CMS will conduct an independent evaluation of this demonstration.}",,"FIP grants are listed below.Ã‚Â  They were awarded through a competitive process: HRSA has received a total of $2 billion through the Recovery Act to expand health care services to low-income and uninsured individuals through its health center program. To date, nearly $1.9 billion of these funds have been awarded to community-based organizations across the country. Ã¢Â€ÂœBecause community health centers already provide comprehensive health care to people who face the greatest barriers to accessing care, these demonstration projects have the potential to support and improve the care delivered not only to Medicare beneficiaries, but also to others who rely on community health centers for primary care,Ã¢Â€? said HHS Secretary Kathleen G. Sebelius. This model, known as the Ã¢Â€Âœmedical home,Ã¢Â€? promotes accessible, continuous, and coordinated family-centered care.Ã‚Â  Developed and administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the demonstration will last three years.Ã‚Â  CMS anticipates that up to 500 health centers will participate. President Obama directed the Department of Health and Human Services to implement a demonstration initiative designed to evaluate the impact of the advanced primary care practice model on access, quality and cost of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries served by community health centers. Both programs will be administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Ã‚Â  The new Recovery Act funds are the latest in a series of grants awarded to community health centers, which deliver preventive and primary care services at more than","FACT SHEET Community Health Centers and the Recovery Act Health centers deliver preventive and primary care services at more than 7,500 service delivery sites around the country to patients regardless of their ability to pay; charges for services are set according to income.Ã‚Â  Health centers serve more than 17 million patients, about 38 percent of whom have no health insurance. Three sets of health center awards have already been funded through Recovery Act appropriations on the following dates: On March 2, President Obama announced grants worth $155 million to establish 126 new health center sites.Ã‚Â  Those grants will provide access to essential preventive and primary health care for more than 750,000 people in 39 states and two territories. On March 27, HHS also awarded $338 Million in Increased Demand for Services grants for health centers. Health centers are using these funds to provide care to more than 2 million additional patients over the next two years, including approximately 1 million uninsured people. In addition, over the next two years, health centers will use the funds to create and retain approximately 6,400 health center jobs. On June 29, First Lady Michelle Obama announced the release of $851 million in Recovery Act grants to upgrade over 1,500 health center sites and open their doors to more patients.Ã‚Â  More than 650 centers will use the funds for health information technology (HIT) systems, and nearly 400 health centers will adopt and expand the use of electronic health records.
