MS1, MS2 and MS3 all have internal 100kÃÂ© pull-down resistors. For the microstep modes to function correctly, the current limit must be set low enough (see below) so that current limiting gets engaged. Otherwise, the intermediate current levels will not be correctly maintained, and the motor will effectively operate in a full-step mode. Stepper motors typically have a step size specification (e.g. 1.8Ã‚Â° or 200 steps per revolution), which applies to full steps. A microstepping driver such as the A4983 allows higher resolutions by allowing intermediate step locations, which are achieved by energizing the coils with intermediate current levels. For instance, driving a motor in quarter-step mode will give the 200-step-per-revolution motor 800 microsteps per revolution by using four different current levels. Step (and microstep) size Warning: Connecting or disconnecting a stepper motor while the driver is powered can destroy the driver. (More generally, rewiring anything while it is powered is asking for trouble.) Four, six, and eight-wire stepper motors can be driven by the A4983 if they are properly connected; a FAQ answer explains the proper wirings in detail. Motor connections The driver requires a logic supply voltage (3 Ã¢Â€Â“ 5.5Ã‚Â V) to be connected across the VDD and GND pins and","Control inputs Each pulse to the STEP input corresponds to one microstep of the stepper motor in the direction selected by the DIR pin. Note that the STEP and DIR pins are not pulled to any particular voltage internally, so you should not leave either of these pins floating in your application. If you just want rotation in a single direction, you can tie DIR directly to VCC or GND. The chip has three different inputs for controlling its many power states: RST, SLP, and EN. For details about these power states, see the datasheet. Current limiting To achieve high step rates, the motor supply is typically much higher than would be permissible without active current limiting. For instance, a typical stepper motor might have a maximum current rating of 1Ã‚Â A with a 5ÃÂ© coil resistance, which would indicate a maximum motor supply of 5Ã‚Â V. Using such a motor with 12Ã‚Â V would allow higher step rates, but the current must actively be limited to under 1Ã‚Â A to prevent damage to the motor. The A4983 supports such active current limiting, and the trimmer potentiometer on the board can be used to set the current limit. One way to set the current limit is to put the driver into full-step mode and to measure the current running through a single motor coil without clocking the STEP input. The measured current will be 0.7 times the current limit (since both coils are always on and limited to 70% in",True,3,0,{27354=Ã‚Â© 2001Ã¢Â€Â“2015 Pololu Corporation},,
