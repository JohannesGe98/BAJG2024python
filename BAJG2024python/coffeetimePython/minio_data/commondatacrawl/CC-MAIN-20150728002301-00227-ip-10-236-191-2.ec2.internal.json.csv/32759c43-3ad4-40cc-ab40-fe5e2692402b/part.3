The classes aren't easy and there are lots of big lecture hall type classes so studying outside of class is crucial. They provide lots of academic help and resources including tutoring which I have taken advantage of."", ""A study tip that I would recommend to students is to really know the information. Do not just memorize formulas and definitions-really learn and be able to apply them. Many of your classes are built on each other so just passing by in one class could really hurt you when it's actually a foundation for another few classes. Depending on your personality, it may also help to find friends that take the same classes as you. I tend to do better in classes that I take with my friends because not only can I study with them and have another reference to go to if I don't understand something, but it really motivates me to do well because when we're comparing grades after exams and such it's almost like a contest to see who can get a better grade. Also, it's okay to get a tutor for classes that you struggle with. I usually do well with school and was embarrassed to get a tutor at first, but once I got one for a class that I really didn't understand it made a huge difference and I am so glad that I did. Something important that I've learned through experience that I would tell to students is to get to know your professors. It may seem kind of awkward, but it makes a huge difference. I go to a large university and a lot of my classes are large lecture halls, so it takes effort to communicate with professors. Visiting your professor during their office hours and not being afraid to email them will make you more comfortable with them and when they see you making an effort they will be more willing to help you. Sitting in the first few rows and participating in class is another tip that I would give. ItÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â¢Ãƒ\x82?Ãƒ\x82?s much easier to pay attention in class and retain information when youÃƒ\x83Ã‚Â¢Ãƒ\x82?Ãƒ\x82?re actively engaged and a lot of the information is given during lectures that you may not be able to find in your books. Going to class is crucial to your learning. Also, keep an open mind because there are so many different options in the business school and if you are set on just one major or just one career you may miss out on greater opportunities."", ""Iowa State University has a beautiful campus, friendly students, and a great faculty. They provide lots of extra curricular activities and opportunities to get involved for every interest imaginable, and if you're interest isn't available than starting a club is easy and manageable.

If you want, the ISU Police can give you a ride back home. There are also emergency buttons on campus, but not enough for you to think, Wow, this campus is dangerous. But really, Iowa State is pretty harmless in my experience."", ""There are limitless opportunities to join something -- or create your own club!

But really, you can join anything from the Quidditch Club to the American Sign Language Club. Just have fun and get involved!"", 'College is what you make of it. If you always go to class and try to meet new people and get involved, Iowa State is definitely worth the money. The biggest pros for me have been networking opportunities and work experience within my major. My major is JLMC, so working at the Iowa State Daily shows me what to expect for a career. I also have countless opportunities to meet industry professionals, who could potentially offer me internships in the future.', 'Just hanging out with people you meet in college has been the most fun for me. Go out to dinner with some friends, or go to ISU AfterDark (which is awesome) to play some bingo and win free stuff. Or go to the Workspace to learn a new craft. You can pretty much find anything fun on campus if you read the colored posters hung up everywhere. (:', ""One word: Panda. You can use Dining Dollars or cash, but it's delightful. Beware of lines, though, as I'm not the only one who thinks Yum about Panda. Seasons, in my opinion, is the best dining center on campus -- Conversations being a close second. They're both in the MWL-Richardson Court area, and have the best food...ever."", 'Everyone should experience dorm life their first year. For me, I was so busy with work and other activities, I only slept in my room. My dorm always had big activities going on, and my floor usually had some family time activities, too. If you have time and are outgoing, dorm life is a great way to meet people outside your major.', ""Depending on your major, the curriculum might be no sweat -- in my experience, it's those gen. eds that'll get you. Talk with your advisor and students who've taken those classes to see if you'd get anything out of the class. If you can't or if it's not interesting, DON'T take it."", ""1. Get to know your advisors: They're the ones who'll make sure you graduate on time. Depending on your major, they'll know what classes might be of interest to you. 2. At the end of a semester, go on a campus food crawl with your friends. Any extra dining dollars or meal plans you didn't use will disappear at the end of the school year, so you lost that money. Plan out a day during Finals Week with your pals and jump around to all the food-offering places on campus. You spend time with friends before summer and get your money's worth. 3. Join a student publications. You don't have to be a JLMC/advertising/PR major to do it. I know aerospace engineers who photograph for the Iowa State Daily. Joining is fun, and you meet tons of people. You might even get paid, depending on the publication and position. It's also a great resume-builder."", ""ISU is a beautiful campus with wonderfully diverse students. There are many opportunities to succeed, both in and out of the classroom.

There are all kinds of big events that happen, like E-Week or VEISHEA (if you don't know about VEISHEA yet, Google it), but there are also plenty of small ones. Whether you collect famous toothbrushes or like smashing computers to bits, you can find a student organization to share your passion with others. In short, it's hard not to enjoy Iowa State. Am learning a lot You learn a lot in college, but at Iowa State you can learn anything you could imagine. The professors are true experts in their fields, and do an excellent job teaching.

However, this year my dorm got some new furniture and new mattresses so that was very beneficial! The CA's (community advisors) that I've met so far are all wonderful.

And as long as you leave your door open to invite people to come in, you'll make lots of friends."", ""Some classes are tough and some are not so tough. I'm in a science based major so I have lots of science courses but those aren't so hard for me because that's what I'm good at. Iowa State is obviously not Harvard, but it's not a small community college either, so it's about middle of the road for academic rigor. If you're looking to challenge yourself however, the Honors Program is absolutely wonderful! You can take honors classes or add honors components to regular classes."", ""Make sure you join a learning community here! They're a great way to get to know other students in your field of study. I'm actually in two of them because they're so neat! When you come here, get the MyState app. I believe it's free (I don't have a smartphone) but it has everything from a map of campus to bus routes to when a clothes washer is available. Get you application in as early as possible! And then get your housing contract in as soon as possible too! Then you can be somewhere where you want to live instead of somewhere you don't.

The classes push you to get that A and an A is not average...A is extra and beyond the stars. As a freshman, it's okay if you gather C's when you were an A straight student. Just learn what each professor wants from you, target each class with a strategy, and have faith in yourself.

Iowa State is an alcohol-free campus as well, and most dorms have a no-drug policy as well. The accommodations made between drivers, the buses, and pedestrians are also well kept. As far as all of that goes, I don't see any inherent danger on campus at all."", ""I don't know much about greek life, but of the people I know who are involved, most people really enjoy it. They take pride in helping the community and involving themselves in all things Iowa State."", 'There is something for everyone. Like space? Join Iowa State Space Society, whether you like building rockets or just looking through a telescope. Like martial arts? There is judo, kung fu, and kendo, and more. There are various clubs for politics, and some for hobbies. And they all make it really simple to join up and to join up as many as you want.', ""You don't have to be social or outgoing, but you definitely will be. If you're the kind of person who wants professors that aren't boring, classes that challenge you, clubs that keep you interested, and peers that you will enjoy spending all your leftover time with, Iowa State should be in consideration for you."", 'Campaniling is sort of a rite of passage for Iowa Staters. To become an Iowa Stater, you have to kiss someone at midnight underneath the clock tower on the campanile. Another tradition is the zodiac in Memorial Union, the building on campus for our bookstore and other things. If you step on the zodiac on accident, it is common superstition to believe you will fail your next exam. But tossing a coin in the fountain outside will negate that effect.', ""Iowa State as a whole, is not an entirely expensive school to go to. The experience you get, in my personal opinion, is worth way more. There are so many people to meet not just from Iowa, but from everywhere in the world. I roomed with international students on 2 different occasions (and other people I knew as well), and both from different countries. It's fantastic to learn not just from professors or classes, but from your peers as well. The rooming, dining, and Main Street in their entirety, are fantastic considering the tuition."", ""There are plenty of clubs to join and events to go to, with Clubfest showing students what they should join to enhance their ISU experience. There is usually always something fun going on in Howe Hall, the engineering building. They have flight contests at the end of the semester for Aerospace Engineers and it's really fun to watch no matter what major you are in. Then there is VEISHEA, held annually at Iowa State, which is an old traditional celebration at ISU that showcases many of the things ISU has to offer, including sports, food, and other entertainment."", ""It's really hard to find a bad dining hall on-campus. Some of them are really fancy and the food is always really good, with special treats always around during the holidays. The meal plan/contracts that you have to set up depending on the dorms are really straightforward and easy to fit to each student's preferences."", 'One of the flagships for Iowa State. Most dorms are really nice, and the apartments even better. I have yet to meet anyone who dislikes who they are rooming with, and everyone is eager to meet up with everyone else. The Residential and Community Advisors there also do a good job of making sure everything runs smoothly for students/residents.', ""No class is easy, and they shouldn't ever be. However, there is a limit to having a challenging course. Being a challenging course that promotes education and learning is different from being a stressful course with a workload that makes no sense to you. Luckily, I haven't encountered the latter course and every course and professor makes it a point to highlight resources for you to use without babying you. It is a considerable step up."", 'Definitely take the Career Path survey in your first semester. It really helps get your head on straight to learn the skills you need to survive college and be successful. Talk with everyone and try to collect as much information you can about literally everything.', 'Iowa State is a fantastic place to be, not just for the beautiful campus there but for the people there too. Everyone there is really open and social and it feels like everyone is looking out for each other. The professors and other administrators are all also involved and make you feel like being an Iowa State student actually matters to them.']]",Iowa State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Iowa-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/104256,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,233,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00227-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893771359,893571667,HORIZONTAL,,"07/19/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 27 out of 28 people found this review useful. 1 of 266 Jennifer from Shoreview, MN Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

In order for a girl to be considered a true Iowa Stater, she must kiss at midnight under the campanile. Mass campaniling happens at homecoming and veisha. Also at homecoming and veisha, there are cheap pancakes on central campus. this draws a big crawd, as the pancakes are very good, and a very cheap midnight snack. Another tradition to become a true Iowa Stater involves Lake Laverne, the lake on campus. It is said that if you and your love can walk around the lake three times, without saying a word to each other, you are meant to be.', 'Every weekend Iowa State hosts a movie in one of the buildings that is free for students and their guests. Thursday through Sunday twice a night a movie that has just been released will play with no cost to anyone. there are always frat houses that throw parties on weekends, and most of the time one can find a party in the dorms as well. There are cable hookups in every dorm room, so if you feel like staying in, and have a TV, that is another option. If you are over 21, campustown is a good place to go wander, as there are a ton of bars and parties there. The cyride, with all its many routes, can take you pretty much anywhere in the city, so the possibilities are endless.', 'The food at Iowa State is delicious. Sometimes it gets pretty repetative, but overall there are enough choices that it is easy to avoid eating something if you dont want it. The dining centers are all-you-can-eat, making it easy to overeat and try some of everything. All dining centers are situated so that they are near the dorms, an easy two minute walk to the closest one.The cafes around campus are also deliciuos, as they serve the same hot food that the dining centers do. The cafes main focuses are on coffee and desserts such as cookies and brownies, so it is wise to go to a cafe for a sweets craving rather than go to a dining center.', 'Everyone tries to be very social at the beginning of the semester, by leaving their doors open and walking around the halls talking to random people. If you are a social being yourself, or do not have many friends, this may help your transition to college. Once everyone is settled in, people start forming their cliques and thats when big gettogethers start happening in random rooms. Every dorm is close to a dining center, and it is very easy to grab some friends from down the hall and go grab a meal.', 'Depending on how passionate a person is about their topic of study, the classes here can be either super hard, if you dont care, or super easy, if you love the topics. Lecture classes are a lot easier to skip than some of the smaller classes, butsome of the lectures may be more interesting and/or easier to understand the professor.', ""If high school was a walk in the park for you, make sure that after your first couple weeks, you buckle down and focus on studying, because you wont make it through the semester otherwise. It is ok to go out every so often, go to parties, go out to eat, make sure everyone else knows you're still alive. Just make sure its not every night, because that will mess with your studies. Remind yourself what your prioreties are at school. is it to spend all your money on alcohol or school supplies? or your time on a job or being the social butterfly everyone knew you as in high school? set your prioreties straight and you will succeed, no matter what school you are at."", 'The campus is gorgeous, and the atmosphere is one that makes you feel at home while still feeling like its a school.

There are all kinds of big events that happen, like E-Week or VEISHEA (if you don't know about VEISHEA yet, Google it), but there are also plenty of small ones. Whether you collect famous toothbrushes or like smashing computers to bits, you can find a student organization to share your passion with others. In short, it's hard not to enjoy Iowa State.

Liking the outdoors is a must. Also must be okay with a more isolated school and less of the popular night life"", ""KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE COUNSELORS. Since the very beginnings of my college search, Juniata has stood out as being the most personable and friendly with the admission process. My counselor, Josh, has been in touch with me since my junior year, and has helped answer my questions. While that should be standard, Juniata's done more. I've gotten a personal phone call from a Juniata student who wanted to check in on my college searching and see if I had any questions. Josh has also sent me local articles on things I might find interesting about the school. Even my acceptance letter felt handwritten. They take a very personal interest in potential students, just enough that you feel important to them, without being spammy and obnoxious. I also recommend the Open House events, or just visiting in general. (Plus, if you visit or apply online, there's no application fee!)"", ""I think so. The high price might be intimidating, as it is with private schools, but JC is one of the most generous with merit aid I've seen. I received a Quinter Scholarship (which is now $18,000 and requires a 3.75 weighted GPA), so I feel much better about the price tag. No matter what the cost, though, Juniata's a solid place to go."", ""Many people complain that small schools have less of a social life, and that getting to know everyone so quickly is boring. But if you're like me, somewhat introverted but still social, the balance is perfect. I don't need a good party scene to be happy--I'd much rather be kayaking on the river (looks like fun!), hiking or just relaxing somewhere. It sounds like a very friendly place overall, and though there's no nightclubs (oh, darn), there's still plenty to do. Huntingdon's a nice little town, and if you really want something bigger, Altoona and State College are just a (perilous) hour's drive away."", ""I'm looking to major in Biology, and this looks like a great place to go for it. The program is very diverse, and surprisingly varied for a school of its size. I haven't gotten to sit in on classes (I've been accepted, and they're at the top of my list right now, but I haven't made the final visit yet) but they have a lot of interesting offerings for such a small place. Particularly, their Biology department covers everything from Virology to Ecology, including some wild-cards like Herpetology (would so take that class if I go there!) and Glassblowing (it's not just for artists, but chemistry as well).""]]",Juniata College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Juniata-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/23741,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00227-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893823583,893780053,HORIZONTAL,,"03/02/2011 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

There are also numerous music groups, art clubs, role-playing and gaming groups, and various field-trips and out-door activities available year-round for those who are interested. Some of my personal favorites include playing club Frisbee, touring in Ireland with Concert Choir, helping to sew costumes for various theater productions, and organizing events with the Alumni Association."", 'Juniata is a community of all kinds of people, but I think the students who like it best are those who want to learn, socialize, and be active in a variety of different disciplines. Many students create study programs that allow them to take classes in a variety of departments, and most are also involved in sports, music groups, and other extra-curricular clubs and activities.', ""There are so many traditions at Juniata! For Mountain day (which is different every year), classes get cancelled and everyone goes to Raystown lake for a fun-filled day of games, activities, and food. Then there's Pigroast, Lobsterfest, Madrigal dinner and dance, Storming of the Arch, Mr. Juniata Competition, and more. Inbound, the number one freshmen transition into life at Juniata is a great way to start the school year."", 'Juniata, being a private school, is definitely not cheap. But it offers a variety of merit and need-based scholarships, along with various payment plans that help to make it a feasible investment for families of all income backgrounds.', ""Juniata is located in Huntingdon, a small town in the middle of nowhere in central PA. Being about 30 minutes from State College (driving), there are places to go shopping, but if you don't have a car, it's a little hard to get anywhere on your own. Huntingdon does have some neat little shops, bars, cafes, and an old movie theatre. Since I was so busy last year on campus, I didn't miss not being close to a large city. There was so much to do through the clubs that I was part of, and I had fun organizing my own parties and events as well."", ""There are a few choices for dining on-campus, besides cooking your own food. Baker is the main cafeteria, which offers standard food, such as pizza, grilled food, a home-cooked line, salad bar, and the local, organic option offered 3 days per week. Otherwise, there's 3 other venues where meal exchange is possible for take-out, or you can buy Starbucks coffee, snacks, sandwiches, fruits, etc. with DCB or cash."", ""Dorms, from the standard doubles to quads, apartments, and off-campus housing, are generally pretty decent. Freshmen are mostly housed together, sophomores often live in East, Lesher (the all-girls' dorm), or South, while Juniors and Seniors are given a greater variety of options such as living off-campus. All dorms are equipped with cooking, laundry, and lounge facilities. The dorms that I spent time in were all pretty pleasant and clean (though this sometimes varied dramatically depending on the occupants). The rooms had big windows, good closet spaces, and were generally furnished well."", ""Juniata's Bachelor of Science programs demand classes that aren't easy, like Organic Chem, but most of the professors are more than happy to help out. Art and Humanities classes aren't easy either, but as long as you are focused in class and stay on top of your work, the academic stress is definitely manageable."", ""Don't be afraid to try new things or to ask questions. Find your passion(s), be dedicated, stay busy, and you'll have a blast! Also, keep a good balance between your academics and social activities. Leave time to relax and have fun on the weekends, but stay on top of your workload."", ""Juniata is a perfect school if you like knowing students and professors on campus. It is small (about 1,600 students), with challenging professors, who love what they teach, and provide a learning environment that is both challenging and lots of fun. Their's always something to do outside of class, with a community of people who support whatever it is that you are passionate about.""]]",Juniata College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Juniata-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/23741,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00227-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893823583,893780053,HORIZONTAL,,"03/02/2011 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Pink and East Houses are mainly where the parties are. They can get pretty rowdy, but everyone has fun as far as I know."", ""Okay, campus food: You will likely get bored after a while. There are two eateries, Baker Refectory and Eagles Landing (which everyone on campus calls Muddy). Baker has lots of options, from pizza to classics to an exhibition line where they cook more specialized foods. There's a vegan area as well, and I believe there are gluten-free options available. On weekend mornings, Baker is the only eatery available, where they do brunch. (If you're going to the omelet line, be ready to wait, as it gets long! The cook makes six at a time, so the wait isn't too bad.) Muddy is kind of like a food court at the mall with different areas catering to different tastes (asian, grill, mexican, salads, and a sandwich line like Subway). The food here is available for meal exchange, and you usually get two or three options per line. The food up here is better than that in Muddy, but you have to be careful about not getting meal exchange items during their scheduled times: For that, you have to pay. I'm hooked on the make-your-own stir fry line in Muddy. I have to pay for it each time, but they're not stingy with the portions and it's worth it. There are places to eat in town--Boxers and OIP are great! There's also a Sheetz only a few blocks away for ready-made food and a Weis if you want to pick up ingredients or frozen foods to cook."", ""I've lived in two dorms so far, the third floor of Terrace and the second floor of Lesher (the all-girls dorm). The rooms in Lesher seem much larger; the closet and mirror spaces are definitely twice as large as the spaces in Terrace. TnT (That's Tussey 'n' Terrace) are a bit farther away from other points on campus (with the exception of East Houses, which are WAY off compared to everything else), but right across the street from the ceramics studio. Both rooms I lived in were great; there weren't any problems that were so terrible that I wanted to leave."", ""Don't come here expecting to breeze through! This is not a school where you can just sit back and walk out with high grades. I've attended Juniata for one year so far, and several teachers had attendance rules where you'd lose points if you were excessively absent. Basically, come to class, put effort into your work, and you'll be fine. Talk to your professors if you're struggling. They are willing to work with you."", ""Be prepared to work.

Overall the rooms are bigger than the average dorm room and the views vary from blocked windows to a nice view of the campus.

The dorms are pretty clean, even the bathrooms you almost always share by floor. They have reasonable and enforced quiet hours.', 'As with any school, how much work you will have and how many credits you will be required depends greatly on the major you choose. Comparing with friends attending other institutions (both public and private) Juniata has a higher work load and the classes are much harder. On the other hand, I had a better understanding of subjects and overall enjoyed my classes more since the Professors were both the ones that were teaching us and very engaging.', 'Juniata is a great school that I highly recommend! School is taken very seriously here and it will take some time to adjust, there will be work! Just stay on top of things and you will be fine. The people here are great! Keep your mind open, without a doubt Juniata will change your perspective on life.', 'Juniata has the most inspiring population (speaking about both students and staff). Great small school experience, you are always taught by a professor and never competing with graduate students for special opportunities.

Students trust the system enough to leave backpacks and laptops out in public areas unattended without fear. The campus really feels like a family, rather than just different people living close together. That's the thing about a small campus, it has to be that way to work."", ""There are no frats or sororities on campus... officially at least. The club sports teams sort of take that place, but parties are mostly contained to the upperclassmen dorms of East on Saturday nights and are nondiscriminatory. If someone wants to party, they definitely have the opportunity, but parties at Juniata are also easy to avoid for anyone who doesn't want to be involved."", 'Student run organizations are a big deal on campus. A big festival called Lobsterfest introduces them all to students during the first few weeks and students are free to choose what to participate in from sports to comic books to environmental coalitions. The variation is incredible.', ""Students that want their professors to actually know their names, students that want small classes, students that want to travel or study abroad, and students that want to embrace diversity and get to know the people at their school on a personal level would love Juniata. The college's international and study abroad programs are unmatched in participation and provide great opportunities for students!"", ""On the secret unannounced mountain day students on the activity board are called and provided air horns at 5am to wake all the students on campus. Classes, meetings, and jobs are cancelled for the day and the school hosts a huge number of activities on campus for students and faculty to get outdoors and enjoy the good weather. Mountain day is 'always tomorrow' until it actually happens!!!"", 'Juniata College is small and private, so it is very expensive but holds the potential for great scholarships and huge reductions in cost based on both academics and financial need. The education offered by this institution is well worth the price, and they work to get scholarships, jobs, and internships for any student who expresses interest.', 'Outdoorsmen and the environmentally inclined will love the numerous hiking trails, walking/running paths, and cliffs within a ten minute walk of campus. The nearby Juniata river provides an opportunity for many recreational activities. Raystown lake is about 20 minutes away, and Juniata offers free kayak, canoe, and watersport equipment rentals to students and faculty. Monthly bus trips take students to State College (40 minutes away) on weekends for shopping, etc and many students carpool to tailgate or go to football games. There are local caves that offer tours as well. Juniata also provides many on-campus activities such as movies on the grass, concerts, game nights, etc to bring people together on weekends and evenings.', ""Dining services at Juniata College are provided by the food company Sodexo. There is great variation in the buffet-style dining area. The pizza and pasta line, sub line, self-created stir fry, and grill area always offer varied options (including vegan, etc) to accommodate each student's needs. Various food areas around campus offer meal exchange that allows students to grab quick meals between classes without crossing campus and counts them on their meal plan like a normal meal. Dining hours can be inconvenient for some sports teams and depending on how students schedule, but the school is good at leaving doors open for specific teams and events as they learn of schedule conflicts."", ""Juniata College dorms are, well, college dorms. Our dorms are clean and well maintained, but everybody wants more space. The dorms are a little overcrowded this year, forcing some groups to triple in a room meant for two, but a new super eco-conscious dorm building is being constructed to alleviate this over crowding. Dorm goers in different buildings have different levels of social interaction, but overall dorms are easy to travel between and are generally clean. Each student's gold card / ID will swipe them into any dorm building at any time of day or night, which is a luxury. Individual room doors have manual keys, which just means student's can't accidentally shut themselves out of the room!"", ""Juniata's Program of Emphasis approach to Majors makes everything highly individualized and open to manipulation by students if they so choose. The courses here involve the same standard amount of work as courses at other colleges would, but Juniata also offers many less traditional courses (such as classes on Field Research where students travel across the country and do field research in the desert for credit). Each student can decide what he or she can handle and wants to be involved in, whether traditional or not, and course loads are manageable to encourage students to participate in Juniata's many extracurricular activities."", ""Prospective students really need to visit the campus and sit in on classes while students are here to understand if Juniata College is going to be the right fit. The atmosphere of the campus, students, and faculty is one thing unique to this school and is either a hit or miss with many people. The small highly personalized classes and Programs of Emphasis (POE's, comparable to majors) are things that students really need to experience and hear about first hand from students to understand their uniqueness and significance in higher education."", 'Juniata College has a small town big community feel that is comfortable and relaxed. This college is relatively small, but provides large opportunities particularly through stellar academics and a strong push to travel and expand upon the curriculum outside the classroom setting. Faculty, staff, and community members are very approachable and make this campus feel like one big family.']]",Juniata College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Juniata-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/23741,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,33,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00227-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,893823583,893780053,HORIZONTAL,,"03/02/2011 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.
