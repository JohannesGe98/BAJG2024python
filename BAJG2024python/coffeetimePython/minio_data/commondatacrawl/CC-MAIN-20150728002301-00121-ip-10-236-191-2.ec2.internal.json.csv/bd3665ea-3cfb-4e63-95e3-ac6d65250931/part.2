Attachment 2 to the SILO letter states that the taxpayer must provide a list of all transactions Ã¢Â€Âœthat are the same as or substantially similar to those described in Notice 2005-13 for which losses or deductions were claimed in any taxable year.Ã¢Â€? It is not clear which transactions will be considered substantially similar to the SILO transactions described in Notice 2005-13. Notice 2005-13 identifies as a SILO a transaction that includes (1) a tax indifferent entity (e.g., foreign corporation or governmental body), (2) economic defeasance of rent and purchase option price, and (3) limited risk of loss or profit due to change in value of leased property. Does the inclusion or absence of any one particular item above affect whether a transaction is considered a SILO? For example, would a transaction with a U.S. corporate lessee that is liable for U.S. income tax at the time of the transaction be treated as a SILO? Would a transaction that does not have economic defeasance (or includes only partial economic defeasance) be treated as a SILO? If a taxpayer excludes a transaction from a settlement agreement because of a reasonable belief that the transaction is not a SILO, what would be the consequences if the Service contends that the transaction should be treated as a SILO?}",,

The deemed termination gain will be recognized in the taxpayerÃ¢Â€Â™s 2008 tax return., 100423=Interest would not be imposed on any underpayment relating to OID not reported prior to 2008., 100262=If OID from previous years is reported in 2008, would interest be imposed on any underpayment on the pre-2008 OID?, 99307=a.Ã‚Â Is the Taxpayer expected to report the OID with its original 2007 tax return?, 63776=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Plus 100% of 2009 OID, 66150=If there is an Actual Termination after December 31, 2010, the Taxpayer will report 100% of OID after 2008 through the Actual Termination date.Ã‚Â  If there is an Actual Termination after December 31, 2010, no gain or loss will be recognized., 95613=If there is no Actual Termination by December 31, 2010, then 100% of OID accrued on a year by year basis will be recognized as income in each year until there is an Actual Termination or the EBO date. No gain and/or loss will be recognized for tax purposes with respect to transactions terminated after December 31, 2010 for purposes of this initiative, provided the transaction is not amended in any way after the taxpayer agrees to accept the Initiative. Thus, OID accruing after December 31, 2010 will not be included in any tax basis calculations., 69862=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Less: 20% of Pre- 2006 Net Income/Loss ($42,800,000 *Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  20%), 57363=First, the Taxpayer would compute its Deemed Termination in 2008. Assume the following:, 95332=According to the offering, if there is no Actual Termination by December 31, 2010, then 100% OID applies for each subsequent year.Ã‚Â  Will OID accrued after 12/31/10 be included in basis?, 49237=The transaction is deemed to terminate at December 31, 2008.Ã‚Â  Rent payments and terms of all operative documents would be disregarded after December 31, 2008.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Only OID would be reported going forward until actual termination.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  The Initiative anticipates the exercise of the EBO.Ã‚Â , 93946=Is cumulative OID (accrued through 2007) included in 2008 income?, 93510=If the Taxpayer has an Actual Termination during the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010, the Taxpayer receives basis for 100% of the OID reported during such period until the year of Actual Termination.Ã‚Â , 51944=The value of the equity defeasance account would be the accreted value based on the OID calculations as of December 31, 2008., 45001=The difference will not be recovered if there is an Actual Termination after December 31, 2010., 54816=a.Ã‚Â Does Ã¢Â€Âœtax years through 2007Ã¢Â€? mean Ã¢Â€Âœtax years through September 30, 2008Ã¢Â€??Ã‚Â Ã‚Â , 100730=Does the settlement proposal require taxpayers to include OID for closed years in 2008 as well as for open years?Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â , 55511=c.Ã‚Â Does the deemed termination date of December 31, 2008 mean September 30, 2009Ã¢Â€??, 100943=Yes, OID must be included for closed years in 2008.Ã‚Â , 53326=What is the tax consequence if the Actual Termination Gain on an actual termination after 2008 but before 2011 is more than the Deemed Termination Gain?Ã‚Â The attachment only speaks to the situation where Actual Termination Gain is less than Deemed Termination Gain., 64841=In this example the Actual Termination in 2010 resulted in a loss of $3,400,000.Ã‚Â  The Taxpayer can claim an ordinary loss in the amount of $3,600,000 (the difference between the Deemed Termination Gain of $200,000 and the Actual Termination Loss) on its 2010 tax return.Ã‚Â  The Taxpayer would calculate its 2010 ordinary loss from the Actual Termination of this transaction as follows:, 84948=See calculation of Actual Termination Gain/(Loss) in Example 4.20 and the comparison of the Actual Termination Gain/(Loss) to the Deemed Termination Gain/(Loss).Ã‚Â  The OID recognized in income in 2009 is added to the basis to determine the Actual Termination Gain/(Loss) in 2010., 71216=This EBO gain/(loss) would be compared with the gain/(loss) as originally calculated and an adjustment made in the 2006 return.Ã‚Â , 99986=The settlement initiative does not require the taxpayer to file an amended return to report OID on its 2007 return., 74171=Assume that the Taxpayer from Example 4.20 actually terminated on December 31, 2010 and incurred additional transaction costs of $1,000,000 on the termination.Ã‚Â  The Actual Termination Gain/(Loss) is calculated as follows:, 62923=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Less: 20% of Pre- 2008 Net Income/Loss Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  ($101,000,000 * 20%), 82158=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Less: 20% of Pre- 2008 Net Income/Loss ($62,000,000 * 20%), 85655=There will be a Deemed Termination as of December 31, 2008 if the Taxpayer is not permitted to unwind the transaction.Ã‚Â  Substantiated transaction costs in an Actual Termination will be added to basis if they are incurred before January 1, 2011.Ã‚Â , 70245=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Plus 80% OID Ã¢Â€Â“ Pre-2006 Years ($18,000,000 * 80%), 55080=b.Ã‚Â Does Ã¢Â€Âœactual termination on/before December 31, 2008Ã¢Â€? mean Ã¢Â€Âœactual termination on/before September 30, 2009Ã¢Â€??, 44737=Ã‚Â If there is no Actual Termination by December 31, 2010, and ""Actual Termination Gain"" is less than ""Deemed Termination Gain"", will the difference be recovered?, 65919=2010 Ordinary Loss on Actual Termination, 94489=The 2008 OID would be included in the Deemed Termination proceeds.Ã‚Â  There will be no basis offset for the 2008 OID, thus the 2008 OID will be recognized as part of the gain.Ã‚Â  In an Actual Termination in 2008, the 2008 OID will be disregarded., 87997=Assume that the Taxpayer from Example 4.20 received free cash in 2005 of $1,700,000.Ã‚Â  Following is the Deemed Termination Gain/(Loss) calculation:, 80023=Ã‚Â If the Taxpayer from Example 4.20 has tax losses in barred tax years of $(39,000,000), and there was no Actual Termination, the Taxpayer would have a Deemed Termination on December 31, 2008.Ã‚Â  Thus, the cumulative losses claimed in the tax years that are currently open for examination equal $(62,000,000) (i.e., $101,000,000 Ã¢Â€Â“ 39,000,000 = $62,000,000).Ã‚Â  The Deemed Termination calculation would include the recapture of the tax benefits from barred years, because no tax adjustments were made to disallow the transaction for those years.Ã‚Â  The TaxpayerÃ¢Â€Â™s Deemed Termination gain is calculated as follows:, 19898=How can a taxpayer determine which transactions will be treated as SILO transactions that must be included in any settlement? Attachment 2 to the SILO letter states that the taxpayer must provide a list of all transactions Ã¢Â€Âœthat are the same as or substantially similar to those described in Notice 2005-13 for which losses or deductions were claimed in any taxable year.Ã¢Â€? It is not clear which transactions will be considered substantially similar to the SILO transactions described in Notice 2005-13. Notice 2005-13 identifies as a SILO a transaction that includes (1) a tax indifferent entity (e.g., foreign corporation or governmental body), (2) economic defeasance of rent and purchase option price, and (3) limited risk of loss or profit due to change in value of leased property. Does the inclusion or absence of any one particular item above affect whether a transaction is considered a SILO? For example, would a transaction with a U.S. corporate lessee that is liable for U.S. income tax at the time of the transaction be treated as a SILO? Would a transaction that does not have economic defeasance (or includes only partial economic defeasance) be treated as a SILO? If a taxpayer excludes a transaction from a settlement agreement because of a reasonable belief that the transaction is not a SILO, what would be the consequences if the Service contends that the transaction should be treated as a SILO?}",,

If that was the case, then what was the point of Urd and Peorth goading them on, or when yggdrasil went down, shouldn\'t that have taken out the spell temporarily? I just think that the author forgot what he was going for, and just wrote random explanation, I mean 25 years is a long time and ideas tend to be forgotten. I could easily relate to the character when he was too shy to do anything sexual to her since that\'s how I am in real life(shy). I mean I love innocent romance, and I love the series for it. I can\'t really see them making out every chapter. If anyone wants that, there are other manga.

The funds to support these activities will come directly from the consumers through fees. Although many people feel that this is a service that should be provided to them for free, it should be understood that banks are for-profit businesses with the ultimate goal of making money. In addition, there are costs associated with running a business. Even the almighty too-big-to-fail banks are not immune to these costs. Why do banks consistently charge these fees despite knowing how despise they are by their banking customers? Ã‚Â Reasons for a monthly checking account fee Flickr source Free checking accounts have been non-existent at major U.S. banks for quite some time now, but you can still get your checking accounts for free. Many banks are willing to waive the cost of these pesky monthly fees when certain requirements are met Ã¢Â€Â” typically by maintaining a minimum balance or by posting direct deposits every month. Here is the basic checking account fee comparison at the 10 biggest banks in the U.S. Twitter Facebook","A basic checking account is defined as a non-interest checking account with the lowest monthly fee offered, which can be avoided with a minimum balance or direct deposit. Though the same fee at any given bank tends to be consistent across the country, certain fees may vary depending on where you live. We advise that you check with your local branch for the most accurate fee and waiver policy. Basic checking account fee comparison According to the August banking analysis by MyBankTracker.com, the average basic checking account fee at the top 10 U.S. banks is at $9.99. Currently, the most expensive monthly maintenance fee is $15 at TD Bank, while lowest fee of $7 per month can be found at both PNC and SunTrust Bank. Note that some banks will give you a discount on your monthly fee if you decide to opt out of paper statements and switch to online statements. For example, U.S. Bank will give you a $2 discount, at which time the fee will be lowered to $6.95 per month Ã¢Â€Â” making it the lowest monthly maintenance fee at the top 10 banks. TD Bank will give you a $1 discount for this change, bringing the fee down to $14 a month Ã¢Â€Â” which still makes it the highest fee at the 10 major banks. Wells Fargo also offers a $2 discount with online-only statements.

If S Ã‚Â is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be lost (underfit); if S Ã‚Â is too small, the spline will pick up too much noise (overfit). In the extreme cases the routine will return an interpolating spline ÃŽÂ¸ = 0 Ã‚Â if S Ã‚Â is set to zero, and the weighted least-squares cubic polynomial ÃŽÂ· = 0 Ã‚Â if S Ã‚Â is set very large.

When there is a teacher is involved, the process is called supervised learning. Otherwise, it is called unsupervised learning. In both cases, there are different types of feedback that the network can use to modify the connections. The following table illustrates the various learning situations our robot might encounter. In each cell of the table, we have briefly described a situation that illustrates the relevant learning mode. Here is a picture of our robot showing the two light sensors mounted on the front. Note that the sonar sensors also visible in this picture are not used in this experiment. In the previous article, we developed a light following robot controlled by an artificial neural network where we manually set the connection weights between inputs and outputs. Since the number of connections was small and the behavior was simple, it was fairly easy to guess a set of weights that would work. However, this will rarely be the case with bigger networks and more complex behaviors. In those situations, we will need a way for the robot to learn the connection strengths between input and","With supervised exemplar learning, the correct pattern of activity across the output units is known and can be compared to the current output pattern. In reinforcement learning, both supervised and unsupervised, we only know if our current output pattern is correct or incorrect without knowing any more details. And with guided learning, the output units are essentially ""remote controlled"" through the correct sequence of values for a given set of input values. Statistical learning does not involve outputs per se, but simply a collection of input patterns whose general trend or summary properties we want to determine. Observational learning involves watching another individualÃ¢Â€Â”usually of the same speciesÃ¢Â€Â”perform some action, then extracting the information required from those observations for performing the action yourself. We will have occasion to examine all these learning modes in greater depth in future articles, but for our light following robot, we are going to begin with the easiest learning mode highlighted in gray which is supervised exemplar learning. It's All About The Connections In all cases of learning, we need a method for changing the connection weights over time so that performance improves. The particular method of modifying the weights is called the update rule for that network. In general, we are looking for a process that will strengthen the connection between units that are active at the same time while weakening the connection when they are activated out of sync or in opposite directions;",True,0,0,"{14278=Fortunately, this problem has been worked on since the 1940s and now has many different solutions depending on your goals and the complexity of the network involved. Many of the solutions are extensions of an early update rule called Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning was first formulated in 1949 by Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb and is often summarized by the phrase ""cells that fire together, wire together"". The idea is that if our current output unit values perform the correct motor response for the current input unit values, then we should strengthen the connections such that this mapping is more likely to occur in the future. This can be achieved by using the following update rule:, 30598=To simulate the delta rule learning algorithm for our light following robot, we start by picking two random numbers between T and 1024 to represent the readings on the two light sensors where T is the minimum light value we want our robot to respond to. After normalizing the resulting vector, we multiply the values by the normalized ""right brain"" connection matrix to obtain the output values that the network would currently send to the motors. Then we multiply the same normalized input values by the ""left brain"" connection matrix to see what the target output values should be. These are the target values. Finally, we use the delta rule to update the right brain connection strengths and re-normalize the matrix. This process is then repeated for as many learning trials as we like., 28570=The third method uses a threshold function to convert the original data into discrete values, typically 0 and 1. For example, when using a sonar sensor to measure distance, one might set the threshold to three feet (36 inches) and assign a value of 1 to any reading below this number and a 0 to any reading above it. In this way, the sensor's original data is converted into a kind of alert wherein objects closer than three feet generate a warning whereas objects further away do not. It might seem that thresholding the inputs would result in noticeably ""discrete"" behavior from the robot and it would if we only had one input. But imagine the more realistic situation where we have ten sensors. Then the thresholded data is the equivalent of a 10-digit binary number that can take on 210 or 1024 values. Having over a thousand possible graded responses would generally be sufficient for almost any situation.}",,

The film's message that family, friendship, and virtue are the true definitions of wealth has resonated through the ages and made it an American classic. However, at the time of its release, the FBI's Director, J. Edgar Hoover, investigated the film, its writers and director because of criticism the movie was too tough on bankers and might turn Americans against the capitalist system. (This institutional penchant for witchhunts of dissenters is yet another reason why we need strong controls on the FBI.

According to Huffington Post, just the top three bailout banks have spent $71 million in lobbying money to weaken these bills. The banks may have the big bucks, but the people have the big numbers! Now is a critical time for citizens to weigh in to strengthen these bills., 4710=The Center for Media and Democracy's BanksterUSA campaign released a new video today, ""It's NOT Such a Wonderful Life,"" saluting the classic film by Frank Capra.

Shutter windows and secure outside doors. If shutters are not available, close window blinds, shades or curtains. Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal. Get inside a home, building, or hard top automobile (not a convertible). Although you may be injured if lightning strikes your car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than outside. Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage. Postpone outdoor activities. Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm.

Some of the most severe occur when a single thunderstorm affects one location for an extended time. Thunderstorms typically produce heavy rain for a brief period, anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Warm, humid conditions are highly favorable for thunderstorm development. About 10 percent of thunderstorms are classified as severe Ã¢Â€Â“ one that produces hail at least an inch or largerÃ‚Â in diameter, has winds of 58 miles per hour or higher or produces a tornado. Facts about Lightning LightningÃ¢Â€Â™s unpredictability increases the risk to individuals and property. Lightning often strikes outside of heavy rain and may occur as far as 10 miles away from any rainfall. Ã¢Â€ÂœHeat lightningÃ¢Â€? is actually lightning from a thunderstorm too far away from thunder to be heard. However, the storm may be moving in your direction. Most lightning deaths and injuries occur when people are caught outdoors in the summer months during the afternoon and evening. Your chances of being struck by lightning are estimated to be 1 in 600,000 but could be reduced even further by following safety precautions. Lightning strike victims carry no electrical charge and should be attended to immediately.

Ã‚Â  MarchÃ‚Â 18,Ã‚Â 2014, 14024=NHL Barometer: Career Year for Duchene Ã‚Â  MarchÃ‚Â 15,Ã‚Â 2014, 52004=1/28/2015, 58446=11/22/2014, 59853=10/12/2014, 60562=4/4/2014, 56027=1/13/2015, 64216=Ruutu was the source of distraction when it appeared that he would enter salary arbitration in the offseason. Setting career highs as Ruutu did last year is obviously a fine way to bid for a lucrative contract. However, despite racking up a career-best 54 points (26G, 28A) in 79 games, 'Canes brass exercised caution by putting thought into the fact that Ruutu is familiar with the injury bug. You see, Ruutu is a pesky character in his own right when it comes to hits -- he amassed 228 of them last year -- but when over-aggression leads to injuries, there is cause for concern. A bad ankle injury deemed him helpless against the Penguins in the conference finals, but nonetheless, the 'Canes eventually secured Ruutu's services with a three year, $11.4 million contract in July 2009. Now that he's healthy and satisfied with the new deal, look for plenty of production out of No. 15. GM Jim Rutherford said to the Raleigh News & Observer in the offseason that he expects 25-35 goals out of the emerging, physical Ruutu. His best years are still ahead of him., 66222=Ruutu finally re-signed with the Hawks a day before the start of training camp. In the offseason it was a game of posturing as he was even talking in his home country of Finland about retiring. Ruutu was plagued with injuries in 2005-06 and his one-time bright star is dulling rapidly. He missed the first month of the 2006-07 season after spraining his left knee., 66689=Most observers are expecting a breakout season for Ruutu after a solid second half in 2003-04. He led the team in goals with 23 and tied Kyle Calder for the team lead in power play goals with 10. He also led the team in game-winning goals with three, while being among the top five in goals, assists (21), points (44), power play goals (10) and power play points (17)., 56834=1/12/2015, 65677=If there is one player on the Hawks' 2007-08 roster that has received some acclaim the last few years on the Hawks roster, it has to be Ruutu. Ruutu, who has struggled with injuries, was healthy last season playing in 71 games, but he only tallied 17 goals and 21 assists. The shine on this prospect appears to be fading before it even lit up, and he may lose out on some playing time with the influx of younger, capable talent on the roster., 66634=2005-06, 59124=10/21/2014, 63241=Ruutu recovered nicely from his injury-shortened 2009-10 campaign, tallying a career-high 57 points last season without missing a single game. The 6-foot sparkplug really found his stride last year with the Hurricanes, and no signs point to the contrary moving forward., 61493=2014-15, 63186=2011-12, 67106=2004-05, 8634=Age is determined on October 1st of each season., 61727=Ruutu played most of last season with a hip injury, but still managed to record nine points in the 17 games he played. He underwent successful surgery for the ailment shortly after the end of the regular season, and it's expected he'll be ready to go come training camp. Assuming he's healthy, Ruutu should open the season as the Hurricanes' second-line right winger alongside Jordan Staal and Jeff Skinner, a combination that has good point-producing potential. Ruutu will likely have fallen off the average poolie's fantasy radar come October, so don't be afraid to take a flyer on him in the later rounds of your draft - he has good sleeper pick potential., 64161=2009-10, 10479=During an average game, Tuomo Ruutu was on the ice for 10:52., 65329=2008-09, 62434=2012-13, 10412=Average Time On Ice in 2014-15, 13158=Published FebruaryÃ‚Â 21,Ã‚Â 2015, 10823=During an average game, Tuomo Ruutu was on the ice for 0:07 during power plays., 10745=Average Power Play Time On Ice in 2014-15, 55150=1/14/2015, 63559=2010-11, 62489=Though Ruutu's fantasy owners may have been disappointed by the 29 year-old's production in 2011-2012 relative to what he was able to accomplish the year previous, it is important to keep an eye on his shots on goal; tallying 156 last year, the Finnish veteran got to the net more often than he did during that more impressive 2010-2011 campaign. His production dropped 23 points from 57 to 34 and his hits total fell nearly by 150. Though Ruutu's ice-time will almost assuredly take a hit with Jordan Staal coming to town, he still makes for a decent sleeper pick in the later rounds, especially pools that reward secondary statistics such as hits.}",,"{1988=Agreed to a four-year deal worth $4.75 million per year in February 2012., 3326=2014-15 Fantasy Hockey Outlook, 4817=2014-15 NHL Stats, 1739=MarchÃ‚Â 7,Ã‚Â 2015 Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“Ã‚Â  Tuomo Ruutu News, 3533=See Our 2014-15 Projections, 4110=2014-15 NHL Projections}"

DonÃ¢Â€Â™t be surprised if you see more clean sheets as the defensive unit continues to gel during this period of (relatively) good health. Fortunately for San Jose, they seem to have found some consistency.

Video Audio,"In depth Verdict Those to have seen a racecourse are entitled to improve, with Irish raider SPLIT THE ATOM making most appeal after finishing behind the highly-touted War Envoy on debut at Naas when running exceptionally green. He should be far straighter now and is a hopeful choice. There are some potentially interesting newcomers on show with Subversive worthy of respect as a son of Invincible Spirit and bred by the powerful Darley operation. Sandgate and Dragon King are other first-timers to note, hailing from the yards of Fahey and Dods respectively, both of whom have been in good form with two-year-olds so far this season. Obviously the market should help to sort out the aforementioned trio as they all represent teams with plenty of ammunition in this division and thus enjoy a good line to juvenile form.

Some people swear by double-layer socks; some say they have an awkward fit. As a general rule, double layer socks will help prevent blistering by reducing the amount of friction underfoot, but only if they fit comfortably. The arch, toe area and heel should fit close to the skin but not so snugly that they stretch, and not so loosely that they hang over any part of the foot. Return To Top Sizing and Fit High-quality padded socks offer high-density weaves in certain areas for an anatomical fit and better cushioning. A dense weave sock will offer better cushioning to compensate for physical deficiencies. As we get older the fatty pads on the bottom of our feet deteriorate resulting in a reduction in overall cushioning. Padded Today, many manufacturers use merino wool, a fine grade wool that offers a softer, non-itchy feel against the skin. Aside from managing moisture and insulating the foot, wool also holds its shape better than other materials. The original natural fiber, wool offers great wicking action while retaining its cushioning properties.

The particular taste of each water reflects its origin and terroir. Geological strata allow water to absorb minerals; each areaÃ¢Â€Â™s mix of minerals contributes to the unique characteristics of a single source water (water drawn from one location). The minerals also contribute to daily dietary needs. Distilled water is tasteless and makes no significant contribution to your a dietÃ¢Â€Â™s daily mineral needs. Aquafina and Dasani are examples of distilled waters to which minerals are added. Texture & Mouthfeel Texture is the surface quality; mouthfeel is, literally, how food or drink feels in oneÃ¢Â€Â™s mouth. While some use the terms interchangeably, both are sensory evaluations of tactile impressions on the palate. For texture, think of the crispiness of a potato chip, the crunchiness of a pickle, cookies and crackers; the resiliency of a gum drop or marshmallow. For mouthfeel, think of the unctuousness of olive oil, the creaminess of puddings. These are just a few examples of characteristics that make food appealing and satisfying to consumers.","What does this mean? When tasting water, the most important factor in its overall sensationÃ¢Â€Â”what we call flavorÃ¢Â€Â”is the mouthfeel generated by the size, amount and distribution of the bubbles, or the absence of them. Water 101 is just the beginning of understanding how to evaluate and appreciate fine bottled waters. In other articles we will continue to explore connoisseurship and the components of water.

Confirmed Lender Annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate. The APR includes the interest rate, points, lender fees, and certain other financing charges the borrower is required to pay. Using APR to compare quotes is helpful because it takes into account both the interest rate and financing fees. The APR is calculated by Zillow.

Adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medications is necessary to achieve HIV suppression and non-adherence can lead to treatment resistant genetic variants of HIV. People living with HIV/AIDS often experience difficulty sustaining high-levels of treatment adherence. Most factors that interfere with adherence are unanticipated and occur between clinical visits, including depression, side effects, substance use, and lapses in pharmacy refill. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test a cell phone-delivered theory-based medication adherence counseling intervention. The intervention is grounded in Self-Regulation Model and utilizes unannounced pill counts to monitor adherence and guide corrective feedback within the counseling context. Using pill count adherence information for counseling allows providers to detect and correct patient non-adherence within a time frame that can head off viral resistance. An experimental factorial design will test the effects of counseling and a text message reminder system as well the interaction of counseling and text message components with 600 men and women receiving HIV treatment. Following screening, informed consent and baseline assessments participants will be randomized to one of four intervention conditions:(a) self-regulation counseling + regimen tailored text message reminders; (b) self-regulation counseling only; (c) control counseling + regimen tailored text reminders; or (d) control counseling only.

Dies gilt als InitialzÃƒÂ¼ndung fÃƒÂ¼r die GrÃƒÂ¼ndung des Labels Metal Blade., 2160=Die Anregungen fÃƒÂ¼r mÃƒÂ¶gliche Bands holte sich Slagel fÃƒÂ¼r die ersten Ausgaben durch Tape-Trading und den Besuch von Konzerten. Lars Ulrich und James Hetfield von Metallica schickten Slagel ein Demoband von Hit the Lights, auf dem Lloyd Grant, ein junger, jamaikanischer Gitarrenspieler, der sich auf ein Zeitungsinserat gemeldet hatte, noch die Gitarrensoli spielte, obwohl Mustaine bereits in der Band war. Als BegrÃƒÂ¼ndung diente, dass Hetfield und Ulrich Grants Soli einfach besser fanden. 1983 sah er Slayer als Vorband von Bitch und war so ÃƒÂ¼berwÃƒÂ¤ltigt, dass er sie als erste Band auf die dritte Ausgabe des Samplers holte. Zu den Bands, deren Erfolg auf einem Beitrag zum Sampler beruht, gehÃƒÂ¶ren auch Armored Saint, Voivod oder Fates Warning., 4446=Brian Slagel, GrÃƒÂ¼nder von Metal Blade Records, arbeitete 1981 in einem Plattenladen in Los Angeles. Auf seine Bitte hin erhielt er die Erlaubnis vom Inhaber, neben den aus den USA stammenden Alben auch Importe wie die VerÃƒÂ¶ffentlichungen von Iron Maiden anbieten zu dÃƒÂ¼rfen. Dieses Zusatzangebot stieÃƒÂŸ auf reges Interesse der KÃƒÂ¤ufer, die Slagel auf die aktive Metal-Szene in Los Angeles mit Bands wie Ratt, Malice oder Steeler aufmerksam machten. So grÃƒÂ¼ndete er wenig spÃƒÂ¤ter ein Fanzine mit dem Namen The New Heavy Metal Revue und entwickelte die Idee, diese Szene mit einem Sampler unter dem Titel Metal Massacre vorzustellen., 842=Seitdem wurden unter der Bezeichnung Metal Massacre insgesamt 13 Sampler verÃƒÂ¶ffentlicht, der letzte im Jahr 2006.}"

Biography Formed: 1970 Genre: Electronic Years Active: '60s, '70s It's not exactly fair to peg the Undisputed Truth as a one-hit wonder, because they did have a few hits for Motown in the first half of the 1970s (albeit only one big one), as well as made half a dozen albums for the label. Still, it's not that far from the truth. Nothing else they did matched the strength of ""Smiling Faces Sometimes,"" which made number three in 1971. Crafted by Norman Whitfield, Motown's most adventurous producer of the time, it employed...

This was Lucerito's debut for Melody, after spending 4 years as a child singer managed by Sergio Andrade and recording for Discos Musart. This was her first real declaration of young womanhood and is full of 80's classics like ""Millones Mejor Que TÃƒÂº"" and her Tifanny-esque ""Vete Con Ella (chapel of love)"". This whole record is fantastic, even her 2 ballads ""Amiga Fiel"" and ""No Me Hablen De El"". Nice example of late 80's pop Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  by ojosdemiel There's a lot of terrific songs on this album with that great late 80's vibe to it. This album also really helped Lucero become a major music star that would carry her into the 90's and beyond.

In response, Dave Studeman brought up Mariano RiveraÃ¢Â€Â“another pitcher with consistently low BABIPsÃ¢Â€Â“and how it has been somewhat proven that elite relievers can register atypical results with this statistic. Mentioned on a few other sites was the idea that movement may be a central cause for these lower batting averages on balls in play; due to said movement, the sweet part of the bat would fail to meet the ball as it normally would on more Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€? pitches. Last week, we explored the relationship between fastballs 92+ mph and BABIP, examining how it differed at each mile per hour interval. 92 mph to 96 mph clocked in between .290-.310Ã¢Â€Â“the established general range of BABIP for pitchersÃ¢Â€Â“before dipping to .273 at 97 mph and shooting back up to .293 for all thrown 98 mph or higher. The 97 and 98+ groups were too small in their sample sizes to definitively fail the 5% hypothesis; we would need around 1,650 balls in play and, combined, had 1,032. Still, the combo of 97 and 98+ offered a .279 BABIP, perhaps suggesting that the .293 at 98+ was the anomaly, not the .273. Today we will look at the movement within the same 92+ mph range in order to attempt to answer the question posed in the title. First, though, a pre-requisite of sorts with regards to movement:","BABIP takes a while to stabilize, moreso than many other statistics, so I wanted to have at least 2,000 balls in play for each sub-grouping, preferably more. From 0-12 inches of horizontal movement we have large enough samples to notice discrepancies. Greater than 12 inches, however, offers just 743 balls in play. While I definitely plan to explore this and the velocity articles later in the year when more data is available, for now, I am going to exclude the group with more than 12 horizontal inches. Looking at the other three groups and their two subgroupings each, here are the Ball%, Strike%, HR%, and BABIP: Horiz. Vert. B% K% HR% BABIP 0-4 Below 35.9 45.6 0.53 .289 0-4 Above 34.9 49.8 0.48 .286 4-8 Below 35.8 43.7 0.64 .302 4-8 Above 35.8 48.2 0.58 .292",True,0,0,"{24209=June 26, 2008 11 Comments, 15339=Before even getting into the meat of this article, no, the title does not refer to Bip RobertsÃ¢Â€Â¦ so IÃ¢Â€Â™ll understand if hardcore fans of his are now turned off.Ã¯Â¿Â½ What the title does refer to, however, is balls in play and how they pertain to the statistics BABIP, FIP, and ERA.Ã¯Â¿Â½ I have written a lot here and on my other stomping grounds of late about how some of these statistics are affected and, seeing as it is a holiday weekend with not much interweb usage, it seemed like the logical time to recap everything into one neat package.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For starters, what are these three statistics? BABIP: Batting Average on Balls In Play is a statistical spawn of the DIPS theory discovered by Voros McCracken at the turn of the century.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Essentially Voros found that pitchers have next to no control over balls put in play against them, which is why certain pitchers would surrender a ton of hits one year and much less the next.Ã¯Â¿Â½ From a control standpoint, the goal of the pitcher would be to get an out.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Once a ball is put in play, unless it is hit right back to the pitcher many defensive aspects have to coincide for an out to result.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Take a groundball for instance, one between shortstop and third base: both fielders have to understand whose territory the ball occupies and that fielder has to have the proper range in order to field it, all in a very short amount of time.Ã¯Â¿Â½ There are plenty of other variables as well but what should be clear is that the pitcher has no control over them.Ã¯Â¿Â½ He may have control over sustaining a certain percentage of balls in play each year but the hits that result are almost entirely out of his hand.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In fact, the only aspects of pitching over which he has any type of control are walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Everything else is dependant on the fielding and luck. BABIP is calculated by dividing the Hits minus Home Runs by the Plate Appearances excluding Home Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, and Sacrifice Flies.Ã¯Â¿Â½ If Player A has 30 hits out of 90 at-bats he will post a .333 batting average.Ã¯Â¿Â½ But ifÃ¯Â¿Â½8 of those 30 hits are home runs and 8 of the outs are strikeouts, in BABIP terms he would be 22 for 74, or .297.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This explains that, of all balls put in playÃ¢Â€Â“any hit or batted out other than a home runÃ¢Â€Â“29.7% fell in for hits. FIP:Ã¯Â¿Â½a creation of Tom TangoÃ¢Â€Â™s, Fielding Independent Pitching takes the three controllable skills of walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed, properly weights them, and then scales the result similar to the familiar ERA.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The end result explains what a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skillset suggests his ERA should be around.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Someone with an ERA much lower than their FIP is usually considered to be lucky while the inverse is also true.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The statistic is kept at Fangraphs and ERA-FIP was recently added as well in order to allow readers a glimpse at those under- or overperforming their controllable skills. ERA: arguably the most popular pitching barometer, ERA can be calculated by multiplying the earned runs of a pitcher by nine and dividing that product by the total number of innings pitched.Ã¯Â¿Â½ While not a terrible stat it suffers from some pretty drastic noise.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For starters, what are earned runs?Ã¯Â¿Â½ The surname Ã¢Â€Â˜earnedÃ¢Â€Â™ implies there are other runs that can be given up and that these must satisfy a specific criteria.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, if a fielder botches a routine play with two outs, and the pitcher then gives up seven runs, none will be earned because the inning was extended by the poor play of the fielder.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This gets into all sorts of questions regarding exactly what an error is and how that factors into a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s performance. Earned runs are also a direct result of hits, which have been proven to be largely accrued through chance via the DIPS theory.Ã¯Â¿Â½ So, if pitchers cannot control the percentage of hits they give up on balls in play, then fluctuations in hits can either inflate or deflate an ERA regardless of the pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skill level.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Therefore the FIP is more indicative of performance level because it only measures the three aspects of pitching he has control over which should not suffer from much fluctuation at all, as Pizza Cutter showed not too long ago that these skills were some of the quickest to stabilize. Controlling BABIP At Fangraphs we occasionally call upon a statistic we titled xBABIP, which refers to what the BABIP of a pitcher can be expected to be given his percentage of line drives.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dave Studeman found a few years back that the general range ofÃ¯Â¿Â½BABIP could be predicted with very good accuracy by adding .12 to the LD%; if a pitcher surrendered 22.1% line drives his xBABIP would be ~.341.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Using this for predictive purposes would not be correct due to the fact that the general baseline for pitchers is .300.Ã¯Â¿Â½ What we can do is evaluate performance atÃ¯Â¿Â½a given time and attribute line drives to a rather high or low BABIP.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, saying that Player BÃ¢Â€Â™s BABIP of .275 as of today primarily due to his ultra-low 14-15% LD rate would be correct; saying that it will continue like this would not.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The line drive percentage may change as the season goes on.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In summation, we can use something like this when evaluating the past for pitchers but not the future. David Appelman showed not too long ago that, in 2007, 15% of flyballs fell in for hits, 24% of grounders turned into hits, and a whopping 73% of line drives also followed suit.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Due to this, the ideal xBABIP calculation would be .15(FB) + .24(GB) + .73(LD). I have done studies here recently, and Jonathan Hale at Baseball Digest Daily has done others in the past as well, that show how aspects like velocity, movement, and location can all affect the BABIP of a given pitcher.Ã¯Â¿Â½ It also been shown, again by Studeman, that elite relievers have the ability to consistently post lower BABIPs than others.Ã¯Â¿Â½ More studies have shown that pitchers, if any, have very weak control over their BABIP but instead of deeming it control I would be more inclined to say that these pitchers are merely taking advantage of Ã¢Â€Âœcold spots.Ã¢Â€?Ã¯Â¿Â½ If just 15% of flyballs result in hits and such a large number of line drives do, then we could intuitively expect someone with consistently low LD rates and higher FB rates to post lower BABIPs.Ã¯Â¿Â½ From a movement perspective, I found that those with above average vertical movement in different horizontal movement subgroupings post lower BABIPs as well.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Higher vertical movement usually correlates to flyballs, and voila, flyballs have the lowest percentage of hits. This was just a recap of the three statistics and explanations pertaining to their usage.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Based on this, if we see someone like Carlos Zambrano, whose ERA consistently beats his FIP, based on consistently posting lower BABIPs, we could somewhat safely assume that he might not be controlling anything persay but rather taking advantage of all the aspects proven to result in lower BABIPs.Ã¯Â¿Â½ His controllable skills may not be as good as his ERA would suggest but movement, velocity, and location may have combined to greatly aid his efforts., 3128=July 21, 2009 3 Comments, 15136=July 5, 2008 3 Comments, 39852=June 19, 2008 32 Comments, 33784=June 20, 2008 Leave a comment, 40064=Back on December 20th, John Walsh wrote a very interesting article at The Hardball Times, taking everything recorded by the Pitch F/X system in 2007 and, amongst others, calculating the average velocity, horizontal movement, and vertical movement for the four major pitches: fastball, curveball, slider, and changeup.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The results showed that the average fastball clocked in at 91 mph with -6.2 inches of horizontal movement and 8.9 inches of vertical movement.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The author acknowledged that he did not differentiate between four-seamers, two-seamers, and cutters, but rather lumped them all together in determining the averages; two-seamers and cutters differ in velocity and movement components from four-seamers., 5207=June 10, 2009 4 Comments, 11963=August 15, 2008 13 Comments}",,

In response, Dave Studeman brought up Mariano RiveraÃ¢Â€Â“another pitcher with consistently low BABIPsÃ¢Â€Â“and how it has been somewhat proven that elite relievers can register atypical results with this statistic. Mentioned on a few other sites was the idea that movement may be a central cause for these lower batting averages on balls in play; due to said movement, the sweet part of the bat would fail to meet the ball as it normally would on more Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€? pitches. Last week, we explored the relationship between fastballs 92+ mph and BABIP, examining how it differed at each mile per hour interval. 92 mph to 96 mph clocked in between .290-.310Ã¢Â€Â“the established general range of BABIP for pitchersÃ¢Â€Â“before dipping to .273 at 97 mph and shooting back up to .293 for all thrown 98 mph or higher. The 97 and 98+ groups were too small in their sample sizes to definitively fail the 5% hypothesis; we would need around 1,650 balls in play and, combined, had 1,032. Still, the combo of 97 and 98+ offered a .279 BABIP, perhaps suggesting that the .293 at 98+ was the anomaly, not the .273. Today we will look at the movement within the same 92+ mph range in order to attempt to answer the question posed in the title. First, though, a pre-requisite of sorts with regards to movement:","Below 35.8 43.7 0.64 .302 4-8 Above 35.8 48.2 0.58 .292 8-12 Below 35.6 41.4 0.54 .315 8-12 Above 36.5 45.6 0.58 .298 The percentage of balls essentially stays in the same general range while the strikes fluctuate. The subgroupings with above average vertical movement have much higher strike percentages than others. So, judging by this it seems before we even get to BABIP, that higher vertical movement in these larger groups result in a higher percentage of strikes. The BABIPs for horizontal movement groups with below average vertical movement register: .289, .302, and .315. The BABIPs for horizontal movement with above average vertical movement clock in at: .286, .292, .298. Judging from these results it would appear that, yes, movement does have some type of effect on BABIP. Each horizontal group posted higher counts when they had below average vertical movement, and at every interval as well; .289 to .286, .302 to .292, and .315 to .298. Additionally, all pitches 92+ mph with 0-4 inches of horizontal movement, regardless",False,-1,0,"{24209=June 26, 2008 11 Comments, 15339=Before even getting into the meat of this article, no, the title does not refer to Bip RobertsÃ¢Â€Â¦ so IÃ¢Â€Â™ll understand if hardcore fans of his are now turned off.Ã¯Â¿Â½ What the title does refer to, however, is balls in play and how they pertain to the statistics BABIP, FIP, and ERA.Ã¯Â¿Â½ I have written a lot here and on my other stomping grounds of late about how some of these statistics are affected and, seeing as it is a holiday weekend with not much interweb usage, it seemed like the logical time to recap everything into one neat package.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For starters, what are these three statistics? BABIP: Batting Average on Balls In Play is a statistical spawn of the DIPS theory discovered by Voros McCracken at the turn of the century.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Essentially Voros found that pitchers have next to no control over balls put in play against them, which is why certain pitchers would surrender a ton of hits one year and much less the next.Ã¯Â¿Â½ From a control standpoint, the goal of the pitcher would be to get an out.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Once a ball is put in play, unless it is hit right back to the pitcher many defensive aspects have to coincide for an out to result.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Take a groundball for instance, one between shortstop and third base: both fielders have to understand whose territory the ball occupies and that fielder has to have the proper range in order to field it, all in a very short amount of time.Ã¯Â¿Â½ There are plenty of other variables as well but what should be clear is that the pitcher has no control over them.Ã¯Â¿Â½ He may have control over sustaining a certain percentage of balls in play each year but the hits that result are almost entirely out of his hand.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In fact, the only aspects of pitching over which he has any type of control are walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Everything else is dependant on the fielding and luck. BABIP is calculated by dividing the Hits minus Home Runs by the Plate Appearances excluding Home Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, and Sacrifice Flies.Ã¯Â¿Â½ If Player A has 30 hits out of 90 at-bats he will post a .333 batting average.Ã¯Â¿Â½ But ifÃ¯Â¿Â½8 of those 30 hits are home runs and 8 of the outs are strikeouts, in BABIP terms he would be 22 for 74, or .297.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This explains that, of all balls put in playÃ¢Â€Â“any hit or batted out other than a home runÃ¢Â€Â“29.7% fell in for hits. FIP:Ã¯Â¿Â½a creation of Tom TangoÃ¢Â€Â™s, Fielding Independent Pitching takes the three controllable skills of walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed, properly weights them, and then scales the result similar to the familiar ERA.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The end result explains what a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skillset suggests his ERA should be around.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Someone with an ERA much lower than their FIP is usually considered to be lucky while the inverse is also true.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The statistic is kept at Fangraphs and ERA-FIP was recently added as well in order to allow readers a glimpse at those under- or overperforming their controllable skills. ERA: arguably the most popular pitching barometer, ERA can be calculated by multiplying the earned runs of a pitcher by nine and dividing that product by the total number of innings pitched.Ã¯Â¿Â½ While not a terrible stat it suffers from some pretty drastic noise.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For starters, what are earned runs?Ã¯Â¿Â½ The surname Ã¢Â€Â˜earnedÃ¢Â€Â™ implies there are other runs that can be given up and that these must satisfy a specific criteria.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, if a fielder botches a routine play with two outs, and the pitcher then gives up seven runs, none will be earned because the inning was extended by the poor play of the fielder.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This gets into all sorts of questions regarding exactly what an error is and how that factors into a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s performance. Earned runs are also a direct result of hits, which have been proven to be largely accrued through chance via the DIPS theory.Ã¯Â¿Â½ So, if pitchers cannot control the percentage of hits they give up on balls in play, then fluctuations in hits can either inflate or deflate an ERA regardless of the pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skill level.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Therefore the FIP is more indicative of performance level because it only measures the three aspects of pitching he has control over which should not suffer from much fluctuation at all, as Pizza Cutter showed not too long ago that these skills were some of the quickest to stabilize. Controlling BABIP At Fangraphs we occasionally call upon a statistic we titled xBABIP, which refers to what the BABIP of a pitcher can be expected to be given his percentage of line drives.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dave Studeman found a few years back that the general range ofÃ¯Â¿Â½BABIP could be predicted with very good accuracy by adding .12 to the LD%; if a pitcher surrendered 22.1% line drives his xBABIP would be ~.341.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Using this for predictive purposes would not be correct due to the fact that the general baseline for pitchers is .300.Ã¯Â¿Â½ What we can do is evaluate performance atÃ¯Â¿Â½a given time and attribute line drives to a rather high or low BABIP.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, saying that Player BÃ¢Â€Â™s BABIP of .275 as of today primarily due to his ultra-low 14-15% LD rate would be correct; saying that it will continue like this would not.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The line drive percentage may change as the season goes on.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In summation, we can use something like this when evaluating the past for pitchers but not the future.

BABIP: Batting Average on Balls In Play is a statistical spawn of the DIPS theory discovered by Voros McCracken at the turn of the century.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Essentially Voros found that pitchers have next to no control over balls put in play against them, which is why certain pitchers would surrender a ton of hits one year and much less the next.Ã¯Â¿Â½ From a control standpoint, the goal of the pitcher would be to get an out.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Once a ball is put in play, unless it is hit right back to the pitcher many defensive aspects have to coincide for an out to result.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Take a groundball for instance, one between shortstop and third base: both fielders have to understand whose territory the ball occupies and that fielder has to have the proper range in order to field it, all in a very short amount of time.Ã¯Â¿Â½ There are plenty of other variables as well but what should be clear is that the pitcher has no control over them.Ã¯Â¿Â½ He may have control over sustaining a certain percentage of balls in play each year but the hits that result are almost entirely out of his hand.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In fact, the only aspects of pitching over which he has any type of control are walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Everything else is dependant on the fielding and luck. BABIP is calculated by dividing the Hits minus Home Runs by the Plate Appearances excluding Home Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, and Sacrifice Flies.Ã¯Â¿Â½ If Player A has 30 hits out of 90 at-bats he will post a .333 batting average.Ã¯Â¿Â½ But ifÃ¯Â¿Â½8 of those 30 hits are home runs and 8 of the outs are strikeouts, in BABIP terms he would be 22 for 74, or .297.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This explains that, of all balls put in playÃ¢Â€Â“any hit or batted out other than a home runÃ¢Â€Â“29.7% fell in for hits. FIP:Ã¯Â¿Â½a creation of Tom TangoÃ¢Â€Â™s, Fielding Independent Pitching takes the three controllable skills of walks, strikeouts, and home runs allowed, properly weights them, and then scales the result similar to the familiar ERA.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The end result explains what a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skillset suggests his ERA should be around.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Someone with an ERA much lower than their FIP is usually considered to be lucky while the inverse is also true.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The statistic is kept at Fangraphs and ERA-FIP was recently added as well in order to allow readers a glimpse at those under- or overperforming their controllable skills. ERA: arguably the most popular pitching barometer, ERA can be calculated by multiplying the earned runs of a pitcher by nine and dividing that product by the total number of innings pitched.Ã¯Â¿Â½ While not a terrible stat it suffers from some pretty drastic noise.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For starters, what are earned runs?Ã¯Â¿Â½ The surname Ã¢Â€Â˜earnedÃ¢Â€Â™ implies there are other runs that can be given up and that these must satisfy a specific criteria.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, if a fielder botches a routine play with two outs, and the pitcher then gives up seven runs, none will be earned because the inning was extended by the poor play of the fielder.Ã¯Â¿Â½ This gets into all sorts of questions regarding exactly what an error is and how that factors into a pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s performance. Earned runs are also a direct result of hits, which have been proven to be largely accrued through chance via the DIPS theory.Ã¯Â¿Â½ So, if pitchers cannot control the percentage of hits they give up on balls in play, then fluctuations in hits can either inflate or deflate an ERA regardless of the pitcherÃ¢Â€Â™s skill level.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Therefore the FIP is more indicative of performance level because it only measures the three aspects of pitching he has control over which should not suffer from much fluctuation at all, as Pizza Cutter showed not too long ago that these skills were some of the quickest to stabilize. Controlling BABIP At Fangraphs we occasionally call upon a statistic we titled xBABIP, which refers to what the BABIP of a pitcher can be expected to be given his percentage of line drives.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Dave Studeman found a few years back that the general range ofÃ¯Â¿Â½BABIP could be predicted with very good accuracy by adding .12 to the LD%; if a pitcher surrendered 22.1% line drives his xBABIP would be ~.341.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Using this for predictive purposes would not be correct due to the fact that the general baseline for pitchers is .300.Ã¯Â¿Â½ What we can do is evaluate performance atÃ¯Â¿Â½a given time and attribute line drives to a rather high or low BABIP.Ã¯Â¿Â½ For instance, saying that Player BÃ¢Â€Â™s BABIP of .275 as of today primarily due to his ultra-low 14-15% LD rate would be correct; saying that it will continue like this would not.Ã¯Â¿Â½ The line drive percentage may change as the season goes on.Ã¯Â¿Â½ In summation, we can use something like this when evaluating the past for pitchers but not the future. David Appelman showed not too long ago that, in 2007, 15% of flyballs fell in for hits, 24% of grounders turned into hits, and a whopping 73% of line drives also followed suit.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Due to this, the ideal xBABIP calculation would be .15(FB) + .24(GB) + .73(LD).

Evaluations Keep in mind that ratings done by special interest groups often do not represent a non-partisan stance. In addition, some groups select votes that tend to favor members of one political party over another, rather than choosing votes based solely on issues concerns. Nevertheless, they can be invaluable in showing where an incumbent has stood on a series of votes in the past one or two years, especially when ratings by groups on all sides of an issue are compared. Website links, if available, and descriptions of the organizations offering performance evaluations are accessible by clicking on the name of the group. Most performance evaluations are displayed in a percentage format. However, some organizations present their ratings in the form of a letter grade or endorsement based on voting records, interviews, survey results and/or sources of campaign funding. For consistency and ease in understanding, Project Vote Smart converts all scores into a percentage when possible.

The mould is then unlocked and opened, revealing a perfect duplicate of the original product, complete with a finished coat of primer. Ekena Millwork's urethane millwork line is made up of both standard industry designs as well as their own unique products. Each item begins with a finely crafted original master, which is then used to make several moulds.

XML | CSV | Download as All Senate votes use these words. But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses Ã¢Â€ÂœyeaÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœnayÃ¢Â€? when voting on the final passage of bills. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in Ã¢Â€Âœordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.Ã¢Â€? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.
