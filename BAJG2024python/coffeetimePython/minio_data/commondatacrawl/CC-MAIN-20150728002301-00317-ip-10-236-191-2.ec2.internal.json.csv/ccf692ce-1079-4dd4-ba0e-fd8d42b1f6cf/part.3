The award is calculated as follows: We take the current award month and look at all new CSC registrants 4 months prior. Of those members, we then sum all their CSC contributions for the 3 months leading up to the award month. The member who has added the most content (discussions, replies, documents, videos) earns the Rookie Award. As an example, a new user registers for CSC in the month of January. That user would be eligible for the May Rookie Award. To win, that user would need to create the most combined content of all the new January CSC registrants during the months of February, March, and April. Award Duration: 1 month, 259952=Encode your screencasts as mp4 files, with h264 codec, and aac audio before uploading. For most circumstances we also recommend 15fps as this will keep the bit rate low, the one exception to this is if your video also includes live action video (this is generally not recommended and you should encode at a constant bit rate to mitigate bit rate spikes).

It makes you believe youÃ¢Â€Â™re entering into an evil pact just by smoking this cigar.Ã‚Â  On the band alone I thought I was in for a hell of a strong smoke, but I wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t. I went online to see if someone else felt as I did. I found where smokers had aged the cigar a few months and felt it had definitely dropped a few notches on strength. That may be what happened in my case. When I rolled it in my hand it felt light, which can allow too much air flow resulting in a faster burn and lighter taste. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t get it. I donÃ¢Â€Â™t know why, but my Cult Fuerte was anything but. Fuerte is Spanish for strong or vigorous. My Cult Fuerte wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s touted as a full-bodied cigar with a well-balanced assertive flavor profile. After all, it has an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, Ometepe Nicaraguan binder, and Jalapa, Nicaraguan filler. The one I smoked, and I know that I may have got the exception rather than the rule, was medium at best. I had one concept of the cigar in my mind, and got a whole different taste than I was expecting. Tweet Tweet","Ã‚Â  Check out the review on the Joya De Nicaragua by my son Jared. Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  About Ken York Ken York has written 19 posts in this blog. Ken York is an international cigar writer. He was the unofficial travel correspondent for Cigar Magazine, which is now defunct (not his fault). His friends refer to him as the Dos Equis guy due to his wide range of experiences: Army, Air Force (with a week on an aircraft carrier too), linguist, reporter, actor, author, and he even has a bug named for him: Isoneuromyia yorki Evenhuis, a Vietnames predatory fungus gnat. He prefers medium-bodied cigar with a nice single-malt highlands scotch.

Large values of F are taken as evidence that there is a real treatment effect. (total sum of sqs = error sum of sqs + group sum of sqs) SST = SSE + SSG In the usual abbreviations: The magic (actually the Pythagorean Theorem in an appropriate dimensional space) is that the sums of squares decompose in this way. [math] (4-6.25)^2 +...+(9-6.25)^2 = [(4-5.0)^2+...+(9 - 7.5)^2] + [(5.0 - 6.25)^2+...+(7.5 - 6.25)^2] [/math] Check: 46.25 = 27.5 + 18.75 (5 - 6.25) = (5 - 7.5) + (7.5 - 6.25) ... (9 - 6.25) = (9 - 7.5) + (7.5 - 6.25) (7 - 6.25) = (7 - 7.5) + (7.5 - 6.25) ANOVA begins by expressing the deviation of each observation from the grand mean as a sum of two terms: the difference of the observation from its group mean, plus the difference of the group mean from the grand mean. Writing this out explicitly for the example, we have: (4 - 6.25) = (4 - 5.0) + (5.0 - 6.25) (6 - 6.25) = (6 - 5.0) + (5.0","To compare the amount of skill and luck in these games Sherman would have us carry out an analysis of variance in the same way we did for our example. The players are now seen in the role of treatments. Each player has a mean net gain over the set of games. For each outcome in the table we write the difference between this outcome and the overall mean as the sum of two terms: the difference between the outcome and the player's mean plus the difference between the player's mean and the overall mean. Sherman suggests that the difference between the outcome and the players mean is due primarily to luck while the difference between the players mean and the overall mean is due primarily to skill. This leads him to define the skillÃ‚Â % as the ratio of the of the group sums of squares to the total sums of squares and the luckÃ‚Â % as the ratio of the within group sums of squares to the total sums of squares. We could estimate the luckÃ‚Â % and the skillÃ‚Â % for our poker games by making the same kind of computations we made in our example. However, most statistical packages such as SAS have a program to make these computations for us. Using the SAS ANOVA program, we find that the total sums of squares is 1069.95, the between groups sums of squares is 311.447 and the within groups sums of squares is 758.499.
