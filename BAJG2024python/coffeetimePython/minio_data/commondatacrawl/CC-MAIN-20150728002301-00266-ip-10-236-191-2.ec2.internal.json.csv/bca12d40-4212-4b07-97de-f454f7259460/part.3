I have met several people who have developed into incredible friends. I can rely on them for not only study help, but any other issues we encounter during our first semesters at ISU. In addition to the friends I have met, there is always something to do! Whether it is working out at Le Club, studying in the library, or watching the Sycamores at a sporting event, a student can always stay busy and be actively involved with the campus around them. Am learning a lot Within just my first year at ISU, I gained the skills I need to succeed. My professors, teacher assistants, college advisor and employer have provided my with the knowledge required inside and out of the classroom. The teaching staff was extremely understanding and patient, in addition to always willing to help. Through all the academic assitance, I was able to earn my spot on the college's Dean List with a 3.9 GPA!

Unfortunately being away from home for the first time and the hard class schedule put me behind fairly quickly. As a freshman you are given course classes instead of gen ed classes because they only have a certain amount of space for the classes later on and this is their way of weeding out the students who have chosen the wrong career. After the first semester I can honestly say that I have learned a lot since being here you are responsible for your choices and in the real world you can't rely on your parents or anyone else to help you out.

ISU is definitely the college I needed. Whether a student is enrolled in 12 or 18 credit hours, the cost does not increase. The room board is affordable, in addition to extra costs such as the library, laboratory fees, and the new recreation center. The college is also great at rewarding strong students with scholarships such as the Lap Top Scholarship, awarded to entering Freshman with a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Am enjoying being here I love my time at Indiana State University! I have met several people who have developed into incredible friends. I can rely on them for not only study help, but any other issues we encounter during our first semesters at ISU. In addition to the friends I have met, there is always something to do!

I can rely on them for not only study help, but any other issues we encounter during our first semesters at ISU. In addition to the friends I have met, there is always something to do!

We have a program that students run called Yellow Jacket and this program basically helps students feel safe if its late at night and you want someone to walk you home you give them a call and they will accompany you to your home. This program makes my school feel safer and it is a 24 hour program so at any time you can request an escort.', ""We are a small college and a very academic based college so honesty greek life is mostly community service and to make new friends, don't get the idea of a big party school because Whitman is not one. We are very aware of our goals and future and we do party but we party responsibly. If you are looking for a big Greek Life school Whitman would not be your best choice, however if you want to form part of a greek group that is dedicated, smart and responsibly fun then yes! Whitman is a great college for you."", 'We have over 70 different clubs, these clubs identify with almost all of the students here at whitman, they are a great way to make friends and get involved in something that you are very passionate about.', ""If you have a mind set that college is a place where you will gain useful knowledge for life and for your professional career, and that it won't be easy but you are willing to work for it to accomplish you goals then you are the perfect match for Whitman. It is a fun school and mainly focuses on building amazing students that are hungry to always learn more even after they earn their degree."", 'Although it is pretty expensive, the experience here is unlike most others. Professors truly want you to succeed and will put in a lot of work to see that happen if you want it. Students are very accepting and open and just friendly in general. Faculty puts in countless behind the scene hours to make sure life on campus is enjoyable.', ""Really I can not stress it enough how great this community is. Whitman and Walla Walla keep surprising me with the amount of activities not only on campus but also off campus that it provides. I personally play a varsity sport here at Whitman and I am very involved with the community. I never have days when I have nothing to do but in a good way. I enjoy being busy in daily activities. There are so many great things to do and if there isn't anything special going on like events or parties, there is always something to do with your close fiends like go to town buy ice cream, or watch a movie together. We have a great balance of activities that involve the outdoors and indoors. Its just a wonderful college that does its best to keep its students happy, and I am living proof that it is working!"", 'The food is by far probably the best food I would ever try in a college cafeteria or school campus. We have a great variety of food. You will never get tired of eating on campus. Out dinning halls do a great job to make you high school transition to college easier. Whitman honestly takes care of their students by not only nursing their brains with knowledge but also with good nutritious foods.', 'The dorm life is just great! I will say that in the 5 campus dorms and 1 off campus, the college experience is very different but at the same time they share many things. I say they are different because they are known by the kind of people that they accommodate in them. Everyone is different but in a way Whitman unknowingly incorporates all students in the dining halls and in general the campus is so small that we all get to spend time in each others dorms. The dorms are very nice and the structure of organization is very successful for the students to have a great time and enjoy their college experience.', 'Whitman College is know for its high level of academics, having said that it is nothing is impossible. This school is constantly pushing its students to do better and to grow not only intellectually but also morally and enforces relationships. It is a great libera arts college, and it creates great leaders and provides their students with the key life skills to become a successful person. I highly believe that Whitman should be recognized for its prestige through the leaders and great people that graduate from this institution.', ""Tips for prospective students: I would highly recommend to get involved in a number of school activities, they are a lot of fun and in at the same time they help you make friends and learn more about your community and school Another tip is to time manage and be very organized with school work. If you are organized and make time for everything you wish to accomplish your college experience will be smooth and successful Lastly another tip is to become very involved in your classes with your professors, here at Whitman we have a great opportunity to get close to our professors due to the size of the college so I would highly encourage new students to attend professors' office hours. If you are looking for a small academic college Whitman is what you are looking for!"", 'I would highly recommend Whitman College because of the relations and connections you get to establish. I rate this school from a 10 scale a 9.5 and I take the .5 because it is in a very small town, however it does not take away from how great the school really is. In my opinion it is a great school and near to being perfect.']]",Whitman College Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Whitman-College/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/70968,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,12,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00266-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903230415,903199891,HORIZONTAL,"{67738=There are some wonderful security staff members on campus, as well as many emergency call stations, but everyone is under the impression that security is bored which is why security members have been found to have philosophical conversations with students at 1:00 am., 5439=I'm not going to sugar-coat it, Whitman is very expensive but when it comes down to it, I have loved my first year of college and you cannot put a price on that.

Note that disk usage varies widely given system configuration and specific usage patterns. The recommendations here are general guidelines and provide a starting point for partitioning. The root partition / must always physically contain /etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib and /dev, otherwise you won't be able to boot. Typically 150√¢¬Ä¬ì250MB is needed for the root partition. /usr: contains all user programs (/usr/bin), libraries (/usr/lib), documentation (/usr/share/doc), etc. This is the part of the file system that generally takes up most space. You should provide at least 500MB of disk space. This amount should be increased depending on the number and type of packages you plan to install. A generous workstation or server installation should allow 4√¢¬Ä¬ì6GB. /var: variable data like news articles, e-mails, web sites, databases, the packaging system cache, etc. will be placed under this directory. The size of this directory depends greatly on the usage of your system, but for most people will be dictated by the package management tool's overhead. If you are going to do a full installation of just about everything Debian has to offer, all in one session, setting aside 2 or 3 GB of space for /var should be sufficient.

Using interview data and site visits, the research answers the following questions related to Kenya√¢¬Ä¬ôs slum upgrading initiatives and the importance of financial institutions in housing provision: 1) Why are financial institutions important for slum upgrading?; 2) What are the perceptions of government-led and community-led upgrading projects?; and 3) How does participation in a savings scheme influence preferences for in situ slum upgrading or relocation? Analysis suggests that resident participation in a cooperative savings scheme like the Muungano wa Wanavijiji model positively influences residents perceptions of the abounding opportunities in in situ upgrading as well as voluntary relocation away from their home and familiar surroundings. These speculative conclusions can guide the future of slum upgrading and relocation in Kenya. Grounded in Nairobi√¢¬Ä¬ôs 2010 constitution, the new devolved government system that will provide individual counties with access and control of public money, and the increasing influence of the federation of slum dwellers, Nairobi residents have hope that the slums will soon be history. In the meantime, residents must lobby for government policy change",True,1,0,,
