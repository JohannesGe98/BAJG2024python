Atlanta HIDTA Drug Seizures, by Initiative, in Kilograms, 2008, 2382=Cocaine trafficking and abuse pose the greatest drug threats to the Atlanta HIDTA region. The large quantities of cocaine available in the area, the level of violence associated with cocaine (particularly crack) distribution and abuse, and the number of cocaine-related treatment admissions to publicly funded facilities are indications that cocaine is a greater drug threat than any other illicit drug. According to data from the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) National Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) 2009, 14 of the 31 law enforcement agency respondents in Georgia counties in the Atlanta HIDTA region report that cocaine is the greatest drug threat in their jurisdictions, and 15 of the 16 respondents in North Carolina counties in the HIDTA region report that cocaine is the greatest drug threat in their jurisdictions.3 Shortages in wholesale quantities of powder cocaine first noted in 2007 continued to be reported by some law enforcement officers in the Atlanta HIDTA region in 2008. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Atlanta Field Division reported limited availability of cocaine in the Atlanta HIDTA region in 2008. Also the Greensboro Police Department in North Carolina reported that some retail-level distributors were selling fake cocaine as a result of the cocaine shortages in the area in late 2008 and early 2009. Wholesale cocaine prices also reflect the shortages: wholesale prices remain high, and cocaine sold for as much as $25,000 per kilogram in 2008.4 Nonetheless, some law enforcement agencies in the Atlanta HIDTA region report that quantities of cocaine are sufficient to meet local demand and to distribute to other markets, such as Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, and Birmingham. Reporting from Atlanta HIDTA Initiatives5 indicates that over 817 kilograms of powder cocaine were seized in 2008. (See Table 1.), 2685=Ã‚Â  National Drug Intelligence Center Ã‚Â  Atlanta High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Drug Market Analysis 2009 Ã‚Â  April 2009}","{10954=Street gangs distribute illicit drugs at the retail level in many areas of the Atlanta HIDTA region; the level of drug distribution by street gangs is generally moderate to high in the region. According to NDTS 2009 data, 20 of the 47 law enforcement agency respondents in the Atlanta HIDTA region report that the level of gang drug activity increased in their jurisdictions during the past year. This increased activity most likely is the result of an increase in the supply of illicit drugs by Mexican DTOs to street gangs in the region. Street gang activity is prevalent among African American and Hispanic youths in the Atlanta HIDTA region. Most street gangs in Atlanta are locally based; they commonly adopt multiple facets of gang culture from national-level street gangs that members often garner from the Internet. Moreover, local gangs typically do not exhibit the organizational structure, written code, or defined member roles associated with national-level street gangs. African American street gangs such as Most Dangerous Click (MDC), Dangerous Killer Click, and 30 Deep typically distribute crack cocaine and marijuana at the retail level; these street gangs depend on Mexican traffickers as their source for powder cocaine, which they generally convert to crack cocaine. Hispanic street gangs such as SureÃ¯Â¿Â½os 13 (Sur 13) and Vatos Locos maintain a strong presence in the Atlanta HIDTA region; they typically distribute cocaine and marijuana obtained from Mexican DTOs. Hispanic street gangs appear to be more organized than African American street gangs and exhibit more violence in direct support of their drug distribution activities. The presence of Mara Salvatrucha (MS 13) in North Carolina and Georgia is growing. Law enforcement officials report increased coordination of criminal activity among MS 13 cliques in the Atlanta metropolitan area., 12861=3. National Drug Threat Survey (NDTS) data for 2009 cited in this report are as of February 12, 2009. NDTS data cited are raw, unweighted responses from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies solicited through either the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) or the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program. Data cited may include responses from agencies that are part of the NDTS 2009 national sample and/or agencies that are part of HIDTA solicitation lists. 4. Intelligence and law enforcement reporting indicates that the decrease in cocaine availability in U.S. drug markets was most likely the result of several simultaneous factors that obstructed the flow of cocaine from South America through Mexico to U.S. drug markets. The probable factors include several exceptionally large cocaine seizures made while the drug was in transit to the United States, counterdrug efforts by the Mexican Government, U.S. law enforcement operations along the Southwest Border, a high level of intercartel violence in Mexico, and expanding cocaine markets in Europe and South America. It is unclear which of these factors contributed most to the decrease in cocaine availability. 5. Atlanta HIDTA funds are allocated to nine initiatives (program areas): Metro Atlanta Task Force, DeKalb Task Force, Intelligence, Administration, Crime Lab, Prosecution, Training, Facilities, and Prevention. Initiatives contain subcategories such as Groups 1 through 6 within the Metro Atlanta Task Force. 6. Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) data are available only at the state level; thus, the number of cannabis plants and grow sites eradicated and seized reflect the entire states of Georgia and North Carolina, not just the Atlanta HIDTA region. 7. Not all prescription drugs are controlled prescription drugs (CPDs) under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). However, many prescription drugs are listed in Schedules I through V of the CSA because of their high potential for abuse or addiction. Schedule I through V prescription drugs are primarily narcotic pain relievers and central nervous system depressants and stimulants. A complete list of CPDs, by schedule, is available on the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Office of Diversion Control web site at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/schedules.htm. 8. Schedule II drugs include several prescription drugs such as Duragesic (fentanyl), methadone, morphine, OxyContin (oxycodone), and Percocet (oxycodone in combination with acetaminophen). Schedule III drugs include several prescription drugs such as Vicodin (hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen). Schedule IV drugs include several prescription drugs such as Ambien (zolpidem), Ativan (lorazepam), Darvon (propoxyphene), Valium (diazepam), and Xanax (alprazolam). 9. Combination tablets that contain MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as ecstasy) and methamphetamine or other substances have been transported south across the U.S.-Canada border since at least 2000. Various data suggest that the flow of MDMA tablets from Canada to the United States has been consistently increasing since 2003, and it is highly likely that the flow of combination tablets has risen at the same time., 7913=Mexican DTOs dominate the wholesale distribution of cocaine, ice methamphetamine, and marijuana; they exert more influence over illicit drug trafficking in the Atlanta HIDTA region than any other trafficking organization or group. Mexican DTOs use a complex network of transportation and distribution cells to coordinate drug shipments from sources of supply operating in California, Texas, or Mexico to the HIDTA region. Law enforcement reporting indicates that Mexican DTOs located along the Southwest Border or in Mexico often manage cell leaders in the region. In addition to the Atlanta area, Mexican drug trafficking cells in North Carolina are using cities such as Charlotte as drug distribution centers. To illustrate, in July 2008, Tennessee law enforcement officials stopped a vehicle for speeding along I-40. A search of the vehicle revealed 20 kilograms of Mexican black tar heroin in a hidden compartment. The driver and passenger of the vehicle, both Mexican citizens, admitted that they were traveling from Charlotte to Tacoma, Washington., 3686=Cannabis cultivation and subsequent marijuana distribution and abuse pose serious threats to the Atlanta HIDTA region. Marijuana is widely available throughout the HIDTA region and is abused by members of all racial/ethnic and social groups. Most of the marijuana available in the region is produced in Mexico or Canada, but some is produced locally at outdoor and indoor cannabis grow sites. Most cannabis cultivated in the Atlanta HIDTA region is grown at outdoor sites; however, severe drought conditions throughout the southeastern United States in 2007 caused a sharp decrease in the amount of cannabis cultivated and eradicated in Georgia, North Carolina, and the Atlanta HIDTA region during the year. Despite a continued drought, growing conditions improved in 2008, leading to increased cannabis eradication in Georgia, North Carolina, and the Atlanta HIDTA region during the year. According to Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) data,6 the number of cultivated plants eradicated from outdoor grow operations in Georgia increased from 11,851 plants in 2007 to 47,607 plants in 2008, and the number of cultivated plants eradicated from outdoor grow operations in North Carolina increased from 15,115 plants in 2007 to 103,711 plants in 2008. Eradication data suggest that indoor cannabis cultivation, however, decreased significantly in Georgia, including Georgia counties in the Atlanta HIDTA region. According to DCE/SP data, the number of cultivated plants eradicated from indoor grow operations in Georgia decreased from 9,585 plants in 2007 to 2,840 plants in 2008. Law enforcement reporting suggests that this decrease can be partially attributed to effective law enforcement investigations in 2007 that targeted large Cuban DTO-operated indoor cannabis grow operations in Georgia. However, the number of cultivated plants eradicated from indoor grow operations in North Carolina increased from 1,253 plants in 2007 to 1,489 plants in 2008. Many of the indoor grow sites seized in Georgia and North Carolina in 2008 were small, independent grow sites that cultivated personal use quantities of cannabis., 2470=The production, trafficking, and abuse of powder and ice methamphetamine pose a significant threat to the Atlanta HIDTA region. According to data from the NDTS 2009, 6 of the 47 law enforcement agency respondents in the Atlanta HIDTA region report that powder methamphetamine is the greatest drug threat, and 4 respondents report the same for ice methamphetamine. Locally produced powder methamphetamine and high-purity Mexican ice methamphetamine are available to varying degrees throughout the Atlanta HIDTA region. According to data from the NDTS 2009, 28 of the 47 law enforcement agency respondents in the Atlanta HIDTA region report that ice methamphetamine is available at moderate to high levels, and 26 report the same for powder methamphetamine. Mexican DTOs supply significant quantities of powder and ice methamphetamine to the Atlanta HIDTA region. Methamphetamine is also produced in the Atlanta HIDTA region at low to moderate levels; however, methamphetamine laboratory seizure data suggest rising methamphetamine production throughout North Carolina. This increased production may subsequently lead to increased methamphetamine availability in the Atlanta HIDTA counties in North Carolina.}","Table 1.

Nintendo Adventure Books[edit] In Unjust Desserts, some Sumo Brothers shrunken by Magikoopa are eaten by Yoshi, and two confront Mario in a tunnel inside the dinosaur. Mario defeats the two by jumping out of the way when they charge at him, causing them to crash into each other and become knocked out. If Mario smashes a Blue Shell thrown at him by a Koopa Troopa, the Sumo Brothers will awaken, but before they can renew their assault, they are sent tumbling down a passageway when the newly Winged Yoshi does a loop-the-loop. Later, some more Sumo Brothers try to attack Mario when he and Bowser's minions are forcibly ejected from Yoshi's body, but because they are still tiny, they are scared off by the seemingly giant Yoshi stomping around. In Brain Drain, a Sumo Brother will swap minds with Wooster if he hears the static emanated by","Trivia[edit] The Super Mario World artwork of the Sumo Brothers lacks the spike on their heads. However, the spike is present in the games and in the cartoon.

-> Ã‚Â With more than two million copies sold, Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? has opened up a world of learning to a generation of children. For this edition, created for the twenty-fifth anniversay in 1992, Bill Martin, Jr., restored his text to its original wording. And Eric Carle created all new pictures--based on the originals, but clearer, brighter, and truer to the colors they represent. Bill Martin has been devoted to writing children's books for more than thirty years.

And while it was nice to see him go off for 195 yards and two TDs Sunday, he's still on pace for just 1,385 yards from scrimmage and 4.6 scores, hardly first Ã¯Â¿Â½ or even second Ã¯Â¿Â½ round material. But the player I felt I should have taken Ã¯Â¿Â½ as the big five (Arian Foster, Ray Rice, LeSean McCoy, Calvin Johnson and Aaron Rodgers were gone) and I didn't want to spend an early pick on a QB Ã¯Â¿Â½ was Darren McFadden, who's on pace for 1,309 yards from scrimmage and 5.3 scores. In other words, he's been about exactly equal to Johnson. Other running backs I could have taken there Ã¯Â¿Â½ DeMarco Murray, Matt Forte, Trent Richardson and Maurice Jones-Drew Ã¯Â¿Â½ haven't fared much better and in some cases would have been quite a bit worse. Marshawn Lynch, Adrian Peterson and Jamaal Charles were probably the best bets from the second tier, but I can't recall anyone taking them at 1.6. My No. 2 WR was A.J. Green who would have made a fine pick there, but I got him in the second round in one of those leagues anyway. And neither of the top two tight ends Ã¯Â¿Â½ Jimmy Graham and Rob Gronkowski Ã¯Â¿Â½ has lived up to his late-first/early-second round draft slot, let alone No. 6 overall. My No. 2 QB, Tom Brady, has been similarly pedestrian. In the end, while waiting on quarterbacks might have been the right strategy generally Ã¯Â¿Â½ considering how late one could get Robert Griffin, III, Andrew Luck and Andy Dalton Ã¯Â¿Â½ the right pick at 1.6 was Drew Brees. So Much for the Depth at Tight End Heading into the season, the question was whether to spend a late-first or early-second round pick on the historically good Graham or Gronkowski, use a fourth or fifth rounder on the next tier Ã¯Â¿Â½ Antonio Gates and Aaron Hernandez Ã¯Â¿Â½ or pass on all of them given the extraordinary depth at the position. It turns out Ã¯Â¿Â½ much like drafting at 1.6 Ã¯Â¿Â½ there weren't a lot of good options. If you sprung for any of the top four, you can't be happy, though Gronkowski at least is on a pace for 1,000 yards and 11 scores, which you can live with in Round 2, especially given how badly Graham, Hernandez, Gates, Vernon Davis, Jermichael Finley and Fred Davis have been. If you waited and took Brandon Pettigrew, Greg Olsen, Jermaine Gresham or Jason Witten, you got very little from the position, but at least you wasted a mid-to-late round pick. The only significant sources of profit are Tony Gonzalez, Owen Daniels and Heath Miller. I suppose you could count Kyle Rudolph in TD-heavy leagues, too. Particles and Waves I wrote about this four years ago, but the analogy occurred to me a little differently this time. While matter can be viewed as static (particles) or dynamic (waves), so can NFL teams and players. We can take a particle-like view Ã¯Â¿Â½ ""Shonn Greene's a plodder"", ""Chris Johnson has lost a step"" Ã¯Â¿Â½ or we view them more as waves whose skill sets fluctuate, based not only on health and role, but also on system, play-calling, game-situation and team context. I wrote as much four years ago, but it occurred to me not all waves are of equal size or duration. Drew Bennett had a monster three-game stretch Ã¯Â¿Â½ 28-517-8 Ã¯Â¿Â½ in 2004 and then failed to eclipse 100 yards in any game in 2005. The wave was huge, but it didn't last very long. When the Patriots upset the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, it seemed to many like a fluke. But that wave Ã¯Â¿Â½ the Patriots being an elite team Ã¯Â¿Â½ still has not broken yet. When you consider that player and team success range from a few-game stretch where a doormat gives contenders a hard time before returning from whence it came to a decade-long dynasty, it seems prudent to evaluate team (and player) strength based on a variable rather than fixed sample of games. Put differently, if we want to know how good the Giants defense is, do we evaluate its performance since Week 1 when they were missing Prince Amukamara, Jayron Hosley (and Michael Coe) and were forced to use special teamer Justin Tryon in coverage? Or do we start in Week 3, or Week 4? If you've evaluating Jordy Nelson going forward, do we average his production from the start of the season or just the last few games since the Packers offensive line has played better? These aren't easy questions to answer. If we arbitrarily choose our end points on a case-by-case basis, we can make Bennett seem like the greatest receiver of all time. So it's probably safer just to pick the duration of games that on average seems to be most predictive of performance going forward. But whenever you use an average, you risk including some bad data that no longer applies to the present circumstances. The rule should probably be something like: Use the last 10 games with the most recent 3-5 getting more weight unless something significant has changed in which case you customize your sample size. The problem then becomes identifying what's a significant change and what isn't, i.e, when to customize and when to use the average. But solving that isn't necessarily any easier than the problem of evaluating a team or player in the first place. Things to Take Away from Week 7 Ã¯Â¿Â½ Robert Griffin III converted a ridiculous 4th-and-10 play with the game on the line while spinning and changing directions to avoid Jason Pierre-Paul and Justin Tuck. Griffin is exceeding the substantial hype preceding his arrival into the league, and if I were to pick a QB to run my real-life franchise for this year only, I'd already take him ahead of Matt Ryan, Matthew Stafford, Joe Flacco and maybe Tony Romo and Philip Rivers. In fantasy, I think only Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers can be safely ranked ahead of him. Consider also that RGIII has missed his top receiver Pierre Garcon for most of the year and his No. 2 target Fred Davis for some of it (and now the rest of it). Ã¯Â¿Â½ Victor Cruz is the rare top-five real life NFL receiver who doesn't have elite size or speed. What he does have is decent size, good speed, elite quickness and great hands. He's a bigger, faster just as shifty version of Wes Welker. Ã¯Â¿Â½ Eli Manning had a subpar game, throwing two picks and missing some wide open targets. But he made the big throw when it counted, and no one ever worries about him anymore. Ã¯Â¿Â½ It wasn't surprising Trent Richardson couldn't seriously play with damaged rib cartilage Ã¯Â¿Â½ it sounded fishy the entire week. But even the ostensibly healthy Montario Hardesty got just seven carries for 28 yards against a Colts defense that plodding Shonn Greene shredded last week. Or so we thought that was the takeway. But maybe it wasn't merely that the Colts defense was bad, but that the Jets offensive line is starting to play better. Greene ran for just 54 yards on 16 carries against a stout New England front, but he looked nimble on a few runs and also caught six passes for 34 yards, while the offense moved the ball consistently. Ã¯Â¿Â½ Mark Sanchez played well Sunday, getting eight yards per attempt and leading the Jets comeback. Were it not for a terrible Stephen Hill drop, the Jets might even have won the game. Still, Hill showed the ability to get open, and Jeremy Kerley and Dustin Keller were also significantly involved. It doesn't seem like Santonio Holmes will be particularly missed. Ã¯Â¿Â½ You don't often see the Ravens on the wrong side of blowouts like this. The Texans made the Green Bay loss seem like an anomaly, though another reading is that maybe the Packers are just that good Ã¯Â¿Â½ after all, they essentially blew out the Rams in St. Louis, too, and no one had beaten up the Rams except the Bears in Chicago on a fourth quarter pick six. The 30-20 score was actually due to the Rams getting points in garbage time. Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Seahawks dominated the 49ers in the first half Thursday night and would have had a significant lead but for some terrible dropped passes. Russell Wilson has a cannon even when throwing on the move, something that reminds one of Michael Vick, though Wilson trades some foot speed for accuracy. The 49ers took over in the second half, mostly behind Frank Gore who looked like he was in his prime against one of the league's top run defenses. Of course, he hurt his ribs in the fourth quarter, but has 10 days to get ready for Week 8. Ã¯Â¿Â½ One of the greatest moments in gambling history occurred at the end of that game, and even though I had the 49ers and lost when Jim Harbaugh declined the holding penalty (and hence the safety), no one can take away the 30 seconds of elation between the flag and seeing it declined. It was miracle, albeit a temporary one. Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Vikings won even though Christian Ponder passed for 58 yards and threw two picks. Ã¯Â¿Â½ Josh Freeman had a huge fantasy day, but the guy seems like he's moving in slow motion, whether it's taking an hour to survey the field or taking an eon to line up and run a play with the clock winding down. And Greg Schiano is so old school it seems like he's adapted his playbook from stone age cave scrawlings. ""Smash rock into end zone."" Finally after wasting three goal-to-go plays from the one, the Bucs had Freeman roll out at 3 mph. It was like watching Philip Rivers run the ball if Rivers were straining to stay continent. Ã¯Â¿Â½ With Jimmy Graham out, Lance Moore looked like Victor Cruz, getting open at will and plucking nine of 10 targets out of the air for 121 yards. Ã¯Â¿Â½ The only thing keeping the Bucs in the game was the Saints playing ""allow"" defense, a variation of ""prevent"" where you take away no part of the field because you can always shove a receiver out of bounds who will be penalized if he catches the ball. Things to Look for in Week 8 Ã¯Â¿Â½ The undefeated Falcons take their smoke and mirrors act to Philadelphia. Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Giants head to Dallas with a 1.5 game lead in the NFC East. Ã¯Â¿Â½ The Saints take their offense-only game to Denver in a reprise of the Super Bowl 44 quarterback matchup. Beating the Book Falcons +1.5 at Eagles The Eagles are a frustrating team with all the turnovers and bad clock management, but Andy Reid is 13-0 in his career off a bye week, and the Falcons are not nearly as good as their 6-0 record, having barely beaten the Raiders and Panthers at home in recent weeks. Back the Eagles who roll. Eagles 34 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 16 Last week we lost with the Bills to put us at 3-4 on the season in this forum and 50-51-3 overall. Last year we went 10-7 in this forum and 124-125 overall. Over the last five years we've gone 50-34 in this space. You can read the full Week 6 column here. Surviving Week 8 Last week, I wound up taking the Vikings (indecisiveness kept me away from the Niners on Thursday night and a sense that more people would be on the Patriots than the early polling showed kept me off the Pats), but nearly everyone made it through. Let's take a look at this week's slate:}","Revisiting Pick 1.6 In Week 2, I wrote about how I already regretted taking Chris Johnson at 1.6 in two NFFC leagues. And while it was nice to see him go off for 195 yards and two TDs Sunday, he's still on pace for just 1,385 yards from scrimmage and 4.6 scores, hardly first Ã¯Â¿Â½ or even second Ã¯Â¿Â½ round material. But the player I felt I should have taken Ã¯Â¿Â½ as the big five (Arian Foster, Ray Rice, LeSean McCoy, Calvin Johnson and Aaron Rodgers were gone) and I didn't want to spend an early pick on a QB Ã¯Â¿Â½ was Darren McFadden, who's on pace for 1,309 yards from scrimmage and 5.3 scores. In other words, he's been about exactly equal to Johnson. Other running backs I could have taken there Ã¯Â¿Â½ DeMarco Murray, Matt Forte, Trent Richardson and Maurice Jones-Drew Ã¯Â¿Â½ haven't fared much better and in some cases would have been quite a bit worse. Marshawn Lynch, Adrian Peterson and Jamaal Charles were probably the best bets from the second tier, but I can't recall anyone taking them at 1.6. My No. 2 WR was A.J. Green who would have made a fine pick there, but I got him in the second round in one of those leagues anyway. And neither of the top two tight ends Ã¯Â¿Â½","Home Team in CAPS * according to OfficeFootballPools.com ** average of the two moneylines First off, there was no moneyline available for Green Bay-Jacksonville, so I made it up. Ninety percent is pretty aggressive, but in this case it's conservative because you want to make the case against the Packers given their 63-percent popularity while giving them their strongest possible chance to win. Moreover, with the Jaguars down to their second-string QB and missing arguably their best player in Maurice Jones-Drew, 90 percent might be accurate. Let's assume our standard 100-person pool with a $10 entry fee. If you take the Bears, they win and Green Bay loses, then there are only 37 people left. Your pool equity goes from $10 to $27. If you take the Packers and Chicago loses, your equity goes from $10 to $11.36. 27/11.36 equals 2.38. In other words, the payout with Chicago is 2.38 times as good as the payout from taking Green Bay. But the Packers have only a 10 percent chance to lose, while the Bears have a 23.81 percent chance to lose. That's 2.38 times as much. What does that mean? It means if you accept these numbers, we have a tie. You can either play it safe and get a safe return, or take a risk and a chance for a bigger return. But in terms of expected",True,0,0,

Since Fund records did not reflect his ownership interest, you wrote to Mr. Baer to request verification of his ownership. Mr. Baer faxed to the Fund a letter from his broker stating that Mr. Baer was the beneficial owner of Fund shares worth over $2,000 as of July 12, 2001, and that the shares had been held for at least a year. You state that this letter was inadequate to verify eligibility to submit the Proposal. You notified Mr. Baer of the deficiency in the broker's letter and requested a letter from the broker verifying that Mr. Baer ""continuously owned shares worth at least $2,000 from June 18, 2000 to June 18, 2001."" On August 8, 2001, Mr. Baer faxed you a second letter from his broker stating that Mr. Baer was the owner of Fund shares worth over $2,000 as of August 6, 2001, and that the shares were held continuously since prior to June 18, 2000. You argue that the second broker letter also was inadequate to verify Mr. Baer's eligibility to submit the Proposal because you interpret rule 14a-8(b)(2) to require that Mr. Baer prove that the Fund shares owned by him were worth $2,000 at all times from June 18, 2000 through June 18, 2001. You also argue that Mr. Baer was not timely in responding to the Fund's second letter., 18396=Again, although not required to do so under the Securities Act, on August 9, 2001 I once more contacted Mr. Baer in an attempt to help Mr. Baer prove proper ownership. In a telephone call with Mr. Baer, I suggested that he and I talk to Brown & Company together, so that the broker could understand what information we were seeking. Mr. Baer found my request to be ""extremely technical,"" and refused to contact Brown & Company again so as to request that they send the proper proof of ownership., 2770=Bruce G. Leto, Esq. Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young, LLP 2600 One Commerce Square Philadelphia, PA. 19103-7098, 10301=August 13, 2001, 18917=The Fund notes that this is not a situation where a proponent is unfamiliar with the rules governing submissions of shareholder proposals and has failed to satisfy a technical requirement out of ignorance. On the contrary, Mr. Baer is an experienced shareholder who previously has submitted proposals to various registrants.1 During our August 9th telephone conversation, Mr. Baer insisted that he was a knowledgeable and experienced advocate for shareholder's rights. The Fund went above and beyond the requirements of the Securities Act in a good faith attempt to help Mr. Baer establish proof of his eligibility to submit a proposal as specifically required by the proxy rules. The Fund offered Mr. Baer two 14 day periods in which to establish his eligibility and, in both instances, Mr. Baer failed to provide the required information., 8173=Under the circumstances, we cannot assure you that we would not recommend enforcement action if the Fund omits the Proposal in reliance on rules14a-8 (f) under the 1934 Act., 7597=We believe that the second letter from Mr. Baer's broker satisfies the requirements of rule 14a-8(b) because it establishes ownership of Fund shares from June 18, 2000 through August 6, 2001, and it provides sufficient information for the Fund to determine that Mr. Baer's shares were worth at least $2,000 as of a date within the 60-day window before submission of his Proposal.2 We also believe that Mr. Baer responded in a timely manner.3, 22228=For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the staff concur in our opinion that the Proposal may be properly excluded from the Fund's 2001 Proxy Materials. We would be happy to provide you with any additional information and answer any questions that you may have regarding this subject. Should you disagree with the conclusions set forth herein, we respectfully request the opportunity to confer with you prior to the determination of the staff's final position., 19863=The Staff has consistently taken the position that a proposal may be excluded under Rule 14a-8(f) if a proponent fails to provide sufficient evidence that it satisfies the eligibility requirements under Rule 14a-8(b). Among the recent Commission no-action letters to this effect are: Oracle Corp. (pub. avail. June 22, 2001), General Motors Corporation (pub. avail. Apr. 3, 2001), Bank of America Corporation (pub. avail. Feb. 12, 2001), Eastman Kodak Company (pub. avail. Feb. 7, 2001), Eastman Kodak Company (Service Employees Int'l.) (pub. avail. Feb. 5, 2001), and The Coca-Cola Company (pub. avail. Jan. 19, 2001)., 3115=In a letter dated August 13, 2001, you notified the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Fund proposes to omit from its proxy materials for its 2001 annual meeting a shareholder proposal (the ""Proposal"") submitted by Walter S. Baer (the ""Proponent""). The Proposal provides:, 10119=Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young, LLP 2600 One Commerce Square Philadelphia, PA 19103-7098 Telephone (215) 564-8000 Fax (215) 564-8120, 20532=Mr. Baer is responsible for ensuring that adequate evidence of eligibility has been furnished. Where the failure to provide the required evidence is attributable to the actions of the broker rather than a proponent, the Staff recognizes that the requirements of Rule 14a-8(b) are not satisfied and permits exclusion of the proposal. See, e.g., Oracle Corp. (pub. avail. June 22, 2001), General Motors Corporation (pub. avail. Apr. 3, 2001), Bank of America Corporation (pub. avail. Feb. 12, 2001), Eastman Kodak Company (pub. avail. Feb. 7, 2001), and Eastman Kodak Company (Service Employees Int'l.) (pub. avail. Feb. 5, 2001). Since it is Mr. Baer's responsibility to ensure that adequate evidence of eligibility is provided, and because Mr. Baer failed to provide such evidence, we believe that we may properly exclude the Proposal from the 2001 Proxy Materials., 3779=You request our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action if the Fund omits the Proposal in reliance on rules 14a-8(b) and 14a-8(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""1934 Act"").1, 15741=As a result of the deficiency of the First Brown Letter, Mr. Baer failed to adequately prove to the Fund his share ownership within 14 days of the First Fund Letter. Although the Fund was not required to do so under the Securities Act, the Fund made a good faith attempt to permit Mr. Baer to correct this error. By letter dated July 24, 2001, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D (the ""Second Fund Letter""), in accordance with Rule 14a-8(f)(1), I notified Mr. Baer that the First Brown Letter failed to prove his eligibility as required by Rule 14a-8(b). I requested that Mr. Baer provide a written statement from Brown & Company verifying that he continuously owned shares worth at least $2,000 from June 18, 2000 through June 18, 2001. Moreover, I notified Mr. Baer that he had an additional 14 days to respond to this second request. Mr. Baer received this letter via facsimile on July 24, 2001. Once again, Mr. Baer failed to provide within 14 days of receipt of the Second Fund letter, a written statement verifying that, at the time the Proposal was submitted, he had continuously held shares of at least $2,000 in market value for at least one year from the date he submitted the Proposal., 6657=We do not agree with your interpretation of the requirements of rule 14a-8(b). We believe that the second letter from Mr. Baer's broker complies with the requirements of the rule. The staff has long taken the position that in order to determine whether the shareholder satisfies the $2,000 threshold, we look at whether, on any date within the 60 calendar days before the date the shareholder submits the proposal, the shareholder's investment is valued at $2,000 or greater, based on the average of the bid and ask prices. For exchange traded securities, such as the Fund's, one would determine the market value by multiplying the number of securities the shareholder held for the one-year period by the highest selling price during the 60 calendar days before the shareholder submitted the proposal. See Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14 (CF) dated July 13, 2001 and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-20091, August 16, 1983., 16978=On August 8, 2001, 15 days after receiving the Second Fund Letter via facsimile, Mr. Baer faxed to me a letter from Brown & Company, (the ""Second Brown Letter""). A copy of that facsimile and the Second Brown Letter are attached hereto as Exhibit E. The Second Brown Letter stated that Mr. Baer was the beneficial owner of Fund shares with a market value of over $2,000 as of August 6, 2001 and that these shares had been held continuously since June 18, 2000. Once again, the Second Brown Letter clearly failed to verify, as required by Rule 14a-8(b)(2), that, at the time he submitted the Proposal, Mr. Baer continuously held shares worth $2,000 for at least one year. At most, the Second Brown Letter demonstrates that Mr. Baer held shares worth $2,000 on August 6, 2001 and that he held them for one year. However, depending upon prevailing market prices, the shares worth $2,000 on August 6, 2001 may not have been worth $2,000 at all times from June 18, 2000 through June 18, 2001. Without a statement to this effect from Brown & Company, and without written proof as to the exact number of shares held by Mr. Baer, the Fund was unable to determine that Mr. Baer met the requirements of Rule 14a-8(b). In any event, the Second Brown Letter was not received within the required 14 day time period. Thus, Mr. Baer has clearly failed to establish that he is eligible to submit the Proposal., 14073=Mr. Baer, in the Proposal, dated June 11, 2001 and received by the Fund on June 18, 2001, stated that he held for at least one year shares of the Fund with a market value of $2,000, and that he intended to hold those shares continuously through the date of the Meeting. The Fund's shareholder records did not reflect that Mr. Baer was a record holder of the Fund's shares. Accordingly, on behalf of the Fund, on June 27, 2001, I wrote to Mr. Baer (the ""First Fund Letter"") and requested that he verify his eligibility to submit the Proposal by providing the Fund with evidence of his share ownership in accordance with Rule 14a-8. In the First Fund Letter (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B), which was received by Mr. Baer no later than July 9, 2001, I informed Mr. Baer that he had 14 days to respond to my request. On July 16, 2001, I received a fax from Mr. Baer which included a letter from Brown & Company (the ""First Brown Letter"") which stated that Mr. Baer was the beneficial owner of shares of the Fund with a market value of over $2,000 as of the closing price on July 12, 2001. The First Brown Letter also stated that the shares had been held for at least one year. A copy of the fax and the First Brown Letter are attached hereto as Exhibit C. The Fund was unable to determine from the First Brown Letter that Mr. Baer had continuously held $2,000 worth of shares for the entire year. The fact that Mr. Baer's shares were worth $2,000 on July 12, 2001 does not indicate that at all times from June 18, 2000 through June 18, 2001 these shares were both continuously held, and were worth at least $2,000., 2909=September 28, 2001, 10707=I am a partner with Stradley, Ronon, Stevens & Young, LLP, which serves as outside counsel to the Templeton Vietnam and Southeast Asia Fund, Inc. (the ""Fund""). I am writing on behalf of the Fund to request the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") staff's confirmation that it will take no action if the Fund, pursuant to Rule 14a-8(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the ""Securities Act"") omits a shareholder proposal and supporting statement submitted to the Fund by Mr. Walter S. Baer (the ""Proposal"") from its proxy statement and form of proxy (""Proxy Materials""). Mr. Baer's letter setting forth the Proposal is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The specific reasons for the Fund's position are set forth below. The annual meeting of shareholders (the ""Meeting"") is scheduled for November 30, 2001 and the Fund plans to mail definitive Proxy Materials in October, 2001. The Fund respectfully requests that the Commission staff respond to this letter prior to September 15, 2001, to enable the Fund sufficient time to provide Mr. Baer with a copy of the Fund's opposition statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8(m)(3) in the event that the Fund is required to include the Proposal in the Proxy Materials.}","You request our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action if the Fund omits the Proposal in reliance on rules 14a-8(b) and 14a-8(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""1934 Act"").1 Rules 14a-8(b) and 14a-8(f) You assert that the Proposal may be properly excluded pursuant to rule 14a-8(f) because Mr. Baer failed to demonstrate eligibility under rule 14a-8(b). You state that the rule requires Mr. Baer to provide proof that, at the time he submitted the Proposal, he had continuously held at least $2,000 in market value or 1% of the company's securities for at least one year. If Mr. Baer is not the registered holder of the Fund's securities, he must prove eligibility by submitting evidence from the record holder of his securities. You further state that the Fund may exclude the Proposal if Mr. Baer fails to comply with rule 14a-8(b), but only after the Fund notifies him of the deficiency within 14 days of receiving the Proposal and he fails to correct such deficiency within 14 days of receipt of the Fund's notification. It is your contention that Mr. Baer failed to correct the procedural deficiency identified by the Fund in the requisite time and, therefore, the Fund may exclude his Proposal from its proxy materials. Background In his Proposal (received by the Fund on June 18, 2001), Mr. Baer stated that he held $2,000 worth of Fund shares for at least one year and he intended to hold the shares","Ã‚Â  Exhibit C: First Brown Letter Ã‚Â  Exhibit D: Second Fund Letter Ã‚Â  Exhibit E: Second Brown Letter cc (w/encls.): via federal express: Walter S.

For example, among the asteroids there are none which have periods which are 1/3, 1/2 and 2/5 of that of Jupiter. The absence of asteroids at or near the resonance points are what are known as the Kirkwood Gaps, named after the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood who discovered the phenomenon in 1886. Here is the plot of the orbit size of about 157 thousand asteroids., 22535=As asserted before, the derivation would apply to any satellite system and that would include the planetary systems of other stars. In the December 6, 2008 issue of Science News it was reported that images of three planets were found for the star HR8799 which lies about 130 light-years from our solar system. The planets are massive, one having 10 times the mass of Jupiter., 20160=Using the value of b=2.23494 would give a value of 1.7094 instead of 1.732773. This is notably close. Here is the comparison of the actual orbit radii and the values computed from the equation, both expressed in Astronomical Units (A.U.), distance relative to Earth's orbit radius., 7896=In the rings of Saturn there is a gap of 1700 miles that corresponds to 1/2 the period of the moon Mimas, 1/3 the period of Enceladus and 1/4 the period of Tethys., 2394=This is a derivation of the relationships of orbit radii and periods of revolution to the order number of the orbits for the planets and their satellite systems. Ever since 1768 when Johann Bode published the remarkable empirical relationship for distances of the planets from the Sun astronomers have puzzled over whether there is any physical justification for it. Bode did not originate the relationship; he only publicized it. Johann Titius in 1766 had earlier stated it in a footnote of his translation of a 1764 book by Charles Bonnet. Apparently the earliest statement of the relationship was by David Gregory in 1715. The relationship of the orbit radii of the planets given as ratios to that of Earth's orbit radius is:}",where n is the order number of the orbit starting with n=1 for Mercury. The relationship posits a planetary orbit number 5 where the asteroid belt is. The empirical fit is quite striking.

The relationship of the orbit radii of the planets given as ratios to that of Earth's orbit radius is: A Derivation of Titius-Bode Type Relations for the Planets of the Solar System and Satellite Systems of the Planets applet-magic.com Thayer Watkins Silicon Valley & Tornado Alley USA San JosÃƒÂ©,"It is often said that there is no theoretical basis for this relationship. While the form Rn=c+a*bn does not have a theoretical justification there is justification of a relationship of the form Rn=a*bn. This will be given below. For the solar system and some of the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus each planet or satellite is roughly twice as far from the system center as the preceding satellite. (For more on the relationships which exists for the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus see Bode2.) There has to be a physical explanation for this pattern. And there is. The explanation is in terms of resonance. The explanation is not in terms of radii per se; it is in terms of orbit periods. There is of course a relationship between orbit period and orbit radius, called Kepler's Law, which says the cube of orbit radius is proportional to the square of orbit period. The physical process accounting for the radii at which planets formed involves their orbit periods. The original system was a planetary ring rotating about the Sun not as a unit but instead with Kepler's Law satisfied. Once one planet was formed any planetary material having an orbit period equal to one half the orbit period of the planet would be nudged out of its orbit. This is the phenomenon of resonance. If any two bits of matter are in orbits such that one makes two revolution about the Sun for every one",True,0,0,

The planets acquired not only mass but angular momentum in this process. See Planetary Sweep. Here are the ratios of the orbit period of the next closer to the Sun to each planet's orbit period. The ratio of the period for the planet next farther away from the Sun to the period for the planet is called the Reciprocal Ratio in the table.

In the rings of Saturn there is a gap of 1700 miles that corresponds to 1/2 the period of the moon Mimas, 1/3 the period of Enceladus and 1/4 the period of Tethys. However it seemed paradoxical that planets are found close to the forbidden resonance bands. This is no paradox. The planetary material did not have to move very far from the forbiddedn resonance zone to break the resonance. However when the planetary material moved away from its original orbit it would be moving at a velocity different from that of the surrounding material. This led to collisions and agglomeration of material. As illustrated in the diagram the planetary material would be concentrated in the space near the resonance band. Thus planets would form near the resonance bands. It is often said that there is no theoretical","The average of the nine ratios given is 0.4736.

For order number 10 the equation gives a period of 361.56 years, whereas the period for Pluto is 248 years. 158.514 165 Neptune 69.4952 84 Uranus 30.4689 29.5 Saturn 13.3576 12.0 Jupiter 2.5675 1.9 Mars 1.1256 1.0000 Earth 0.4935 0.616 Venus 0.2164 0.2409 Mercury Computed Period (years) Orbit Period (years) Planet In the table Ceres was used as a representative of the asteroid belt. Four of the eight ratios are in the vicinity of 0.16=(0.4)Ã‚Â². One is close to 0.25=(0.5)Ã‚Â² and one close of 0.2=(0.4)(0.5). Only the ratios","For order number 10 the equation gives a distance of 50.75 whereas Pluto's distance is 39.5. For order number 5 the equation gives a distance of 3.249, whereas the distance of Ceres is 2.7. Other Satellite Systems Because of the nature of the derivation this type of relation should apply for any satellite system such as the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The corresponding regression equations for these systems are Jupiter: log10(T) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.6349 + 0.3026n RÃ‚Â² = 0.99668 Saturn: System I: log10(T) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.4363 + 0.2883n, RÃ‚Â² = 0.9954 System II: log10(T) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.3365 + 0.3076n RÃ‚Â² = 1.0000 Uranus log10(T) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.1077 + 0.2510n RÃ‚Â² = 0.9949 Although the regression coefficients for order number are significantly different from the value of 0.35 found for the planets the values of the same order of magnitude and reasonably close. The Planetary Systems of Other Stars As asserted before, the derivation would apply to any satellite system and that would include the planetary systems of other stars. In the December 6, 2008 issue of Science News it was reported that images of three planets were found for the star HR8799 which lies about 130 light-years from our solar system. The planets are massive, one having 10 times the mass of Jupiter. These planets lie 25, 40 and 70 astronomical units (A.U.) from their star. This means that, by Kepler's Law, their orbit periods",False,-1,0,

It trammed. It pulled. It took concentration to keep the car on the path over rough patches. At first I thought it a conspiracy of the 9-inch-wide Fikse wheels, grabby Goodyears, improper alignment, and quick 12:1 steering ratio. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t discover until much later that the bar was actually riding against the frame (it passes through elongated oval openings), thus merrily steering the car quite independently of the driver., 40928=When I bought this car in 1997, Global West maestro Doug Norrdin said he would prototype everything that heÃ¢Â€Â™d developed for A-bodies on the Biscayne and if IÃ¢Â€Â™d be willing to leave it with him for six months heÃ¢Â€Â™d have it shipshape. I politely declined, under the illusion that the car would be finished and IÃ¢Â€Â™d be burning rubber by then. It took another eight years before it got to that stage.}","We made some very stupid maneuvers in an effort to upset the cart but got squat in return. Judging by the feel of the car, the bar would be superfluous. The biggest sensation is felt at the rearend. The adjustable Panhard brace and bar really tie the car together. Bumpsteer has been distilled down to nothing. The Biscayne now feels like a modern car, quite the equal of high-zoot, American, Euro, or Asian counterpart. As a matter of fact, BMW dudes despise our big, white junk. It floors them. It brow-beats them. It makes people stay up at night. Surprise. The BiscayneÃ¢Â€Â™s weight distribution is 49/51, undoubtedly a product of its enormous rear overhang, big glass, rear-mount battery, and all-aluminum engine up front that weighs less than an iron small-block. People kill for numbers like this and the carÃ¢Â€Â™s handling demeanor is quite neutral. No amount of tomfoolery would call the back end around; although, anything better than a 6/10s effort would probably pendulum the rear of the car easily. Although Global has a rear-mount antisway bar (not attached to the lower control arm) for this conversion, it was deemed unnecessary. We had neither space nor the proper telemetry equipment to produce any kind of empirical data, so this is a seat-of-your-jeans take, a report based on driving thousands of new and modified cars. Did it on the street. Did it on an unoccupied thoroughfare with a series of switchbacks, damn difficult to find in Florida.

The application of a penetrating sealer is recommended in accordance with the sealer manufacturerÃ¢\x80\x99s instructions to further enhance the durability of the tile. Note: Always perform a sample test on an inconspicuous area, before applying the sealer on an entire tiled surface.', 'Ceramic Tile Installation The successful installation of ceramic tiles is highly affected by the installation process. Tierra y Fuego strongly recommends hiring or consulting a skilled professional tile installer, even for small projects. Tierra y Fuego is not liable for tile that has been altered from its original state due to improper handling during the installation process. Inspect the tile prior to installation as installation signifies acceptance. For a successful installation of Tierra y FuegoÃ¢\x80\x99s ceramic tiles, please take note of the following recommendations: Ã¢\x80Â¢ Carefully choose a skilled tile installer. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Properly blend all tiles prior to installation. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Make sure the installer is informed of all the procedures and products; and carefully follows the manufacturerÃ¢\x80\x99s instructions of any solutions such as sealers, grout releases, and cleaners that may be used or come in contact with the tile during the installation process. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Seal tiles with a penetrating sealer of your choice prior to grouting. We recommend 511 Impregnator Sealer from Miracle Sealants Company for medium to dense porous surfaces. Ã¢\x80Â¢ One important consideration as part of the tile selection process is the color of the grout. Depending on the desired final overall look, there are three basic approaches to selecting the grout color: matching, contrasting, and neutral. Grout will affect the productÃ¢\x80\x99s final appearance. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Grout tile with sanded grout. Premixed epoxy grout is NOT recommended due to its viscosity. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Allow the entire tiled area to dry completely. Depending on environmental climate, it will typically take 24 hours to dry. Ã¢\x80Â¢ After the installation has been completed, seal the entire area once again with a penetrating sealer. Ã¢\x80Â¢ Note: Always test a small sample tile with the solutions that might be used during installation before applying to an entire area. This guide is intended to provide information on frequently asked questions. Opinions vary in the ceramic tile industry about the proper installation of ceramic tiles. However, since Tierra y Fuego tiles are porous they should be sealed with a penetrating sealer before and after grouting.', 'Clean with mild cleanser and damp cloth, do not use abrasive cleaners.', 'Industry standard recommends adding on 5-10% additional tile to the tile needed to account for waste, special cuts, or other unforeseen problems. This is particularly important in complex installations. Specially with diagonal patterns.']]",Terra Nova Hacienda - Surface Bullnose: Sunflower Yellow,,http://www.tierrayfuego.com/ceramic-tile-terra-nova-hacienda-4x4-bullnose-sunfloweryellow.html,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,5,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00284-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,764221988,764206347,HORIZONTAL,,{54921=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2000 - Tierra y Fuego Inc.

I've been in Thailand a month now and I'm planing a trip around Christmas and NYE because my mother and sister are flying to see me then and they would love visit the islands of Southern Thailand. I really need help 'cause this is my first time in Thailand and I would like to make the trip as comfortable as possible for my loved ones... So I was planning that we would first fly from BKK to Ko Samui at Sat 26. Dec and spend there couple days. What are the main beaches of Ko Samui? I noticed that the airport is located on the Northern part of the island. From Ko Samui we would continue to Phuket or Krabi (which one do you prefer - it's NYE then) by ferries and train/bus. Which are the best options in this route and how long does it last to get there? Okay, and the last destination would be Ko Phi Phi . I assume that we could get there by ferry from Phuket or Krabi? I read somewhere that especially in Ko Phi Phi the accommodations are quite full during the high season, so would it be wise to book a hostel/hotel in advance? And if so, what are the main beaches of the island and does anyone have recommendations of accommodations there? And finally on Wed 6. Jan we would fly back to Bangkok from Phuket. And now I'm more than welcome for any tips concerning the trip (flight, trains, busses, accommodations, beaches, prices, everything). I really need your help because I have limited amount of information so far. I'n extremely grateful if someone has the energy to answer all my questions :), 7931=#1 Posted: 23/11/2009 - 22:06, 5393=#2 Posted: 24/11/2009 - 07:42}",,"best price guarantee Hotel Deals of the Day You need to be logged in to answer an existing post on the Travelfish forums.

I have to say that since I became a manager I can certainly feel what Rodimus was going through with his ""burden hardest to bear."" Despite what a lot of people think, leadership isn't easy, and especially in Rodimus's case where he was replacing such a seasoned and experienced leader as Optimus it must be particularly difficult. Other than that, though,Ã‚Â this was an okay episode. It is never really made clear why Scourge was able to use the Matrix when apparently no other Decepticon could, although it's possible the Matrix simply wanted to teach Rodimus a lesson. Plus it's always bothered me that Rodimus converted back to Hot Rod whenever separated from the Matrix, something Optimus never had to deal with. I couldn't help but think that perhaps they simply should have built him into a more powerful Transformers as they did with Orion Pax, so that this wouldn't keep happening.","Scatman Crothers Jazz Susan Blu Arcee / Marissa Faireborn Jim Cummings Afterburner, Rippersnapper (uncredited) See All Cast & Crew Cast & Crew: RECURRING AND GUESTS EDIT Paul Eiding Perceptor Recurring Role Gregg Berger Grimlock / Long Haul / Outback / Skyfire Recurring Role Christopher Collins Starscream /",True,0,0,

Em 1596, em sua obra Mysterium Cosmographicum, Kepler estabeleceu um modelo do sistema solar onde os cinco sÃƒÂ³lidos platÃƒÂ´nicos eram colocados um dentro do outro, separados por uma sÃƒÂ©rie de esferas inscritas, na seguinte ordem: primeiro o octaedro seguindo-se o icosaedro, o dodecaedro, o tetraedro e, finalmente, o cubo. Ele conjecturou que as razÃƒÂµes entre os raios das ÃƒÂ³rbitas dos planetas coincidiam com as razÃƒÂµes entre os raios das esferas. Seu modelo, contudo, nÃƒÂ£o era sustentado pelos dados experimentais dos astrÃƒÂ´nomos Tycho Brahe (dinamarquÃƒÂªs, 1546-1601) e Nicolau CopÃƒÂ©rnico (polonÃƒÂªs, 1473-1543)., 25749=Os gregos antigos estudaram os sÃƒÂ³lidos platÃƒÂ´nicos exaustivamente. Algumas fontes, como Proclo (410-485), atribuem a descoberta destes sÃƒÂ³lidos a PitÃƒÂ¡goras (572 a.C.-497 a.C.). Outras evidÃƒÂªncias, contudo, sugerem que PitÃƒÂ¡goras conhecia apenas o tetraedro, o cubo e o dodecaedro, enquanto que a descoberta do octaedro e do icosaedro ÃƒÂ© atribuÃƒÂ­da a Teeteto (417 a.C.-369 a.C.), que tambÃƒÂ©m conduziu um estudo mais aprofundado dos cinco sÃƒÂ³lidos regulares, incluindo a primeira demonstraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o conhecida de que existem somente cinco destes sÃƒÂ³lidos. Os nomes sÃƒÂ³lidos platÃƒÂ´nicos ou corpos cÃƒÂ³smicos foram dados devido a forma pela qual PlatÃƒÂ£o (427 a.C.-34 a.C.), em um diÃƒÂ¡logo intitulado Timeu, os empregou para explicar a natureza. NÃƒÂ£o se sabe se Timeu realmente existiu ou se PlatÃƒÂ£o o inventou como um personagem para desenvolver suas idÃƒÂ©ias. Em Timeu, PlatÃƒÂ£o associa cada um dos elementos clÃƒÂ¡ssicos (terra, ar, ÃƒÂ¡gua e fogo) com um poliedro regular. Terra ÃƒÂ© associada com o cubo, ar com o octaedro, ÃƒÂ¡gua com o icosaedro e fogo com o tetraedro. Com relaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o ao quinto sÃƒÂ³lido platÃƒÂ´nico, o dodecaedro, PlatÃƒÂ£o escreve: Ã¢Â€ÂœFaltava ainda uma quinta construÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o que o deus utilizou para organizar todas as constelaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes do cÃƒÂ©u.Ã¢Â€?. AristÃƒÂ³teles introduziu um quinto elemento, ÃƒÂ©ter, e postulou que os cÃƒÂ©us eram feitos deste elemento, mas ele nÃƒÂ£o teve interesse em associÃƒÂ¡-lo com o quinto sÃƒÂ³lido de PlatÃƒÂ£o. Euclides deu uma descriÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o matemÃƒÂ¡tica completa dos sÃƒÂ³lidos platÃƒÂ´nicos no ÃƒÂºltimo livro (Livro XIII) de Os Elementos. As proposiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes de 13 a 17 no Livro XIII descrevem as construÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes do tetraedro, do octaedro, do cubo, do icosaedro, e do dodecaedro, nesta ordem. Para cada sÃƒÂ³lido, Euclides calcula a razÃƒÂ£o entre o diÃƒÂ¢metro da esfera circunscrita e o comprimento da aresta do sÃƒÂ³lido. Na proposiÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o 18, ele demonstra que nÃƒÂ£o existem outros poliedros regulares. Muita da informaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o no Livro XIII ÃƒÂ© provavelmente obtida do trabalho de Teeteto. No sÃƒÂ©culo XVI, o astrÃƒÂ´nomo alemÃƒÂ£o Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) tentou encontrar uma relaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o entre os cinco sÃƒÂ³lidos e os seis planetas que eram conhecidos na ÃƒÂ©poca: MercÃƒÂºrio, VÃƒÂªnus, Terra, Marte, JÃƒÂºpiter e Saturno., 28525=Figura 8: Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)., 34009=Em 1904 o biÃƒÂ³logo alemÃƒÂ£o chamado Ernst Haeckel escreveu a obra Kunstformen der Natur descrevendo os radiolÃƒÂ¡rios, Figura 13, um tipo de protozoÃƒÂ¡rio ameboide que podem assumir formas de poliedros regulares.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 67526=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 20498=VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY - Analyst Report) reported fiscal third quarter 2013 earnings of 15 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Earnings (including stock-based compensation) however plunged 77.3% year over year and 58.3% sequentially. Excluding stock-based compensation, amortization charges and acquisition-related charges VeriFone reported earnings of 24 cents, slightly better than managementÃ¢Â€Â™s forecast of 20 cents. Revenues Revenues (excluding amortization of step-down in deferred revenues at acquisition) decreased 15.3% from the year-ago quarter and 2.9% sequentially to $417.5 million. This was however better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $411.0 million. System Solutions revenues (60.1% of revenues) decreased 28.5% year over year and 10.2% quarter over quarter to $250.8 million. Services revenues (39.9% of revenues) increased 17.1% from the year-ago quarter and 10.7% sequentially to $166.7 million in the quarter. Revenues in North America (which comprises operations in the US and Canada) declined 16.3% year over year and 5.2% sequentially to $115.8 million. The weak result was primarily due to negative impact from higher MX 900 systems volume in the year-ago quarter. Revenues in LAC (which comprises operations in South America, Central America, including Mexico, and the Caribbean) decreased 26.0% year over year and 18.1% quarter over quarter to $69.9 million. Revenues in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) declined 12.0% from the year-ago quarter but increased 3.6% sequentially at $179.0 million. ASPAC revenues (which comprises of operations in Asia Pacific, including China, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the region) declined 7.4% year over year but increased 6.2% sequentially to $52.8 million. Margins Gross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 470 basis points (Ã¢Â€ÂœbpsÃ¢Â€?) from the year-ago quarter and 150 bps from the previous quarter to 40.6%. The year-over-year decline was due to 670 bps contraction in System solution gross margin. The decline was primarily attributed to unfavorable regional and product mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales jumped 740 bps from the year-ago quarter and 350 bps on a sequential basis to 32.5%. This sharp rise in operating expenses was due to higher research & development expense (Ã¢Â€ÂœR&DÃ¢Â€?), which as a percentage of revenues increased 340 bps from the year-ago quarter and 140 bps from the previous quarter to 11.0%. Sales and marketing (Ã¢Â€ÂœS&MÃ¢Â€?) as a percentage of revenues jumped 230 bps year over year and 80 bps quarter over quarter to 11.5%. General & administrative (Ã¢Â€ÂœG&AÃ¢Â€?) was up 170 bps from the year-ago quarter and 120 bps from the previous quarter to 9.9%. Operating margin plunged to 8.1% from 20.2% reported in the year-ago quarter and 500 bps sequentially. The significant decline was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower gross margin base. Ã‚Â  Net income margin plunged to 6.3% from 16.8% reported in the year-ago quarter and 10.9% in the previous quarter. Liquidity At quarter end, VeriFone had approximately $309.3 million in cash compared with $506.0 million in the previous quarter. Total debt was $1.12 billion compared with $1.28 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $49.0 million and free cash flow was $30.9 million in the quarter. Outlook VeriFone expects non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of $418.0-$422.0 million for fiscal fourth quarter 2013. Management expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings to be approximately 25 cents. Free cash flow is expected to be $25.0 million. Recommendation VeriFone reported better-than-expected third quarter results but provided a cautious outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2013. We believe that VeriFoneÃ¢Â€Â™s innovative product pipeline and strong partnerships with leading retailers Costco (COST - Analyst Report) and McDonaldÃ¢Â€Â™s (MCD - Analyst Report) will boost top-line growth going forward. Moreover, VeriFoneÃ¢Â€Â™s additional spending on research & development and technical sales personnel will drive sales volume going forward. However, this additional spending will continue to keep margins under pressure in the near term. Additionally, competition continues to be stiff from the likes of NCR Corp. (NCR - Analyst Report), and is a major headwind. Organic growth also remains a matter of concern amid volatile macro economic conditions. Further, we believe that the rebuilding of the Middle East and African distribution channel will take some time and remain a headwind for top-line growth in the near term. Currently, VeriFone has a Zacks Rank #2 (Hold)., 14862=by Zacks Equity Research Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Published on September 09, 2013 |}","Income Momentum Value Growth Zacks #1 Rank Top Movers for Jul 27, 2015 Zacks #1 Rank Top Movers Zacks #1 Rank Top Movers for 07/27/15 } } document.getElementById('score_val').className = ''; document.getElementById('score_val').innerHTML = ''; document.getElementById('tab_label').innerHTML = tab_text; { else } document.getElementById('score_val').className = 'scores_val'; document.getElementById('score_val').innerHTML = 'A'; document.getElementById('tab_label').innerHTML = tab_text+ ' Score'; { if(tab_text != 'income') document.getElementById('rank_text').innerHTML = cat_uri; var cat_uri = 'View All Zacks Rank #1 '+tab_text+' Stocks'; var cat_uri = '/stocks/buy-list/'+tab_text; { function footer_text(tab_text)",Company Symbol Price %Chg TESSCO TECHÃ¢Â€Â¦ TESS 23.42 +2.90% ITT EDUCATIÃ¢Â€Â¦ ESI 4.90 +2.73% GUESS?

Earnings (including stock-based compensation) however plunged 77.3% year over year and 58.3% sequentially. Excluding stock-based compensation, amortization charges and acquisition-related charges VeriFone reported earnings of 24 cents, slightly better than managementÃ¢Â€Â™s forecast of 20 cents. Revenues Revenues (excluding amortization of step-down in deferred revenues at acquisition) decreased 15.3% from the year-ago quarter and 2.9% sequentially to $417.5 million. This was however better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $411.0 million.

Services revenues (39.9% of revenues) increased 17.1% from the year-ago quarter and 10.7% sequentially to $166.7 million in the quarter. Revenues in North America (which comprises operations in the US and Canada) declined 16.3% year over year and 5.2% sequentially to $115.8 million. The weak result was primarily due to negative impact from higher MX 900 systems volume in the year-ago quarter. Revenues in LAC (which comprises operations in South America, Central America, including Mexico, and the Caribbean) decreased 26.0% year over year and 18.1% quarter over quarter to $69.9 million.

ASPAC revenues (which comprises of operations in Asia Pacific, including China, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the region) declined 7.4% year over year but increased 6.2% sequentially to $52.8 million. Margins Gross margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 470 basis points (Ã¢Â€ÂœbpsÃ¢Â€?) from the year-ago quarter and 150 bps from the previous quarter to 40.6%. The year-over-year decline was due to 670 bps contraction in System solution gross margin. The decline was primarily attributed to unfavorable regional and product mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales jumped 740 bps from the year-ago quarter and 350 bps on a sequential basis to 32.5%. This sharp rise in operating expenses was due to higher research & development expense (Ã¢Â€ÂœR&DÃ¢Â€?), which as a percentage of revenues increased 340 bps from the year-ago quarter and 140 bps from the previous quarter to 11.0%. Sales and marketing (Ã¢Â€ÂœS&MÃ¢Â€?) as a percentage of revenues jumped 230 bps year over year and 80 bps quarter over quarter to 11.5%. General & administrative (Ã¢Â€ÂœG&AÃ¢Â€?) was up 170 bps from the year-ago quarter and 120 bps from the previous quarter to 9.9%. Operating margin plunged to 8.1% from 20.2% reported in the year-ago quarter and 500 bps sequentially. The significant decline was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower gross margin base. Ã‚Â  Net income margin plunged to 6.3% from 16.8% reported in the year-ago quarter and 10.9% in the previous quarter. Liquidity At quarter end, VeriFone had approximately $309.3 million in cash compared with $506.0 million in the previous quarter. Total debt was $1.12 billion compared with $1.28 billion in the previous quarter. Cash flow from operations was $49.0 million and free cash flow was $30.9 million in the quarter. Outlook VeriFone expects non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of $418.0-$422.0 million for fiscal fourth quarter 2013. Management expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings to be approximately 25 cents. Free cash flow is expected to be $25.0 million. Recommendation VeriFone reported better-than-expected third quarter results but provided a cautious outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2013. We believe that VeriFoneÃ¢Â€Â™s innovative product pipeline and strong partnerships with leading retailers Costco (COST - Analyst Report) and McDonaldÃ¢Â€Â™s (MCD - Analyst Report) will boost top-line growth going forward. Moreover, VeriFoneÃ¢Â€Â™s additional spending on research & development and technical sales personnel will drive sales volume going forward. However, this additional spending will continue to keep margins under pressure in the near term. Additionally, competition continues to be stiff from the likes of NCR Corp.

Current options for the treatment of oxidative stress in diabetic nephropathy are limited and only partially effective, thus interest in the development of new strategies is high. The study intends to test the hypothesis that combined oral supplementation of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and milk thistle flavonolignan silibin (as silibin-phosphatidylcholine) will reduce proteinuria and urinary and systemic manifestations of oxidative stress and inflammation, which are characteristically observed in patients with T2DM and related nephropathy. We expect these effects to be achieved with minimal or no side effects, and with good patient tolerance. The trial is designed as a two-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, modified-factorial dose-ranging design, five-arm pilot study in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria. Intervention consists of three-month oral administration of NAC, silibin, and/or respective placebos for three months. Subjects are randomized to the following five intervention arms: (A) placebo; (B) NAC; (C) silibin; (D) NAC + silibin; and (E) NAC + double-dose silibin. The primary outcome measure is urinary excretion of albumin, a marker of glomerular injury. Secondary outcome measures are alpha-1 microglobulin, a marker of tubular injury, and urinary excretion of inflammatory cytokines and C-C chemokines, i.e. markers of renal inflammation.

""Senses Working Overtime"" (originally a single by XTC released in 1982) was released in March 2004 as the official second single in the States, but failed to make a large impact. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 315,000 copies in the United States;[18] this figure was considered disappointing and after the release of a greatest hits album, Moore parted ways with Epic Records., 9061=The opening track, ""Senses Working Overtime"" is a cover of the English band XTC, released in 1982 and written by Andy Partridge. ""The Whole of the Moon"" is a cover of the band The Waterboys, originally released in 1985. The subject of the lyrics has inspired speculation, some of which has been rebutted by the writer.[4] ""Can We Still Be Friends"" is a cover of singer Todd Rundgren. The lyrics describe a relationship to which Rundgren and the woman to whom he is singing have given great effort, but simply cannot work. Rundgren explains this, but wishes to part amicably, asking several times if he and his partner can ""still be friends"". The song is generally assumed to be about Rundgren's breakup with long-time companion Bebe Buell in 1977.[5] ""I Feel the Earth Move"" is a song written and recorded by pop singer-songwriter Carole King.[6] ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" is a 1972 song from the Elton John album Honky ChÃƒÂ¢teau. It was written by Bernie Taupin and is his take on New York City after hearing a gun go off near his hotel window during his first visit to the city.[7][8] ""Drop the Pilot"" is a song written and originally performed by Joan Armatrading. It was the first single to be released from Armatrading's 1983 album The Key. ""Moonshadow"" is a song from the album Teaser and the Firecat, released by Cat Stevens in 1971. ""One Way or Another"" is a song by American new wave band Blondie. Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album, Parallel Lines (1978), the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break-up.[9] The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to ""Heart of Glass"". ""One Way or Another"" reached #24 in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[10] ""Breaking Us in Two"" is a cover of singer Joe Jackson, while ""Anticipation"" is a song by Carly Simon. It was the most famous track from her 1971 album of the same name. The song was used in commercials for Heinz Ketchup through the late 1970s into the 1980s.[11] ""Help Me"" is a love song written, produced and performed by Joni Mitchell, from her 1974 album Court and Spark. The song was recorded with jazz band Tom Scott's L.A.

On the red carpet of the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed that her fourth studio album consisted of songs from the '70s and '80s., 4440=Coverage is the fourth studio album by American pop singer Mandy Moore.

Los sentimientos son el resultado de las emociones y pueden ser verbalizadas (palabras). FisiolÃƒÂ³gicamente, las emociones organizan rÃƒÂ¡pidamente las respuestas de distintos sistemas biolÃƒÂ³gicos, incluidas las expresiones faciales, los mÃƒÂºsculos, la voz, la actividad del SNA y la del sistema endocrino, a fin de establecer un medio interno ÃƒÂ³ptimo para el comportamiento mÃƒÂ¡s efectivo. Los diversos estados emocionales son causados por la liberaciÃƒÂ³n de neurotransmisor (o neuromediador) y hormonas, que luego convierten estas emociones en sentimientos y finalmente en el lenguaje. Conductualmente, las emociones sirven para establecer nuestra posiciÃƒÂ³n con respecto a nuestro entorno, y nos impulsan hacia ciertas personas, objetos, acciones, ideas y nos alejan de otros. Las emociones actÃƒÂºan tambiÃƒÂ©n como depÃƒÂ³sito de influencias innatas y aprendidas, y poseen ciertas caracterÃƒÂ­sticas invariables y otras que muestran cierta variaciÃƒÂ³n entre individuos, grupos y culturas (Levenson, 1994).[1]}","{28738=Los resultados de un metaanÃƒÂ¡lisis sugieren que las emociones negativas y positivas pueden ser diferenciadas en el sistema nerviosos autÃƒÂ³nomo, pero no necesariamente emociones especÃƒÂ­ficas (Cacioppo et al., 2000, en Friedman, 2010).

Paluun kilpailukalenteriin teki Yhdysvaltain Grand Prix, joka ajettiin uudella radalla Austinissa, Texasissa.[1] Kaudella 2012 kilpailtiin myÃƒÂ¶s Bahrainissa vuoden tauon jÃƒÂ¤lkeen.[2], 137600=Abu Dhabin Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t olivat alunperin suunnitelleet muutoksia Yas Marina Circuit -rataan rankasti kritisoidun kauden 2010 osakilpailun jÃƒÂ¤lkeen.[148] Kritiikin mukaan ohittamiset radalla olivat aivan liian vÃƒÂ¤hÃƒÂ¤isiÃƒÂ¤.[148] MyÃƒÂ¶hemmin hanketta kuitenkin lykÃƒÂ¤ttiin kaudelle 2011 tulleiden sÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶muutosten myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤.[149] Korean Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t puolestaan ilmaisivat tyytymÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¶myytensÃƒÂ¤ nykyiseen sopimukseen Bernie Ecclestonen ja Formula One Managementin kanssa.[150] JÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t olivat erityisen tyytymÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¶miÃƒÂ¤ suuriin kuluihin ja vaativat sopimuksen uudelleen neuvottelua paremmilla ehdoilla.[150][151] Ecclestonen mukaan jo nykyisen sopimuksen neuvottelu oli riittÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤n hankalaa ja hÃƒÂ¤nen mukaansa jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t ovat olleet tietoisia sopimuksen ehdoista allekirjoittaessaan sen.[152] Ecclestone totesi, ettÃƒÂ¤ siinÃƒÂ¤ tapauksessa mikÃƒÂ¤li jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t eivÃƒÂ¤t kykene suoriutumaan kuluistaan, koko kilpailu poistettaisiin kalenterista.[152] Lopullisessa kilpailukalenterissa Korean osakilpailu on kuitenkin entisellÃƒÂ¤ paikallaan ja kilpailu tullaan ajamaan normaalisti., 104481=Kaudella 2012 ajettiin yhteensÃƒÂ¤ 20 osakilpailua. Avauskilpailu ajettiin Melbournessa, Australiassa ja pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤tÃƒÂ¶skilpailu Interlagosissa, Brasiliassa. KesÃƒÂ¤kuussa 2011 kalenteriin oli kaavailtu ennÃƒÂ¤tyksellistÃƒÂ¤ 21 kilpailua.[118][119] MyÃƒÂ¶hemmin FIA:n puheenjohtaja Jean Todt totesi, ettÃƒÂ¤ 20 kilpailua on ylÃƒÂ¤raja, muttei suostunut kommentoimaan mikÃƒÂ¤ kilpailu tultaisiin jÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n pois kalenterista.[120] HeinÃƒÂ¤kuussa julkaistiin pÃƒÂ¤ivitetty kalenteri, josta Turkin osakilpailu oli jÃƒÂ¤tetty pois.[121] Kilpailukalenteri vahvistettiin 7. joulukuuta 2011.[122], 22158=EdellisellÃƒÂ¤ kaudella kuljettajien maailmanmestari Sebastian Vettel ja valmistajien maailmanmestari Red Bull dominoivat kautta. Red Bullin vauhdissa pysyivÃƒÂ¤t mukana vain McLaren ja Ferrari. Alkukaudesta myÃƒÂ¶s Renaultin (nykyisin Lotus) kuljettajat ylsivÃƒÂ¤t palkintopallille kahdesti. Muut pistesijat jakautuivat pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤asiassa Mercedes Grand Prix'n, Force Indian, Sauberin ja Toro Rosson kuljettajien kesken. PerÃƒÂ¤npitÃƒÂ¤jiksi jÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤t viisi pistettÃƒÂ¤ saavuttanut Williams sekÃƒÂ¤ pisteittÃƒÂ¤ jÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤neet Lotus (nykyisin Caterham), HRT ja Virgin Racing (nykyisin Marussia). Kuljettajien mestaruus ratkesi Vettelille lopulta 122 pisteen erolla Jenson Buttoniin. Vettelin tallitoveri Mark Webber sijoittui mestaruustaistossa kolmanneksi. NeljÃƒÂ¤nnen sijan saavutti Fernando Alonso ja viidennen sijan Lewis Hamilton. Valmistajien mestaruus ratkesi Red Bullin eduksi Korean Grand Prix'ssa. Lopullisissa pisteissÃƒÂ¤ eroa toiseksi sijoittuneeseen McLareniin tuli 153 pistettÃƒÂ¤. Kolmas sija meni Ferrarille ja neljÃƒÂ¤s sija Mercedes Grand Prix'lle., 28561=Kaudelle 2012 sÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶ihin tehtiin myÃƒÂ¶s muutos, joka kieltÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ pakokaasuvirtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤misen diffuusorissa.[18] SÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶muutoksen tavoitteena on tehdÃƒÂ¤ pienemmillÃƒÂ¤ ja rajallisimmilla resursseilla toimivista talleista kilpailukykyisempiÃƒÂ¤.[19] Red Bullin teknisen johtajan Adrian Neweyn mukaan talli saavutti juuri tÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n ratkaisun avulla viime kaudella etulyÃƒÂ¶ntiaseman.[18] KansainvÃƒÂ¤linen autoliitto FIA esitti helmikuun lopussa Renault- ja Mercedes-moottoreita kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤ville talleille vaatimuksen muuttaa moottorikarttojaan niin, ettÃƒÂ¤ kuljettajat eivÃƒÂ¤t saa hyÃƒÂ¶tyÃƒÂ¤ pakokaasuvirtauksesta.[20][21] Molemmat moottorit tuottavat edelleen pakokaasuvirtauksia myÃƒÂ¶s silloin kun kuljettaja ei paina kaasua.[20] NÃƒÂ¤iden virtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤minen downforcen ja pidon kasvattamisessa kiellettiin.[20] Kiellosta huolimatta jotkut tallit kehittivÃƒÂ¤t vaihtoehtoisia ratkaisuja diffuusorille hyÃƒÂ¶tyÃƒÂ¤kseen virtauksista.[22] Esimerkiksi Mercedes Grand Prix muotoili autonsa takaosan niin, ettÃƒÂ¤ ilma- ja pakokaasuvirtaukset ohjautuvat diffuusorin pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤lle rakennettuun kanavaan moottorinkatteen aukkojen avulla.[23] LisÃƒÂ¤ksi talli kehitti niin kutsutun F-putkijÃƒÂ¤rjestelmÃƒÂ¤n, jossa auton rakenteeseen upotetut putket saivat takasiiven avauksen yhteydessÃƒÂ¤ myÃƒÂ¶s etusiiven sakkaamaan kasvattaen huomattavasti suoranopeutta.[24] Kilpakumppanit protestoivat useasti Mercedeksen ratkaisusta, mutta FIA:n katsastuksissa rakennelman todettiin olevan sÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶jen sallimissa puitteissa.[24] MyÃƒÂ¶s Red Bull kehitti oman ratkaisunsa pakokaasuvirtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤miseksi.[25] Talli toi ratkaisun vasta kolmanteen testijaksoon salatakseen innovaation kilpailijoilta.[25], 101561=Alonso sai lÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶n jÃƒÂ¤lkeen pidettyÃƒÂ¤ kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikkansa. Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa ja Bruno Senna rikkoivat etusiipensÃƒÂ¤ avauskierroksella. ViidennellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Lotuksen Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen kÃƒÂ¤vi huiman kamppailun Force Indian Paul di Restan kanssa kahdeksannesta sijasta. Kuljettajat ajoivat rengas rengasta vasten usean mutkan ajan. Taistelu pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ttyi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶sen eduksi. McLarenin Lewis Hamilton putosi kierroksen pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤hÃƒÂ¤n kÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤ rengasrikon takia. Kierroksella 35 Hamilton herÃƒÂ¤tti kummastusta ohitettuaan kilpailussa toisena olleen Vettelin, vaikka oli tÃƒÂ¤tÃƒÂ¤ kierroksen jÃƒÂ¤ljessÃƒÂ¤. Hamiltonin tallikaveri Jenson Button sai VetteliÃƒÂ¤ kiinni ja pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤si ohi toisten varikkopysÃƒÂ¤hdyksien aikana. Vettel ja Button kÃƒÂ¤vivÃƒÂ¤t kilpailun lopussa kovaa kamppailua kakkospaikasta. ViimeistÃƒÂ¤ edellisellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Vettel ajautui radan ulkopuolelle ohittaessaan Buttonia. Vettel sai tilanteesta tuomaristolta 20 sekunnin aikarangaistuksen. Alonso ajoi maaliin voittajana, Vettel tuli maaliin toisena ja Button kolmantena. Vettelin aikarangaistuksen myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤ Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen nousi neljÃƒÂ¤nneltÃƒÂ¤ sijalta kolmanneksi., 93909=Vettel piti kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikkansa lÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶ssÃƒÂ¤. Paalupaikalta lÃƒÂ¤htenyt Vettel johti kilpailua yli 20 sekunnilla, kunnes 29. kierroksella Jean-Eric Vergnen ja Heikki Kovalaisen kolaroinnin takia radalle tullut turva-auto vei etumatkan. Vettel piti kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikan vielÃƒÂ¤ turva-auton jÃƒÂ¤lkeisessÃƒÂ¤ uusintalÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶ssÃƒÂ¤, mutta sitten auton vauhti hiipui ja saksalainen joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n. Keskeytyksen syynÃƒÂ¤ oli moottorin ylikuumentunut laturi. Viisi kierrosta myÃƒÂ¶hemmin myÃƒÂ¶s kilpailua johtanut Romain Grosjean joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n laturivian vuoksi. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤ Fernando Alonso nousi kisan kÃƒÂ¤rkeen. Kaksi kierrosta ennen maalia Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen onnistui ohittamaan kilpailussa toisena olleen Lewis Hamiltonin. ViimeisellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Pastor Maldonado yritti samaa, mutta kolaroi Hamiltonin kylkeen. Hamilton joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n ja Maldonadolta irtosi etusiipi. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n ansiosta Michael Schumacher ajoi Alonson ja RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶sen jÃƒÂ¤lkeen kolmanneksi, ottaen ainoan palkintosijan paluunsa jÃƒÂ¤lkeen., 45624=Kauden ensimmÃƒÂ¤inen varsinainen testijakso jÃƒÂ¤rjestettiin Jerezin radalla Espanjassa 7.-10. helmikuuta. Testeihin osallistuivat kaikki muut tallit Marussiaa lukuunottamatta, sillÃƒÂ¤ talli ei ehtinyt saamaan autoansa valmiiksi.[52][53] Mercedes Grand Prix ja HRT F1 osallistuivat testiin edellisen vuoden autoillaan.[54] LisÃƒÂ¤ksi Mercedes Grand Prix jÃƒÂ¤tti kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤ viimeisen testipÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n, jotta talli sai testata yksityisesti sunnuntaina 19.2. ennen toista testijaksoa Barcelonassa.[55] EnsimmÃƒÂ¤isenÃƒÂ¤ testipÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤nÃƒÂ¤ kovinta vauhtia piti paluun Formula 1 -sarjaan tekevÃƒÂ¤ Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen.[56] Paul di Resta ajoi Force Indialla pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n toiseksi nopeimman ajan ja Nico Rosberg Mercedes Grand Prix'n edellisen vuoden autolla pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n kolmanneksi nopeimman ajan.[56], 140030=Tammikuussa 2012 Euroopan Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t olivat yhteydessÃƒÂ¤ Ecclestoneen liittyen kilpailun tulevaisuuteen Valenciassa.[153] JÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t kertoivat kilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤misen olevan taloudellisesti kannattamatonta ja toivoivat sopimuksensa ehtojen uudelleen neuvottelua kulujen karsisimiseksi.[153][154] Espanjan Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t ilmaisivat samankaltaisia huolia liittyen omaan kilpailuunsa.[155] Maaliskuussa espanjalainen lehti El Pais uutisoi ettei Valencian osakilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t ole maksaneet kauden 2012 kisamaksua Ecclestonelle.[156] Lehden mukaan jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤t kÃƒÂ¤yvÃƒÂ¤t edelleen neuvotteluja kilpailun kohtalosta.[156] MyÃƒÂ¶hemmin Ecclestone ilmoitti kaikkien maksujen olevan Valencian osalta kunnossa.[157] Samalla Ecclestone ilmoitti, ettÃƒÂ¤ kaudesta 2013 alkaen Valencia ja Barcelona vuorottelevat Espanjan Grand Prix'n isÃƒÂ¤ntinÃƒÂ¤.[157], 51209=Testit jatkuivat keskiviikkona.

Kilpailu ajetaan kokonaan uudella Hermann Tilken suunnittelemalla radalla Austinissa, Texasissa. Marraskuussa 2011 Formula 1:sen kaupallisia oikeuksia hallinnoiva Bernie Ecclestone ilmaisi epÃƒÂ¤ilynsÃƒÂ¤ kilpailun toteutumista, sillÃƒÂ¤ sopimus kilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤misestÃƒÂ¤ oli edelleen allekirjoittamatta kilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤n ja radan omistajan ajauduttua keskinÃƒÂ¤isiin riitoihin.[143] Jopa radan rakennustyÃƒÂ¶t ehdittiin keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n.[144] Ecclestone antoi kilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jille aikaa 7. pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n joulukuuta asti selvittÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ kilpailun kohtalo.[145] 7. joulukuuta jÃƒÂ¤rjestettiin myÃƒÂ¶s FIA:n maailmanneuvoston kokous, jossa lopullinen kilpailukalenteri vahvistettiin.[122] Kokouksen jÃƒÂ¤lkeen julkistettuun kilpailukalenteriin Yhdysvaltain Grand Prix oli sijoitettu marraskuun 18. pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤lle. Kokouksen jÃƒÂ¤lkeen Ecclestone vahvisti kilpailun taloudellisen puolen olevan kunnossa.[122] Kilpailu oli sijoitettu alustavasti kesÃƒÂ¤kuulle, mutta se siirrettiin myÃƒÂ¶hemmÃƒÂ¤ksi Texasin kuuman kesÃƒÂ¤n vuoksi.[121][146], 8565=Ã‚Â Ã¢Â†?Ã‚Â 2011, 10194=Kauden alkua vÃƒÂ¤rittivÃƒÂ¤t lukuisat osakilpailuvoittajat.

Vasta Euroopan Grand Prix'ssÃƒÂ¤ saatiin toistamiseen kaudella voittanut kuljettaja, kun Ferrarin Fernando Alonso nappasi kauden toisen voittonsa. Voittonsa turvin Alonso nousi kuljettajien mestaruustaistelun kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikalle, jossa hÃƒÂ¤n pysyi seitsemÃƒÂ¤n osakilpailun ajan. Viime vuoden mestari Sebastian Vettel sai Alonson kiinni pisteissÃƒÂ¤ tÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n keskeytettyÃƒÂ¤ Belgiassa ja Japanissa avauskierroksella. Vettel nousi sarjataulukon kÃƒÂ¤rkeen, jossa hÃƒÂ¤n pysyi loppukauden. MyÃƒÂ¶s Vettel kÃƒÂ¤rsi lukuisista vaikeuksista kauden aikana, ja hÃƒÂ¤n joutui muun muassa starttamaan Abu Dhabin kilpailuun varikkosuoralta. Viimeiseen osakilpailuun lÃƒÂ¤hdettÃƒÂ¤essÃƒÂ¤ VettelillÃƒÂ¤ oli 13 pisteen etumatka, joka riitti monivaiheisesta kilpailusta huolimatta niukasti Vettelin kolmanteen perÃƒÂ¤kkÃƒÂ¤iseen maailmanmestaruuteen.

Kolmas sija meni Ferrarille ja neljÃƒÂ¤s sija Mercedes Grand Prix'lle., 28561=Kaudelle 2012 sÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶ihin tehtiin myÃƒÂ¶s muutos, joka kieltÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ pakokaasuvirtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤misen diffuusorissa.[18] SÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶muutoksen tavoitteena on tehdÃƒÂ¤ pienemmillÃƒÂ¤ ja rajallisimmilla resursseilla toimivista talleista kilpailukykyisempiÃƒÂ¤.[19] Red Bullin teknisen johtajan Adrian Neweyn mukaan talli saavutti juuri tÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n ratkaisun avulla viime kaudella etulyÃƒÂ¶ntiaseman.[18] KansainvÃƒÂ¤linen autoliitto FIA esitti helmikuun lopussa Renault- ja Mercedes-moottoreita kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤ville talleille vaatimuksen muuttaa moottorikarttojaan niin, ettÃƒÂ¤ kuljettajat eivÃƒÂ¤t saa hyÃƒÂ¶tyÃƒÂ¤ pakokaasuvirtauksesta.[20][21] Molemmat moottorit tuottavat edelleen pakokaasuvirtauksia myÃƒÂ¶s silloin kun kuljettaja ei paina kaasua.[20] NÃƒÂ¤iden virtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤minen downforcen ja pidon kasvattamisessa kiellettiin.[20] Kiellosta huolimatta jotkut tallit kehittivÃƒÂ¤t vaihtoehtoisia ratkaisuja diffuusorille hyÃƒÂ¶tyÃƒÂ¤kseen virtauksista.[22] Esimerkiksi Mercedes Grand Prix muotoili autonsa takaosan niin, ettÃƒÂ¤ ilma- ja pakokaasuvirtaukset ohjautuvat diffuusorin pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤lle rakennettuun kanavaan moottorinkatteen aukkojen avulla.[23] LisÃƒÂ¤ksi talli kehitti niin kutsutun F-putkijÃƒÂ¤rjestelmÃƒÂ¤n, jossa auton rakenteeseen upotetut putket saivat takasiiven avauksen yhteydessÃƒÂ¤ myÃƒÂ¶s etusiiven sakkaamaan kasvattaen huomattavasti suoranopeutta.[24] Kilpakumppanit protestoivat useasti Mercedeksen ratkaisusta, mutta FIA:n katsastuksissa rakennelman todettiin olevan sÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ntÃƒÂ¶jen sallimissa puitteissa.[24] MyÃƒÂ¶s Red Bull kehitti oman ratkaisunsa pakokaasuvirtausten hyÃƒÂ¶dyntÃƒÂ¤miseksi.[25] Talli toi ratkaisun vasta kolmanteen testijaksoon salatakseen innovaation kilpailijoilta.[25], 101561=Alonso sai lÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶n jÃƒÂ¤lkeen pidettyÃƒÂ¤ kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikkansa. Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa ja Bruno Senna rikkoivat etusiipensÃƒÂ¤ avauskierroksella. ViidennellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Lotuksen Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen kÃƒÂ¤vi huiman kamppailun Force Indian Paul di Restan kanssa kahdeksannesta sijasta. Kuljettajat ajoivat rengas rengasta vasten usean mutkan ajan. Taistelu pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ttyi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶sen eduksi. McLarenin Lewis Hamilton putosi kierroksen pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤hÃƒÂ¤n kÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤ rengasrikon takia. Kierroksella 35 Hamilton herÃƒÂ¤tti kummastusta ohitettuaan kilpailussa toisena olleen Vettelin, vaikka oli tÃƒÂ¤tÃƒÂ¤ kierroksen jÃƒÂ¤ljessÃƒÂ¤. Hamiltonin tallikaveri Jenson Button sai VetteliÃƒÂ¤ kiinni ja pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤si ohi toisten varikkopysÃƒÂ¤hdyksien aikana. Vettel ja Button kÃƒÂ¤vivÃƒÂ¤t kilpailun lopussa kovaa kamppailua kakkospaikasta. ViimeistÃƒÂ¤ edellisellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Vettel ajautui radan ulkopuolelle ohittaessaan Buttonia. Vettel sai tilanteesta tuomaristolta 20 sekunnin aikarangaistuksen. Alonso ajoi maaliin voittajana, Vettel tuli maaliin toisena ja Button kolmantena. Vettelin aikarangaistuksen myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤ Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen nousi neljÃƒÂ¤nneltÃƒÂ¤ sijalta kolmanneksi., 93909=Vettel piti kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikkansa lÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶ssÃƒÂ¤. Paalupaikalta lÃƒÂ¤htenyt Vettel johti kilpailua yli 20 sekunnilla, kunnes 29. kierroksella Jean-Eric Vergnen ja Heikki Kovalaisen kolaroinnin takia radalle tullut turva-auto vei etumatkan. Vettel piti kÃƒÂ¤rkipaikan vielÃƒÂ¤ turva-auton jÃƒÂ¤lkeisessÃƒÂ¤ uusintalÃƒÂ¤hdÃƒÂ¶ssÃƒÂ¤, mutta sitten auton vauhti hiipui ja saksalainen joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n. Keskeytyksen syynÃƒÂ¤ oli moottorin ylikuumentunut laturi. Viisi kierrosta myÃƒÂ¶hemmin myÃƒÂ¶s kilpailua johtanut Romain Grosjean joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n laturivian vuoksi. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤ Fernando Alonso nousi kisan kÃƒÂ¤rkeen. Kaksi kierrosta ennen maalia Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen onnistui ohittamaan kilpailussa toisena olleen Lewis Hamiltonin. ViimeisellÃƒÂ¤ kierroksella Pastor Maldonado yritti samaa, mutta kolaroi Hamiltonin kylkeen. Hamilton joutui keskeyttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n ja Maldonadolta irtosi etusiipi. TÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤n ansiosta Michael Schumacher ajoi Alonson ja RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶sen jÃƒÂ¤lkeen kolmanneksi, ottaen ainoan palkintosijan paluunsa jÃƒÂ¤lkeen., 45624=Kauden ensimmÃƒÂ¤inen varsinainen testijakso jÃƒÂ¤rjestettiin Jerezin radalla Espanjassa 7.-10. helmikuuta. Testeihin osallistuivat kaikki muut tallit Marussiaa lukuunottamatta, sillÃƒÂ¤ talli ei ehtinyt saamaan autoansa valmiiksi.[52][53] Mercedes Grand Prix ja HRT F1 osallistuivat testiin edellisen vuoden autoillaan.[54] LisÃƒÂ¤ksi Mercedes Grand Prix jÃƒÂ¤tti kÃƒÂ¤yttÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¤ttÃƒÂ¤ viimeisen testipÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n, jotta talli sai testata yksityisesti sunnuntaina 19.2. ennen toista testijaksoa Barcelonassa.[55] EnsimmÃƒÂ¤isenÃƒÂ¤ testipÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤nÃƒÂ¤ kovinta vauhtia piti paluun Formula 1 -sarjaan tekevÃƒÂ¤ Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen.[56] Paul di Resta ajoi Force Indialla pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n toiseksi nopeimman ajan ja Nico Rosberg Mercedes Grand Prix'n edellisen vuoden autolla pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤n kolmanneksi nopeimman ajan.[56], 140030=Tammikuussa 2012 Euroopan Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t olivat yhteydessÃƒÂ¤ Ecclestoneen liittyen kilpailun tulevaisuuteen Valenciassa.[153] JÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t kertoivat kilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤misen olevan taloudellisesti kannattamatonta ja toivoivat sopimuksensa ehtojen uudelleen neuvottelua kulujen karsisimiseksi.[153][154] Espanjan Grand Prix'n jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t ilmaisivat samankaltaisia huolia liittyen omaan kilpailuunsa.[155] Maaliskuussa espanjalainen lehti El Pais uutisoi ettei Valencian osakilpailun jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤jÃƒÂ¤t ole maksaneet kauden 2012 kisamaksua Ecclestonelle.[156] Lehden mukaan jÃƒÂ¤rjestÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤t kÃƒÂ¤yvÃƒÂ¤t edelleen neuvotteluja kilpailun kohtalosta.[156] MyÃƒÂ¶hemmin Ecclestone ilmoitti kaikkien maksujen olevan Valencian osalta kunnossa.[157] Samalla Ecclestone ilmoitti, ettÃƒÂ¤ kaudesta 2013 alkaen Valencia ja Barcelona vuorottelevat Espanjan Grand Prix'n isÃƒÂ¤ntinÃƒÂ¤.[157], 51209=Testit jatkuivat keskiviikkona.

Sauberia ajanut PÃƒÂ©rez ajoi parhaan kierroksen.[79] Toiselle sijalle ylsi Button ja kolmannelle Daniel Ricciardo Toro Rossolla.[79] Lotus testasi autoaan ainoastaan aamupÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤llÃƒÂ¤, sillÃƒÂ¤ talli ei ollut varautunut sadesÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤hÃƒÂ¤n.[80] HRT puolestaan ilmoitti, ettei se saavu lainkaan viimeiseen testiin, sillÃƒÂ¤ tallin uutta autoa ei ehditty valmistella testiÃƒÂ¤ varten.[81] Red Bull toi lauantaina radalle pÃƒÂ¤ivitetyn version autostaan.[82] Auton aerodynaamisia ominaisuuksia oli hiottu paremmiksi.[82] Testin viimeisenÃƒÂ¤ pÃƒÂ¤ivÃƒÂ¤nÃƒÂ¤ Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen kellotti parhaan ajan Lotuksella.[45] Fernando Alonson veto riitti toiseen sijaan ja Williamsia testanneen Bruno Sennan kolmanteen sijaan.[45], 12059=Kauden 2012 aikana rikottiin muitakin ennÃƒÂ¤tyksiÃƒÂ¤. Paluun tehneen Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶sen myÃƒÂ¶tÃƒÂ¤ lÃƒÂ¤htÃƒÂ¶ruudukossa oli ennÃƒÂ¤tyksellisesti kuusi kuljettajien mestaruuden voittanutta kuljettajaa - Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button, Kimi RÃƒÂ¤ikkÃƒÂ¶nen, Lewis Hamilton ja Michael Schumacher, joka pÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤tti uransa kauden viimeisen osakilpailun yhteydessÃƒÂ¤. 20 kilpailun mittainen kalenteri oli myÃƒÂ¶s ennÃƒÂ¤tyspitkÃƒÂ¤ - aiempi ennÃƒÂ¤tys oli 19 osakilpailua. Kausi 2012 oli ensimmÃƒÂ¤inen sitten kauden 1969, jolloin F1-sarjassa ei kilpaillut yhtÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤n italialaiskuljettajaa, kun Jarno Trulli sai potkut Caterham-tallista ennen kauden alkua.

It is Bertrand Nadel's contribution to the Spotted Peccary quest for new Native American music. This is a family affair, as are most SPM discs. Howard Givens, Deborah Martin, and Jon Jenkins are guest performers. (They are also SPM performers and partners.) This soundscape is rich and powerful. The sound design gives equal access to all of Nadel's elements. That gives the project a contemporary feel with echoes of the influences. It is all done well. There are no major flaws. It is a good disc and it is unique in many ways. It is similar, in emotional response, to the music of Kitaro and Steven Halpern. Top Albums and Songs by Bertrand Nadel 1.

In de jaren negentig zijn er veel minder grote betogingen geweest. In de jaren 2000 kwam betogen weer helemaal in, door onder meer andersglobalistische betogingen en betogingen tegen de oorlog in Irak., 9842=Niet-democratische landen verbieden zelfs demonstraties in het geheel, treden hier hard tegen op, en gebruiken het ordehandhavingsargument als argument hiervoor. Een voorbeeld is het neerslaan van de studentendemonstratie in 1989 door het Chinese leger. Vaak vinden arrestaties plaats en worden dissidenten opgesloten, gemarteld of berecht in showprocessen. Dit kan echter ook averechts werken wanneer het harde beleid van de overheid nou juist de afkeer hiertegen versterkt, waardoor de situatie escaleert naar een burgeroorlog. Dit was het geval bij de aanloop naar de Libische Opstand van 2011.}","{19454=De Maandagdemonstraties in 1989 en 1990 waren wekelijkse demonstraties, die aanvankelijk in de Nikolaikirche te Leipzig begonnen maar al snel, geholpen door de West-Duitse televisie, ook in andere Oost-Duitse steden plaatsvonden. De demonstraties werden zo massaal (betogingen van 500,000 personen in Leipzig) dat de regering er geen harde maatregelen tegen durfde te ondernemen, temeer in het besef dat de Sovjet-Unie hen niet meer zou steunen. Uiteindelijk leidde dit tot de Val van de Muur, vrije verkiezingen in de DDR, en ten slotte de Duitse Hereniging in 1990., 20515=Toen begin 2011, na de val van de regeringen in de buurlanden, ook in LibiÃƒÂ« demonstraties uitbraken, werden deze met harde hand door het regime neergeslagen. Dit deed uiteindelijk de situatie escaleren, tot een groot aantal steden in opstand kwam en een deel van de politie, het leger en veel publieke functionarissen overliepen. Kadaffi verspeelde hiermee bovendien het krediet dat hij in het buitenland had, waarop de opstandelingen buitenlandse steun kregen en hierdoor in oktober 2011 het hele land konden veroveren en Kadaffi ten val brengen., 16626=Een van de bekendste massademonstraties is die van 28 augustus 1963, waarbij meer dan 250.000 van allerlei rassen bijeen kwamen om te demonstreren vÃƒÂ³ÃƒÂ³r rassengelijkheid. Tot dan toe gold een strikte rassenscheiding. Zo mochten zwarte mensen bijvoorbeeld niet in de bus van de blanken en mochten zwarte kinderen niet de scholen van blanke kinderen bezoeken. Datzelfde systeem bestond in Zuid-Afrika en werd daar apartheid genoemd. Op die bijeenkomst sprak dominee Martin Luther King zijn beroemde rede I Have a Dream uit., 21382=Na een aantal schrijnende verkrachtingszaken waarbij kleine kinderen het slachtoffer waren en/of het slachtoffer het niet overleefde, vonden begin 2013 demonstraties in India plaats waarbij werd gepleit voor een hardere en effectievere aanpak van zedenmisdrijven door politie en justitie., 18060=Hoewel de democratische rechten in China beperkt zijn, komen straatdemonstraties op grote schaal voor. Verspreid over heel China schat men dat op een aantal van 1000 per jaar. Het betreft evenwel bijna altijd kleine demonstraties tegen een bepaalde werkgever in verband met de slechte werkomstandigheden. Meestal gaat het niet om grote maatschappelijke demonstraties., 18510=Een uitzondering was de grote studentendemonstratie van juni 1989 op het Plein van de Hemelse Vrede in Peking, die bloedig werd neergeslagen door het leger: honderden lieten het leven, vele omstanders raakten gewond. Vele studenten zijn vervolgens spoorloos verdwenen.

Ruim 300.000 betogers kwamen bijeen en stapten door het centrum van Brussel. 23 oktober 1983, Brussel, de antirakettenbetoging met 400.000 betogers tegen de plaatsing van Amerikaanse atoomwapens in BelgiÃƒÂ«.

Men kan ten val komen en worden vertrappeld, met zwaar letsel of de dood tot gevolg. Ook gewelduitbarstingen bij escalatie kunnen riskant zijn voor deelnemers en omstanders. Betogingen zijn in zekere zin een 'risicovol' actiemiddel, omdat men zeker moet zijn dat men een significante opkomst kan mobiliseren. Wanneer men een betoging organiseert waarvoor bijna geen betogers komen opdagen heeft men in feite het omgekeerde aangetoond: dat er geen draagvlak bestaat voor de doelen van de betoging. Bovendien is demonstreren zoals eerder vermeld in veel landen in het geheel verboden en loopt men het risico opgepakt te worden. Een demonstratie kan ook averechts werken wanneer ze met geweld gepaard gaan of het","Nederland[bewerken] Demonstratie op het Museumplein in Amsterdam, 2 oktober 2004 De grootste demonstraties ooit in Nederland waren: 26 oktober 1923, Amsterdam, IJsclubterrein, tegen de Vlootwet, georganiseerd door de SDAP en het NVV, 70.000 deelnemers.

The Delphi approach was used where the opinion of H&S experts, academics and industry practitioners were canvassed on 64 potential indicator metrics, categorized in 10 elements or leading indicators that will enable H&S performance improvement e.g. reduction in accidents, injuries, diseases but to name a few. The experts rated each indicator metric on a 10-point Likert scale of impact, where 1= no major impact or 10% impact and 10 = major impact or 100% impact. Consensus was reached on 32 indicator metrics after four successive rounds of Delphi if the indicators attracted final scores of, percentage median impact of 90% to 100% which is 9.00 to 10.00 median rating and over 50% of respondents rating the indicator metrics in the band of 9.00 to 10.00 or 90% to 100% impact to improve H&S performance. The experts had the opportunity to reconsider their scores informed by the group median score in rounds 2, 3 and 4. The limitation of the study was the reliance of a structured questionnaire in the first round as experts were not allowed to add any new indicators, until the fourth round. This study contributes to the H&S body of knowledge where no consensus has been reached pertaining to the indicator metrics that have major impact to improve H&S performance at project level of construction SMEs in South Africa.', 'en', 'Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research', 'Ã‚Â© Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research, 2011.

You're going to be on your own and away from home with little supervision. On The Hill, we have these emergency buttons you can press if you don't feel safe at your present location. An officer will respond in less than 60 seconds and they can even escort you back to your dorm. I would advise that no one, especially the ladies, walk by themselves at night. Stay with at least 2 other people who you feel safe around. You can usually find a young gentleman to walk you back even."", ""The Greeks are very much alive and well on campus. Appropriately named ESW, or Every Sunny Wednesday, is where you will see most of the Greeks. This event is on-campus right by the bookstore from 12pm-2pm. You will see not only Greeks, but Non Greeks as well. Both types of organizations host events, especially around homecoming week. As a freshman, you won't be able to pledge until your sophomore year, but don't let that deter you from still becoming a member of a Non Greek organization."", 'There are many opportunities to join in on the fun on The Hill. For example, we have game and movie nights in the Ralph Lee Student Center. Not only can you enjoy all the activities offered, but you can also help plan them by joining the Program and Activities Council, or PAC. This committee makes all the activities possible because these members are students just like you. Feel free to offer insight to fellow members that you may know and see if one of your ideas can be brought to life on campus.', 'Alabama A&M is great for students who want to engage in anything having to do with agriculture or mechanics, hence the A and M in our name. A&M offers outstanding classes for students with those majors since that was what we were founded upon. Not to discourage any other possible majors, but it is very possible that you might consider changing your major once you explore what A&M has to offer.', ""On The Hill, there are many historical locations because of our rich history, but how many schools do you know of that actually have their president and his wife buried together? Not many, I'm sure. The president's house is also located on campus. The land our school is built on was originally used for slave auctioning. We even have the slave bath that was used to bathe the slaves before being sold to white slave owners. Our campus locations are far from unusual, but offer a glimpse of the past to its students."", ""There is ALWAYS something to do on campus. Most events are held at The Quad, which is right in the middle of campus where most student like to hang out anyway. Some of these events will be announced, whether via email, word of mouth, or posted flyers around campus, but some won't. It doesn't hurt you to just explore campus during your free time. You never know what you might run into."", ""Everybody thinks that any food that comes out of a cafeteria is gross and has some kind of mystery meat aspect about it. At Alabama A&M, however, there is a variety of of options in the cafe. They even offer vegetarian options for lunch and dinner. I would advise you though, especially incoming freshmen, to get food for your room. There will be days that you will not want to walk down to the cafe considering how crazy the weather gets on The Hill. Some dorms don't allow refrigerators or microwaves, but usually the dorm will have one for everyone to use."", 'Dorm life at Alabama A&M is what you make it. I think the females are more worried about the living situations than the guys. Living with other females cant definitely be an experience. In most dorms, there are community bathrooms and showers. There is going to be little privacy considering the fact that you will be living with someone else for the next 10 months. If you and your roommate are comfortable enough around each other, it will work out for the better. Make sure to invest in a shower caddy to carry all your bathroom essentials, a bathrobe as you will be having to walk to and from the shower, and shower shoes because you can never be to sure in community showers. Also, make sure you and your roommate set up a cleaning schedule because there will be UNNANOUNCED room checks every week and you do not want to fail.', 'The academic courses offered at Alabama A&M have some rigor to them. The rigor of your courses you will be taking at first will depend on your COMPASS test scores. Take this test very seriously because this determines how your classes will be set. If you feel that you need a little more rigor than what you have, you can always join the Honors Program offered on campus. For one, it looks good on your resume, but it also better prepares you for those upper-level courses you will soon be taking after your freshman year.', ""I would definitely encourage prospective students to do their research on this school. You don't want to be one of those students who just applied to where you thought you could get in. You need to be prepared to be asked what brought you you to A&M? or what made you choose A&M?. Anyone can ask you, even the president whom you may see around campus. Be knowledgeable of our surroundings. Also, be prepared for numerous due dates and deadlines, sometimes one right after the other. Get a planner or something to write in to keep yourself organized. Your phone calendar or notepad is no longer a reliable source because it is very likely that your phone battery will die during the course of a day and you are nowhere near your dorm or charger. Time management is also a vital skill that you will need to master. Being on your own and making your own schedule will make you realize that you will have a lot of free time that you can either waste or use productively. Lastly, even though this is college and it is to be taken seriously, HAVE FUN. In college, you will experience things you probably won't ever experience again in your lifetime. These next 4 years will be the best of your life, enjoy them!"", ""It's in my blood! I cannot lie!

You move through the material very quickly and are expected to actively contribute in every class. The class sizes are very small (average 15 students, although this may change as Denison's population grows), and you are expected to do quite a bit of reading to prepare for each class. Also, no matter what your major, you will be expected to write papers. In my experience, my papers were anywhere from 5 to 25 pages in length, with my senior research landing around 50.

What I can say is that I do not know if I would have been able to get through that time in my life while studying at any other school or with any other professors. You will find that at Denison the professors you work with - or even just the professors in the department you primarily work in - actually care about you and what is going on in your life.

That's one of the best parts of Denison. The professors love working here, and it shows. Thus, the students all benefit and come away with more than they might have at another school. One fault I can mention is that it is not as easy to learn practical life skills (street smarts) here as at many bigger schools. We are, for the most part, trained to operate in the impractical, scholarly realm. By no means is it impossible to learn street smarts here, just more difficult.

You can walk around at 2 in the morning and be as safe as 2 in the afternoon. Denison is monitored 24/7 by campus PD and has almost immediate access to Granville PD. That being said, as with any campus, Denison does have its (small) share of student code violations. However, these violations are handled swiftly, and students really try to look after one another. Greek Life While Denison does have several sororities and fraternities, its Greek life isn't typical of most campuses.

They not exactly active aside from stupid pranks (such as burning a W into the lawn)."", ""If you limit this to academics, I would give Denison five stars. The classes are small and involved, and professors go out of their way to make time for students and questions. The tutor service is free and easy to receive, the library is extensive due to the OhioLINK program which connects all the Ohio Five schools, and there are several computer labs with printers all over campus. The buildings are also well maintained, and constant upgrades are put into place, such as both our dining halls are being renovated this year. However, my rating decrease stems from the expense of housing and dining. The dining plans are very limiting- you can either spend a lot for meal swipes to the halls, or you can redirect that money to Denison Dollars, which can only be spend in the Student Union anyways. Neither option is very satisfying. The dorms are in fair condition, but they are simply not worth the money you pay. I'm sure this can be said of every college, but due to the required residency on campus for all four years, you will not be able to look for more competitive housing in Granville."", ""Don't depend on any sort of local scene for fun. The main advantage of Denison is that the school resources are always being put to use, including concerts, comedians, and events in the Student Union. Due to restrictions put into effect by administration, and the absence of Greek housing, parties are normally held in cramped dorm rooms. This past year has led to increased rules, including a Party Registration System, so if this is your goal in coming to college, I would suggest another school."", ""Something to note is that Denison is changing their food supply company from Sodexco, who has worked with the school for forty years. The food isn't bad, just repetitive. There are always salad bars, fruit, and sandwich stations available throughout the day. Pizza and pasta is normally offered with lunch and dinner. There is usually one entree that is always vegetarian, as well as a gluten-free dessert area for those who need it, but the selection is limited."", 'Again, it depends a lot on those around you. I live in the freshman quiet dorm, and compared to the rest of campus it is very controlled. Other dorms, such as those on East Quad and Shorney/Smith on West Quad, can get out of control. This year in particular has been a battle between students and the admisinstration over issues of drinking and EMS runs. However, there are certainly dorms and people who remain uninvolved with any party scene.', 'Academics are heavily dependent on your major and its classes. Communications and Psychology classes act as a catch-all for people who are there for reasons other than school. Most of the sciences (mostly comprised of Chemistry, Biology, and Computer Science) are extremely strict in their class requirements and expectations. Humanities such as English and Area Studies are dependent on the teacher. Most professors are fair, but they expect attendance and effort from students.', ""1. Denison sets aside a lot of money for the use of clubs, and looks for students who want to be involved. Get involved with something you enjoy and STICK WITH IT. Don't try to pad your application, instead prove that you are dedicated and follow through. 2. Take advantage of essays to reflect someone who is eloquent and open-minded. Denison takes pride in providing opportunities to broaden your mind, and they want students who will appreciate it. 3. Don't depend on Denison scholarships to carry the day. Apply for anything you can, but there are National Merit Finalists here (my roommate is one) who still didn't get offers to supplement federal aid."", 'Although the campus is small and can feel suffocating at first, students on campus are very involved and the professors are second to none. There are dozens of clubs on campus, and Student Services are very liberal about funding and space.

Almost everyone I know has the campus security number on their phones. You can call them in case of emergencies or even if you were studying late at night at the library and don't want to make the trek back to your room at night - they'll come and pick you up! They are known to be slightly stricter on the party culture, mostly for the first years but everyone knows it is because they care for our safety. I have had a campus security officer pick my friends and I off, dropped us off at our dorm and even gave us 2 boxes of pizza. Earlier, at finals week, they stood outside in the cold with posters, handing out snacks and cheering us on to give us the energy and motivation we need to finish our exams. I can walk to different buildings, or back to my dorm at 3AM and still feel completely safe. The dorms can be accessed by your student ID card, but you can only open your own dorm after midnight."", ""There are a variety of clubs on campus, fit to cater every students wants and needs. From multicultural, to the arts, community service, sports, and more, there's something for everyone. There are also a lot of unofficial clubs and things to do - many students organize and host a variety of talks, showing how Denison encourages students to be proactive to make a difference. The school also brings in different speakers and performers, and hosts different events such as the Gala for fun, dancing, and good food.

That being said, Denison is also extremely generous with their scholarship and financial aid. Most of my friends have received large scholarships that help significantly with tuition costs.

You have a wide variety of classes to choose from, and the school is constantly hosting events, bringing in speakers and performers.', ""The food and dining are possibly Denison's weaker suits, but there are plenty of options to choose from! There are two dining halls as well as a space called Slayter Union that has multiple snack/meal bars where you can order food for on the go, but there is also an area to sit and eat. The dining services do try hard to provide healthy and a variety of options but it is usually a hit or a miss. They have a great dessert area however as well as lots of drink options and the dining staff are extremely nice! If you feel like going out to eat, its an easy walk down to Granville, which has multiple restaurants that provide large meals for reasonable prices catered towards college students. The school also provides shuttles to the mall to go out and eat."", ""The dorms are all pretty nice, not too small but not particularly big - basically what you'd expect of a college dorm. The largest freshman dorm I've found is really friendly because everyone leaves their doors open (if you want) to interact and make new friends. They are clean, regularly maintained by a cleaning staff, and you have 2 RAs on each floor who are very active and maintain a welcoming and safe community. Unfortunately, for some dorms, and my room especially, one side of the wall is thin so you can hear everything that goes on in the other room (this does NOT happen for every room/dorm!) If you have loud/sociable neighbours however, this can be a pain in the butt. Overall the dorms are pretty nice and homey!"", 'Denison is very academically rigorous, the teachers expect a lot from you, and know that you can handle their assignments. That being said, academic honesty is also taken very seriously so it is up to you to try your very best. So far, I have had great professors who are all very accessible and friendly and who care about how you are doing and know you by name! I think thats one of the best things about attending smaller schools, especially ones like Denison, because even though the work is difficult, you have your professors there to help if you are lost and make you want to do well. Because class sizes are smaller, you are expected to contribute and be actively engaged. You will move through the material quickly and should keep up with the readings to get the most out of the class.', ""If you feel like you're not as academically strong, definitely go out and join clubs, sports, community service (as early as you can!), as the school does consider your extracurriculars. Also, work hard on your application essays to really showcase who you are and why you feel like you belong at Denison, showing them that you will be an active participant of the community who has something to offer!

As for unusual locations on campus: Denison is an old college (around since 1831) and has two cemeteries on campus grounds. Bang for the buck Denison is expensive; there is no doubt about it.

The response to HUD's solicitation of public comment was lower than what HUD expected, and HUD is therefore reopening the public comment period and will seek additional comments through January 15, 2015., 8375=This proposed rule would amend existing project-based Section 8 regulations related to Management and Occupancy Reviews (MORs) and Vacancy Payments for the following programs: the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Programs for New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, State Housing Agencies, New Construction financed under Section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, the Loan Management Set-Aside Program, the HAP Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects, and the Section 202/8 Program. This rule would also amend the existing Section 162 regulations related to Vacancy Payments for the Section 202 Projects. Under this rule, MORs would be conducted in accordance with a schedule published in the Federal Register and subject to public comment. The first such schedule is being published for comment concurrently with this proposed rule, and can be found elsewhere in today's Federal Register . HUD is proposing this change in order to reduce the frequency of MORs, thereby minimizing interruptions in property operations created by onsite reviews, preserving staff time, and reducing costs. In addition, this proposed rule would reduce the vacancy payments made to the owner by HUD for a vacant assisted unit., 18473=This proposed rule would implement amendments made by the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2010 (Section 202 Act of 2010) and the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (Melville Act) to the authorizing statutes for HUD's supportive housing for the elderly program, known as the Section 202 program, and the supportive housing for persons with disabilities program, known as the Section 811 program. These two statutes were enacted on January 4, 2011, and made important reforms to the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, several of which have already been implemented through separate issuances, as discussed in the Supplementary Information section of this rule. In addition to proposing regulations to implement reforms of these two statutes, this proposed rule would implement several other changes to align with the amendments made by the January 4, 2011, statutes, and streamline the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to better provide supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities. This proposed rule would establish the requirements and procedures for the use of new project rental assistance for supportive housing for persons with disabilities; the implementation of an enhanced project rental assistance contract; allowance of a set-aside for a number of units for elderly individuals with functional limitations or other category of elderly persons as defined in the notice of funding availability (NOFA); make significant changes for the prepayment of certain loans for supportive housing for the elderly; implement a new form of rental assistance called Senior Preservation Rental Assistance Contracts (SPRACs); modernize the capital advance for supportive housing for persons with disabilities; and provide grant assistance for applicants without sufficient capital to prepare a site for a funding competition.

The original comment period closed on October 27, 2014. NMFS is reopening the comment period for an additional 15 days to provide the public additional time to comment on this proposed rule. If implemented, the proposed rule would establish a comprehensive regulatory program for managing the development of an environmentally sound and economically sustainable aquaculture industry in Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). The purpose of the proposed rule is to increase the yield of Federal fisheries in the Gulf by supplementing the harvest of wild caught species with cultured product., 15752=Ã‚Â§ 1802 - Definitions, 12772=This final rule implements a management framework for specifying catch and effort limits and accountability measures for pelagic fisheries in the U.S. Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Using the established framework, NMFS is also specifying a catch limit of 2,000 metric tons (mt) of longline-caught bigeye tuna for each territory for 2014. A territory may allocate up to 1,000 mt of that limit to eligible U.S. longline fishing vessels. This final rule also makes several technical administrative changes to the regulations and announces the effectiveness of collection-of-information requirements. This action is consistent with international objectives of ending overfishing of bigeye tuna, while allowing for the limited transfer of available catch limits between U.S participating territories and eligible U.S. fisheries, consistent with the conservation requirements of the bigeye tuna stock., 15652=Ã‚Â§ 1801 - Findings, purposes and policy, 15834=Ã‚Â§ 1803 - Authorization of appropriations}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 79 FR 77399 - Vessel Monitoring Systems; Requirements for Enhanced Mobile Transceiver Unit and Mobile Communication Service Type-Approval 2014-12-24; vol. 79 # 247 - Wednesday, December 24, 2014 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.
