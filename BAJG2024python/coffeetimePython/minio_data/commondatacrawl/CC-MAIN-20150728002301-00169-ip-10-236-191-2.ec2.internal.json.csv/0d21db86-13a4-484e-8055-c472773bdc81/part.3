Once you get all your core classes completed and it meets the requirements of other colleges/universities, you have a better chance of getting into that college. This school can be a real pain in the butt because the administrative make it that way. These past few years or so, they've accepted more students than there are seats to fill in. Professors have to modify their teachings to accommodate the levels of these students.

Solve the situation yourself since they go after you for financial problems and if that doesn't work, get your parents involved, you get the idea.

Don't think that everyone is going to laugh at you because you're going to a community college. I've learned it the hard way. Take all your core classes at a 2-year college, verify the credits will transfer, before you come to MCPHS. Even if those credits don't transfer, don't think MCPHS is your only option. Once you get all your core classes completed and it meets the requirements of other colleges/universities, you have a better chance of getting into that college. This school can be a real pain in the butt because the administrative make it that way. These past few years or so, they've accepted more students than there are seats to fill in. Professors have to modify their teachings to accommodate the levels of these students. It also means that they'd have to hire more faculty and construction workers to tear up small spaces and create bigger lecture halls, etc. Be weary, the school tends to rip you off on financial aid money but be persistent. Solve the situation yourself since they go after you for financial problems and if that doesn't work, get your parents involved, you get the idea.

I am currently about to start my sophomore year and I feel with the help and opportunities I had freshman year that I am ready to face the challenges on taking classes more in-depth to my major. Mizzou has a great general education requirement that allowed me to take classes that were outside my major and I primarily had no interest in, that opened my eyes to other opportunities and actually lead me to change my major to biology based on my general requirement class and how much I enjoyed the subject and the professors. Mizzou has also helped me gain confidence in my studies, before I was a constant C- math student always ruining my A/B's with that one C in math, but thanks to the Learning Center ( a student oriented, free tutoring service) they paired me with the perfect tutor who was willing to go above and beyond and helped me come out of Algebra with a new appreciation for the subject.

There is so much to do at Mizzou I can barely touch base on it, every club you can think of is there, and even some that might peak your interest in something new. I wanted to try something new and now I work on the television show the Dynamo Effect for MUTV and have made some great friends, joining a club that is relevant for your major and one for something you may enjoy can help you strike a balance between work and play. Also Mizzou has a great dorm systems where they aren't too far apart for each other so visiting friends is a breeze and the nightlife is amazing for a town its size. The downtown area blends into the campus being a 10 minute walk from the center (Brady Commons) of campus. There are lots of nights for the under 21 crowd as well as places to eat and vintage and boutiques to shop at. The sporting events make for a fun free night (or discounted if you have a student pass) and every Friday night Mizzou after Dark plans something free for students, $5 for the public to do. I am 12 hours away from home and started out knowing not one person there. Now I am making friends that feel like family and making great grades for college that I didn't think I was prepared for.

Being in the journalism school myself, I am aware that it is top tier in the country and I will not be hard pressed to find a job after graduation. The experience j students earn at Mizzou is unlike any other institution in the United States- not to mention the study abroad internship opportunities for students of any background.

Also, if you already know what career you want and you're going to live in a dorm, check out the Freshman Interest Groups and Learning Communities on Mizzou's school website- basically you can live on the same floor as people w/the same interest as you. Also, try not to get more than 15 credit hours your first semester- there's going to be a lot of sports, clubs, and other activities going on, so you don't want to overload by adding a ton of school work. Take the first semester to adjust, then add more classes second semester if you think you're ready."", ""Mizzou is pretty expensive for out-of-staters, but residents of MO get great deals- very low in-state tuition and LOTS of resident scholarships. There aren't many scholarships for non-residents, so the first year might be a bit expensive.

Mizzou has a great educational system but there's definitely no denying that it's a party school, so if you're into partying, this is the place to be.

If you can get your own place after your first year I recommend doing it as it will save you quite a lot of money. I also recommend summer classes at a community college if its necessary that you take them, as they are much cheaper that what you would pay here for the same amount of credit hours. While Mizzou is really expensive, I believe they do put their money to good use. The campus is huge and the buildings are beautiful-especially the new student center and the bookstore. The Rec center is another great big place your money is spent on and it shows; the equipment and facilities are all top notch. Mizzou has also been doing a lot of remodeling lately, so they are trying to make the campus a nicer place. Most of the dorms have been remodeled already and some are still on the list. The only thing about the dorms you maybe upset about is the lack of space, but hey-its college and that's pretty much expected. At least everything is clean and new."", ""I love Columbia and Mizzou.

They know what they are talking about thankfully, but some don't really know how to get the information across. Can't say I've been too impressed about that, although there are some grad. instructors that I would absolutely recommend (esp. in the classics department), so its kind of a 50/50 when it comes to grad instructors. I haven't been too impressed with the psychology grad instructors at all though. But graduate students aren't always a bad thing, and the larger your school is, the more of them there are likely to be. Its really only the lower level classes that they teach at, so as you move up in your college career, the more likely you are to have experienced instructors. But of course your experiences with each one will always be different. There really is a wide range of okay to amazing here and thankfully I have yet to run into any downright 'bad.'

Another tunnel runs from the basement of Jesse Hall to Switzler Hall. The best way to achieve this is to find a man hole that is covered by grates, but beware of the alarm system. 3.kiss the 50-yard line at Faurot field that is named after coach Don Faurot. In order to do this you need to figure out how to get through the locked gate, but rumor has it that there are silent motion sensors on the field. 4.Streaking across the Quad is the fourth tradition. The only way to approach this to build up the courage and to not look back. 5.ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza. The tiger is roughly around 11 feet tall. When climbing the tiger, it is best to have someone help you up. You can get extra points for having more people on the tiger at one time. 6.swim in Brady Foundation located in Tiger Plaza as well.

I've never witnessed in any criminal activity or known anyone to be victim of a crime. But whenever a crime is reported on campus there is usually an email to notify students. Through the course of the year though I believe I've received no more than 10 of them. Also, there are poles with emergency buttons on campus to signal MU police. I would recommend ladies to not walk by themselves late at night or really early morning and if you do carry protection like pepper spray or talk on the phone with a friend."", 'Greek Life is not dominant on campus. There are a lot of Greek organizations but nothing really sets them apart from Greek organizations on other campuses. They party, do a few fundraisers, volunteer work, and put on okay step shows. Many of the minority Greek organizations put on probates which are public ceremonies to showcase their new members. I am not involved in Greek Life though so I can not say too much about it.', 'There are over 600, enough said. Most likely you can find an organization for just about anything and if you do not, you can start one and possibly get funding for it.', ""Mizzou is great for a variety of students. It is great for those that are social and seek to make connections because there are plenty to make. I believe it's best suited for those seeking a good education while at the same time wanting to get involved. Whether on campus or in the Columbia community, there are plenty of ways for students to be active. It is easy to be the student that stays only in their studies but you also can be the student who does well in their studies and takes an active role in the community."", ""There are a lot of traditions at Mizzou.

I forewarn anyone that wants to attempt these that some of them are illegal."", 'The cost of a college education in general is high. When comparing the cost of attendance of Mizzou to other comparable schools it is reasonably priced. All in all, Mizzou is a great institution. It has an atmosphere conducive to learning but also fun and relaxation. Mizzou is a worthwhile investment for those that are going to take advantage of what is available to them. Although tuition has increased this past year due to state budget cuts, school administration is committed to keeping cost of attendance down to make affording an education there attainable to most. For those needing extra financial help, I recommend applying for as many scholarships as you can. There are scholarship offered through the school for incoming freshman, continuing students, and different departments. Also, there are on campus jobs for students. I emphasize strongly, it is important with any money you get you need to manage it wisely.', 'There is always something going on on campus or in Columbia. There are events the Greeks put on, concerts, plays, and our amazing Rec Center. You can take classes there, get massages, go swimming, rock climb, and oh yeah workout. Admittance for students is free but classes and massages are paid for. Football and basketball game weekends are extremely popular but you must pay for them. All other sports students receive free admittance. In the Student Center, there is a place called The Shack where students can come and play Kinect, pool, and foosball.', ""Whether or not you have a meal plan is up to you. Using your meal plan at dining hall is a full meal, using it at various other campus eateries counts as partial meals. Meals don't carry over to the next semester so use them or lose them. In the dining halls, there are a lot of tasty foods and most are not too unhealthy. A downside is the few food options if you are a vegetarian or vegan. Since there are so many students, at some dining halls there can be long waits just to just get in and then an even longer waits for some lines. There are plenty of restaurants not far in downtown Columbia if you're not in the mood for dining hall food. Also, there are places on campus where you can pick up food like deli sandwiches, Asian cuisine, baked goods, and etc."", 'Never use the word dorm around the housing staff. On campus housing facilities are referred to as residence halls. This is because dorm is a variant of a French word meaning to sleep and staff wants to emphasize the experience in the residence halls should be more than about just sleeping. Every hall has learning communities such as education, engineering, pangea (pairs foreign and local students as roommates), and general. For incoming freshman, there are groups called FIGS which are learning communities that help freshman of similar majors get acquainted with one another. I am unable to elaborate on the experience of being in a FIG since I was not involved in one myself. Housing staff has implemented programs like this and others because they want students to feel they are part of a community. If you live in a residence hall with many floors I suggest you try to live on a floor near the first level. In my experience, the elevators stopped about once every week and that can be annoying when you are in a rush to class. Cost of living in on campus housing is relatively high due to its convenience. Another expense is laundry. It costs a $1.25 to wash and another $1.25 to dry. Even though it can be costly, on campus living can be nice because most halls are comfortable, kept clean, look nice, and have the close to class convenience.', ""Classes I've had at Mizzou have been pretty straightforward. You have class then you have assignments which include homework (mostly online), quizzes, and exams. Most of my professors held PhD's and were well informed. How difficult a class is depends on the class, teacher, and mainly what you are skilled at. There are plenty of resources available for help to students that are struggling. Teachers are accessible and free student tutoring services are available. It is very important to attend class, study, and to stay on top of you work. You can get a quality education but you have to be willing to put in the time an effort necessary to attain it. The atmosphere of Mizzou is conducive to learning which helps make an enjoyable academic experience."", ""Some of the best advice I can give is to have goals, have a plan for how you are going to stick to those goals, adjust them when necessary, and stay on track with what is important. Even though it can have a smaller feel Mizzou is a large campus with over 30,000 students. Class sizes can be pretty large if they pertain to areas such as social science, humanities, or general education. At least one professor you have as an undergraduate student is going to be foreign with an accent that may be hard to understand. If you run into this problem try and find a student that does understand them or go see them during office hours to listen to them more and see if understanding them becomes easier. Make connections with those that have the right mindsets for success. Strive for a high GPA your first year and aim to keep it high. That first year is very important because it can set a tone for how you do in following years. Also, there are many resources and opportunities including both academic and extra-curricular so take advantage of them. Don't get over involved though; remember as a student, school is your main priority."", ""At Mizzou you can get the ultimate college experience. It's an institution where you can enjoy getting a great education and develop to prepare for the world. Along with having a beautiful campus and pleasant atmosphere, the institution offers many opportunities that cultivate students both inside and outside of the classroom.""]]",University of Missouri (Mizzou) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Missouri/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/17470,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,95,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00169-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898044739,897890048,HORIZONTAL,,"07/15/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 39 out of 40 people found this review useful. 1 of 206 Philip from Saint Louis, MO Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Use your resources- YOU ARE PAYING FOR SCHOOL, and basically a lot of salaries around there so don't let anyone a professor, TA or tutor take advantage of that, get help when you realize you need it and before it becomes too late.

Mizzou has a great general education requirement that allowed me to take classes that were outside my major and I primarily had no interest in, that opened my eyes to other opportunities and actually lead me to change my major to biology based on my general requirement class and how much I enjoyed the subject and the professors. Mizzou has also helped me gain confidence in my studies, before I was a constant C- math student always ruining my A/B's with that one C in math, but thanks to the Learning Center ( a student oriented, free tutoring service) they paired me with the perfect tutor who was willing to go above and beyond and helped me come out of Algebra with a new appreciation for the subject. Of course what is college with out your extracurricular and social life? There is so much to do at Mizzou I can barely touch base on it, every club you can think of is there, and even some that might peak your interest in something new.

Most of the activity is contained to one part of campus with Greek row and the previously listed dorms but due to its size you will see Greek members everywhere. If you are not interested in it there is not pressure to get involved but if you are looking to join there is the possibility to fully immerse yourself here. During recruitment you can hear and see which house fits you best and if accepted get the chance to live in one of the gorgeous houses.', 'There are too many clubs on campus to count totaling somewhere in the 600Γƒ\x83Γ‚ΒΆΓƒ\x82?Γƒ\x82?s ranging from academic clubs to TV show fan clubs to skydiving. If youre interested in it there is a chance they already have it, and if not you can start your own club. As a heads up you have to go find the clubs and sometimes pay a fee to join as they are not short on possible members. If you genuinely do enjoy the club though I highly recommend doing so as it is a great way to meet friends and make campus feel a little smaller.', 'As long as you can find your major here Mizzou is pretty great for everybody. If the program you are in academically satisfies you then the rest of the experience here can be easily custom tailored to give you what you are looking for.', 'Official Mizzou Traditions: 1. Climb Jesse Hall (will get charged with trespassing if caught) 2. Ride the Tiger 3. Streak the Quad (several fines if caught for this one) 4.

If your out of state and willing to spend the summer after your freshman year here it not to bad either. The residency requirements for Missouri are one of the easiest in the nation and after you achieve in state status it can work out to be less than your in-state school (ie. U of Illinois). I will say diversity scholarships are by far the easiest and most available scholarships to get but if you donΓƒ\x83Γ‚ΒΆΓƒ\x82?Γƒ\x82?t qualify for those some searching on the web for department specific scholarships or looking at outside sources can help meet this gap.', 'For fun events there is a huge range depending on what you are interested in. If you enjoy going to parties there several opportunities to find them or nights where clubs are 18+. For those who are interested in other activities you can play sport like sand volleyball or soccer (field lights are on till 2 A.M.), see performances at the Blue Note or other venus, watch a free movie provided weekly by Mizzou, do craft events at Mizzou After Dark, or hang out in the dorms with friends.', 'AMAZING!!! There is nothing to complain about in terms of dining options here as there are several on campus dining halls or alternative locations to go to. Most places allow for a custom orders which allows you to eat as healthy or unhealthy as you choose (although IΓƒ\x83Γ‚ΒΆΓƒ\x82?Γƒ\x82?m sure everybody will give into their desserts). My only drawback is that the dining hall hours can sometimes conflict with your schedule but a couple Easy Macs here and there will solve that issue.', 'Dorm life here is great as most of the dorms are remodeled. They range in size proportional to how much you pay but I lived in Hudson (the smaller dorm rooms) and didnΓƒ\x83Γ‚ΒΆΓƒ\x82?Γƒ\x82?t mind the space as it encouraged us to hang out outside a lot. I highly recommend if possible to get a double over a single if you are debating because it is way worth it to lose some space as a means to getting a meal buddy and person to help get you through the first couple awkward weeks. For those looking to join in greek life the most common dorms are Laws, Lathrop, Jones, North/Center, or South.', 'The academics here are not very difficult during you first 3 semesters but quickly pick up once you move further into your major. It is a large transition from high school in that your teachers will not make an effort to help you first and there are only a couple of assigments/test that will make up your entire grade. However, if you take the time in the beginning of the semester to mark down important due dates in your assignment book and study accordingly you shouldnΓƒ\x83Γ‚ΒΆΓƒ\x82?Γƒ\x82?t have an issue with your grades.', 'If you can come here with your major in mind or at least a possible major you are willing to declare do it because it will boost your chances for scholarships immensely. Also, AP scores are accepted here and can save you thousands of dollars if you take enough in high school. While other schools might not take them Mizzou does (google their score requirements) so take as many as you can while you can I promise it will be worth it!! And if your wondering the rigor of a class check out GPA distribution for University of Missouri for the previous students grades.', 'Mizzou is a great school that works towards be very well rounded in academics, social activies, and sports.

You never have to worry about a bored night at Mizzou."", ""The dining halls can be addictive so be careful! You will get the freshmen 15 if you aren't. There are about 6 dining halls to choose from in addition to random restaurants all over campus. The food is great. Most places will make all your food the way you like individually and give you lots of options. Late night Rollins is open until 1:00am everyday and Subway on campus is 24hrs. You have a meal plan that you will select at the start of the semester. there are 4 to choose from. I chose the 3rd option and had more than enough food for the school year."", ""Dorm Life is amazing! I had a really nice time staying on campus. Going to class is so convenient. It doesn't take more than 5-10 mins to walk to any class. Depending on where you live on campus, your hall will have several events throughout the school year. I stayed in Hawthorn one of the best places to live on Campus. We had BBQs, floor parties, and hangouts with people from our floor. There is no curfew and you're even allowed to have guests over for up to a week. If you have a chill floor monitor they won't care anyway. Laundry rooms are directly under the building so in those colds months you don't have to walk in the cold to take of that."", ""Mizzou is as challenging as you make it for yourself. I know people who literally did nothing the entire first semester but that's obviously not going to beneficial to them in the long run. You aren't forced to go to classes in most cases, but some classes do take attendance as well as give some type of grade for it. You should find out your first day of class what's to be expected of you. Some classes also post all the lectures online so class is optional. I prefer to go to class because at least to me, it's easier to remember that way. As long as you do your work and make an effort to study 2-3 days before the test you'll be fine."", ""Deadlines are crucial! Always to try to get applications done relatively early. Never be afraid to contact the different schools at Mizzou for any questions you may have. Mizzou's official website is the place to be for any info you may need. Also once you've set up your Myzou account play around and get used to the setup.

Think about who you are and what you really want before jumping just because this is an attractive school, because there's no doubt that it is beautiful here. Do your research!!!! I cannot stress this enough. If you can find a school that is a better value for you, GO THERE! Mizzou is very pricey for the experience that I've received so far. I'm already considering a transfer and it's still really early in my college career."", 'If you have a hard time adjusting to new places, you might want to rethink coming to this university. The vast amount of people that attend Mizzou make it hard to meet others with your interests and can sometimes make you feel insignificant.

Calibration of the instrument was performed with a direct-reading","4.3. Stability Test Procedure: A long-term evaluation of sample media stability was performed to determine any potential problems if delays in sample analyses occur. Five-layer aluminized gas sampling bags (5-L) containing generated samples were used to assess CO storage stability. Samples were generated at 1 and 2 ΓƒΒ— TWA PEL and 80% RH. Samples were analyzed at various times up to 39 days after sample collection. Samples were also generated at 0.5 ΓƒΒ— TWA PEL and 80% RH; however, a few of the bags used for this experiment appeared to have some leakage and technical problems occurred during analysis. Results: Recovery data are listed in Table 3 and graphically represented in Figure 3 (normalized data). One result for 1 ΓƒΒ— PEL at 8 days of storage is not included in Figure 3 since it appeared to be unrealistically high; The GC appeared to display some instability on the day these samples were analyzed. Previously, different types of gas sampling bags were evaluated for stability, structural integrity, and compactness. The five-layer aluminized bag (5-L) was considered more durable than Tedlar or Saran. The storage stability of CO using this sampling bag was acceptable for up to two weeks. In this time frame, average sample recoveries were within 10% of what was found at the beginning of each experiment. Significant",False,-1,0,,
