³¿Øú¡ßS`=¼yåÞ4pnË*!øAzÌV¢S XÂ—Ìgoals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area., 35481=NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the West Yakutat District of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 2015 total allowable catch of Pacific ocean perch in the West Yakutat District of the GOA., 198261=NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from vessels using jig gear to catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 meters) length overall using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area. This action is necessary to allow the A season apportionment of the 2015 total allowable catch of Pacific cod to be harvested., 277413=NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Bering Sea subarea of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 2014 Pacific ocean perch total allowable catch (TAC) in the Bering Sea subarea of the BSAI., 305196=NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from catcher vessels using trawl gear to catcher vessels using hook-and-line gear, vessels using pot gear, and vessels using jig gear in the Western Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska management area (GOA). This action is necessary to allow the 2014 total allowable catch of Pacific cod in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA to be harvested., 184183=NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in critical habitat of the Central Aleutian district (CAI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island management area (BSAI) by vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the A season allowance of the 2015 Atka mackerel total allowable catch (TAC) in critical habitat of the CAI allocated to vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery., 364425=NMFS proposes regulations to reduce the maximum retainable amount (MRA) of skates using groundfish and halibut as basis species in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) from 20 percent to 5 percent. Reducing skate MRAs is necessary to decrease the incentive for fishermen to target skates and slow the catch rate of skates in these fisheries. This proposed rule would enhance conservation and management of skates and minimize skate discards in GOA groundfish and halibut fisheries. This proposed rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska, and other applicable laws., 290833=NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch in the Eastern Aleutian district (EAI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) by vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 2014 total allowable catch (TAC) of Pacific ocean perch in the EAI allocated to vessels participating in the BSAI trawl limited access fishery., 175383=NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 meters (m)) length overall (LOA) using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI).
