If you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then the tuition cost is even less. If you qualify, there are scholarships offered to help even more with tuition.

The students are friendly and friends can be found all around you! There are plenty of activities offered for entertainment. Take a break from studying, get with some friends and enjoy a movie, watch a performance, attend a sporting event, and much more. The campus is beautifully maintained and offers many quiet spots to study, bask in the sun, or simply chat with friends.

The professors are also willing to talk with students one-on-one if a student so desires. The general education requirements, although they may seem tedious at first, offer you a peek into a variety of areas and give you a more well-rounded educational experience.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities.

That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

Only members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with valid recommend can enter these sacred buildings. A phenomenon at BYU is the relatively higher population of married students. Family is at the core of LDS doctrine. Please do not be surprised when you see married couples in their early 20s or young parents of that age.', 'What to do for fun when you are surrounded by mountains? Hiking is something you could do with a group of friends all year round. There are several locations for you to try out, one of them being the famed Y Mountain. Since you are in the mountains, look into skiing and snowboarding. BYU even offers classes that teach you how to do them. The student government, BYUSA, frequently sponsors events around campus with prizes, fun games, and sometimes free food for the students. When it is all said and done, sports events are your safest bet for a good time. Students can purchase an All-Sports Pass each year that allow them to attend any university athletic event. The Harris Fine Arts Center hosts musicals, recitals, concerts, etc. for those who prefer more artsy activities. With the exceptions of bars, popular gathering places include bowling alleys, mini golf courts, and intramural sports! There are many options for you to choose from and you will not be bored if you seek them out.', 'Students can choose to have a meal plan for on-campus locations or cook for themselves where facilities are available. The place to get a balanced meal is the Cannon Center, which operate under a buffet-like system. It is a great place to eat, especially if you are new to BYU. There are also familiar food places such as Taco Bell and Subway scattered across and around the campus. Some of the campus buildings also contain restaurants such as the LegendÃ¢\x80\x99s Grille and Cafeteria at the Museum of Art. Spend some time explore the campus and you shall some interesting gourmet experiences while you attend school. Last of all, it would not hurt to learn how to cook, or experiment with cooking. College is a great time to explore career options and new things. Culinary experience just another one of those things that adds to your BYU experience.', 'Dorm life is great here at BYU, especially if you are a freshman. It allows you to make friends closer to your age and may relieve some agitations caused by leaving home for the first time. Due to the religious nature of the university, students will interact with almost everyone in their immediate vicinity. Dorms, as well as other BYU-approved housing, have their rules. There are certain visiting hours for members of the opposite sex, which details the Honor Code outlines. For dorms, there are resident assistants who can guide and help new students. Again, freshmen do not have to live on-campus. If you have friends in town and want to live with them, by all means, have fun! The support system is similar wherever you choose to live around BYU.', 'BYU has one of the top business schools in the country. The J. Reuben Clark Law School is among the top law schools in the country. The School of Fine Arts produces world-reputable performers in arts such as ballroom dancing, etc. Since BYU is also one of the universities that produce many graduate degree pursuers, it is providing the higher education sought by career-driven and academic-minded individuals. The optional Spring and Summer Terms allow students to take classes in half the time allotted during the semester, giving students a more challenging environment, and sometimes gain greater progress than peers who only attend classes during Fall and Winter semester. For someone who wants to graduate faster, BYU is definitely a place for consideration. If you are seeking a professional degree, BYU has its own prep courses to help you with the MCAT, LSAT, etc. The costs of these courses are usually a third of what you would pay for big name helpers such as Kaplan.', 'To become a BYU student, a prospective student must understand that the university is a private institution operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Most of the students here will be part of the LDS faith. In other words, religion is very much an integral part of the BYU experience. For someone who is not part of the faith, there will be many unfamiliar terms, practices, and traditions. Religious courses are part of the graduation requirement. Some of them are challenging courses, so do not underestimate them. Another important factor to know about BYU is that it does not have a spring break. This because of the way semesters and terms, essentially half-semesters with accelerated courses, make up the academic calendar. There are two semesters in a school year: Fall and Winter. The two terms, Spring and Summer, are not mandatory; therefore, it is possible for students to have a 4-month summer vacation! Freshmen do not have to live on-campus and they can have cars. Social life is mostly based on wards, a congregation in the Church, especially during the first semester. A great way to get into the groove of things is to enter BYU during the Summer Term when things are more relaxed and you can make some friends before your peers who will come in during Fall. Finally, you must comply to the Honor Code if you wish to stay as an eligible student on campus.', 'If you want quality education with low cost, this is the place for you. There are plenty of activities here and the academics are rigorous. Sports events can be the best things around here.']]",Brigham Young University-Provo (BYU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Brigham-Young-University-Provo/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/111345,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,31,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899335731,899140846,HORIZONTAL,"{35181=Starting 2011 Fall semester, BYU is requiring the ACT with Writing for admission.

So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities.

In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum.

If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

I have enjoyed all my classes and professors and have learned a lot so far. I also have met a lot of different people from across the country and have really enjoyed the social atmosphere and activities that provide a break from studies. The campus is beautiful in both summer and winter with a gorgeous view of the mountains to the East, which provide opportunities for skiing, hiking, fishing, camping, tubing, biking, and other outdoor activities. Overall I have highly enjoyed studying at BYU! Am learning a lot The classes at BYU are challenging, and by going to class, doing my homework, taking advantage of student help labs, and meeting with willing and helpful professors I have learned and grown a lot in the three semesters I have been here. There are also a plethora of classes available in every subject area, and I feel like I have been able to build my knowledge in core subject areas as well as explore new subject areas that were not available to me in High School.

The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU).

There are several activities to attend during each semester, but you have to make an effort to go to them in order to enjoy this school like I have.

All through high school I studied really hard and thought that I knew a lot, but once I got to BYU I was introduced to a whole new world of learning. As in all things, the amount of learning comes from each individual. You have to listen carefully to each lecture, you have to read the textbooks and other class materials, you are responsible to ask questions.

Also great for students who are serious about their studies, and want to get the most out of their education. If you still are wondering about this whole LDS nonsense, visit http://www.mormon.org to find out more. It really isn't so bad chilling with a bunch of us."", ""If you are unsure about whether you want to go to BYU, try and visit the campus and attend a forum or devotional. If you're still young enough, see if you can attend EFY here. Also, don't think that the Utah Mormon bubble will have a huge effect on most things. BYU encourages more out-of-state students to attend than in-state, so the majority of LDS students you're dealing with were one of a handful of Mormons at their High School. Not to mention, it's kind of hard to get in (so keep those grades up!) so most of the students are rather intelligent as well."", ""Tuition here is mega cheap!

But that's not all; a person could easily major in all of the social events and clubs here on campus. There are so many things to do, and ways to serve. Also, I'm pretty sure that BYU should be ranked number one in the nation for most attractive people. Seriously, both the women and the men here are just plain beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen so many beautiful people in my life. So anyway, if you have the opportunity to go to BYU, GO! It will change your life. If you're looking for anything other than alcohol, sex, and drugs, then this is the best place to find it.

Luckily, though, the professors are very friendly and willing to help or have teaching assistants who will help you if you are struggling as well."", ""College is just like high school, except you don't get participation points. You have to pay attention to what you are learning in your classes if you expect to do well on assignments and tests. Learn as much as you can about campus and the organizations offered there, because there are so many opportunities at BYU.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B.

In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

I have enjoyed all my classes and professors and have learned a lot so far. I also have met a lot of different people from across the country and have really enjoyed the social atmosphere and activities that provide a break from studies. The campus is beautiful in both summer and winter with a gorgeous view of the mountains to the East, which provide opportunities for skiing, hiking, fishing, camping, tubing, biking, and other outdoor activities. Overall I have highly enjoyed studying at BYU! Am learning a lot The classes at BYU are challenging, and by going to class, doing my homework, taking advantage of student help labs, and meeting with willing and helpful professors I have learned and grown a lot in the three semesters I have been here. There are also a plethora of classes available in every subject area, and I feel like I have been able to build my knowledge in core subject areas as well as explore new subject areas that were not available to me in High School.

Like a cross between heterozygotes, 3/4 the time it is a spiritual topic and the other 1/4 it is an academic topic. Regardless, the talks are amazing and inspiring.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship. Living on-campus is a little pricey compared to the cheapness of tuition, but it's definitely more than worth it! The meal plans are also excellent, and the food at the Canon center is delicious!, 506288=Great education in world-class programs for under $12,000 total cost per year. Tuition is around $2000 for LDS students and $4000 for non-LDS students per semester. The biggest cost is housing., 133179=just about anything you want to do (that doesn't break the honor code) you can! there is a club night with over 150 clubs that meet, so if you want to make friends or practice hobbies or skills, that's the night for you. there are so many events on campus that you don't want to miss, too! also, every tuesday at 11:00 am, all of campus shuts down for a university devotional or forum (depending on which week it is) where a faculty member or esteemed public figure will come and speak to the students. it is a great time to enjoy learning without being held responsible for homework or tests. it also builds campus unity and helps everyone to relax part-way through the week., 806948=every sunday at 10:00 pm, there is tunnel singing in a tunnel by the bell tower, by the marriott center. We sing hymns, and the boys announce their mission calls. Its pretty fun!, 717268=At 5:15 every night the flag is taken down and everyone on campus stops while the national anthem is played., 261114=This is definitely worth the money. Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer. I'm not expecting my parents to pay any of this!, 877909=The cost of a full-time LDS student, per semester, is about $2300 and the cost of a full-time non-LDS student, per semester, is about $4600. Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship. Living on-campus is a little pricey compared to the cheapness of tuition, but it's definitely more than worth it! The meal plans are also excellent, and the food at the Canon center is delicious!, 506288=Great education in world-class programs for under $12,000 total cost per year. Tuition is around $2000 for LDS students and $4000 for non-LDS students per semester. The biggest cost is housing., 133179=just about anything you want to do (that doesn't break the honor code) you can! there is a club night with over 150 clubs that meet, so if you want to make friends or practice hobbies or skills, that's the night for you. there are so many events on campus that you don't want to miss, too! also, every tuesday at 11:00 am, all of campus shuts down for a university devotional or forum (depending on which week it is) where a faculty member or esteemed public figure will come and speak to the students. it is a great time to enjoy learning without being held responsible for homework or tests. it also builds campus unity and helps everyone to relax part-way through the week., 806948=every sunday at 10:00 pm, there is tunnel singing in a tunnel by the bell tower, by the marriott center.

Its pretty fun!, 717268=At 5:15 every night the flag is taken down and everyone on campus stops while the national anthem is played., 261114=This is definitely worth the money. Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer. I'm not expecting my parents to pay any of this!, 877909=The cost of a full-time LDS student, per semester, is about $2300 and the cost of a full-time non-LDS student, per semester, is about $4600. Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}","08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 85 out of 86 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 465 Kathleen from Alpharetta, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I think because a lot of students are so naive, bad things do happen. Girls have been known to be rapped, but quite honestly it is usually at night when they are walking by themselves. BYU has done everything they can to help prevent this including teaching the students, handing out whistles, and they have emergency phones located throughout the campus. Of course other bad things also happen like stealing, but these are rare.', 'There are a lot of clubs available especially associated with the different majors. There also are a lot of activities in Brigham Square.', 'BYU will be your haven if you are serious about getting an education, love the gospel and want to learn more about it, and if you love to be surrounded by amazing people who you can look to for an example.', 'If you are not a member of the LDS church everything will be a little unusual. However, if you are a member it is such a wonderful opportunity to experience Zion. Not all classes but several start with a prayer, there are devotionals almost every Tuesday with professors and General Authorities speaking, and there are lots of campus wide opportunities to serve.', 'If you are an LDS student you automatically pay half tuition because tithing pays for half of it. I have also heard of several professors who donate their salary back to the university. Both these things added together means you are getting an outstanding education for the lowest price possible.', 'There are so many beautiful hikes up Provo Canyon and Rock Canyon. Utah Lake is pretty close, but I do not actually encourage swimming in it. There are two malls that are very close. There are fun activities on campus. And a lot of fun activities through the apartment complexes and wards.', ""There is a large variety of restaurants fast food, and grocery stories right around BYU and in Provo. Some of my favorite places are: the BYU creamery, Sammy's, Maceys, and Buy Low."", 'I did not actually live in the freshman dorms, but I love the housing around BYU! All BYU students are required to live in BYU approved housing. A lot of people think this sounds unfair and like BYU is micro-managing their students life. I was worried about this too at first. However, I soon discovered how nice it is to live in a place where certain standards are expected and enforced. It creates a much safer, cleaner environment without eliminating the chance to have fun and get to know new people.', 'President Samuelson encourages the professors to assign enough reading, studying and homework to equal three hours of homework for every hour in class. I do not think I ever met this actual ratio, but there is a ton of outside work necessary for almost every class. However, all the classes are very passable. I feel like my grades have pretty fairly reflected the effort and time I put into each class.', 'If you want to go here plan on working really hard. BYU only accepts the best, coming from high school where you might have been at the top to a university where you are average can be a difficult adjustment; however, it will push you like never before. Just come ready to work hard and have fun.', 'BYU is full of opportunities to grow academically, emotionally, and spiritually. It is not a college where you can slide by and get your degree. A lot of the classes encourage you to learn skills not only applicable to a certain major but also to life.']]",Brigham Young University-Provo (BYU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Brigham-Young-University-Provo/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/111345,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,170,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899335731,899140846,HORIZONTAL,"{35181=Starting 2011 Fall semester, BYU is requiring the ACT with Writing for admission.

There are activities through the year to help students meet more people and stay social."", 'BYU is an extremely competitive school depending on which programs you apply for. Keep in mind that there are students here that turned down schools like Yale and Stanford to come here (Mostly for tuition and standard reasons). Students here are expected to be dedicated and apply themselves to schooling.', 'Make sure that you do a lot of extracurricular activities, and try your best to push yourself and take leadership opportunities.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities.

Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus.

There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum.

When this happens, the Star-Spangled Banner is played throughout the campus and people stop and turn in the flagpole's direction with a salute to the flag in some way until the anthem ceases. Another tradition is that of lighting the Y. The Y is a large, concrete letter Y that was placed on the mountain that the university is located under.

The rigor of the classes is exceptional, but the challenge brings with it much more learning than you would have ever hoped to get in high school. The acceptance standards for this university are extremely high, and it reflects in the coursework; every student here was at the top of his or her graduating class in high school, so everyone is used to getting A's at a high school level, which means an A is actually equivalent to a C here.

You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's.

If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU).

"[['Categories', 'Campus Safety', 'Greek Life', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', 'BYU campus in most areas is very safe. Obviously, walking alone at night is not a smart thing to do, even at BYU. Many girls have been raped over the years at BYU because they were jogging or walking in the dark alone. There are bikes that on occasion are stolen, but the Police force at BYU are pretty good about', 'BYU is a predominant LDS school. There is absolutely no Greek life on BYU campus. They are not allowed at BYU, and although some might think that is odd, it takes away the party school feeling at BYU and shows that is does have unique standards.', 'BYU is a University with more than 30,000 students. There is something going on everyday while at BYU. There are probably hundreds of clubs at BYUÃƒÂ¢??and anyone can get involved. The student association has free food on certain days, activities outside and opportunities for students to serve. Not only are there clubs, but there are Foreign films, dollar movies and other shows that are put on every week at BYU. With BYUÃƒÂ¢??s prestigious music program, there are concerts and plays that are always going on. The Athletic part of BYU campus is a major part of the fun that you can participate in. BYU students can enroll and play in Intramural sports throughout the school year and the BYU sports teams are very well known for their success. The LaVell Edwards Football Stadium holds more than 35,000 people and the fans love the competitive games. Along with football, there is basketball, baseball, tennis, volleyball, rugby and numerous other sports. If a student thinks BYU is boring, it is because they are not trying to be a part of the school and take advantage of all of the fun things that it offers.', 'Brigham Young University offers a variety of food and dining. The BYU Creamery is known very well for its delicious ice cream and pastries. One cannot go to BYU and leave without getting a scoop of ice cream or a mint brownie. The Cougareat is the food court in the WilkinsonÃƒÂ¢??s Student Center and has a variety of shops to appease all appetites. From fast food (Italian, Mexican, Sandwiches, Sweets and grocery shops) to delicious homemade food, BYU serves its best and provides a great opportunity for students, alumni, and visitors. Around BYU, are also little food shops started by students that create a wonderful innovative atmosphere and delicious food for everyone to eat.', 'The Dorm Life at BYU is very fun and especially great for incoming Freshman. Helaman and Heritage Halls offer a wonderful experience close to BYU where students can feel more connected to the University. Activities are always happening around campus and also in the dorms. Barbecues, dances, movie nights and other activities have been some of the dorm activities from this last year. Being a part of BYU Dorm life allows the students to become more familiar with things going on at school and allows for a very fun social life.', 'BYU is not a simple University where one can get by with the minimum amount of work and still get an A in the class. BYU offers challenging classes that require time and effort for the students to achieve good grades. Professors are all individually different, and looking for the teachers ratings on certain websites is a great way to thin out which professors or classes you would prefer. As finals begin to approach, donÃƒÂ¢??t slack off in your studies; stay on top of things. Finals Weeks for me have been the most stressful part of my BYU experience, but if I was not prepared, it would have been much worse. One has to manage time wisely and study several hours a week. Although BYUÃƒÂ¢??s classes are challenging, staying on top of your homework and reading ahead is very helpful and pays off in the end.', 'Honestly, when you are a student at BYU you cannot slack or think that your grades will all just work out in the end. It takes a lot of hard work and time set aside to study your material to do well at BYU. Getting to know your professors and creating study groups in classes is important in your academic success. The hardest part of going to college for me was learning how to manage my time. There are lots of fun and exciting things to participate in while at BYU, but as a student, one has to remember that education comes first. It is very easy to get bogged down with your stressful classes, but if you take time each day to do something relaxing for you, whether it is hanging out with friends, or reading a book you enjoy. You can have a great experience at BYU and do well academically and socially.', 'Brigham Young University offers a challenge for students to explore their potential and make a difference in the world if they choose to do so. Although BYU might be a tough learning experience for most, the opportunities available for students to grow and expand their development are numerous. With a beautiful campus, excellent teachers and a standard for excellence, BYU is a prestigious school that allows its students to learn, grow and graduate with a great education.']]",Brigham Young University-Provo (BYU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Brigham-Young-University-Provo/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/111345,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,205,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899335731,899140846,HORIZONTAL,"{35181=Starting 2011 Fall semester, BYU is requiring the ACT with Writing for admission.

The other set of dorms is known as Helaman Halls and these are your standard type of dorms. They are three-story buildings of rooms, two wings for each floor, and have a basement with a laundry room, kitchen, and musical practice rooms which can also be used as quiet study rooms. The floors have shared and single bedrooms; and each wing (2 wings per floor) shares a bathroom with seven shower stalls, three toilet stalls, three sinks, and (for boys) three urinals. Both sets of dorms have multiple buildings which separate boys from the girls. In order to get everybody to know each other, different floors of the male buildings are combined with other floors of female buildings and those compose units of usually around 100 students called a ward. That set of people are the people you go to church with every Sunday and plan activities with because everybody is assigned a different position or calling in the ward. Then, to make groups even more compact, there are groups in each ward called your family or family home evening group and that is usually consistent of about 10 people.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship. Living on-campus is a little pricey compared to the cheapness of tuition, but it's definitely more than worth it! The meal plans are also excellent, and the food at the Canon center is delicious!, 506288=Great education in world-class programs for under $12,000 total cost per year. Tuition is around $2000 for LDS students and $4000 for non-LDS students per semester. The biggest cost is housing., 133179=just about anything you want to do (that doesn't break the honor code) you can! there is a club night with over 150 clubs that meet, so if you want to make friends or practice hobbies or skills, that's the night for you. there are so many events on campus that you don't want to miss, too! also, every tuesday at 11:00 am, all of campus shuts down for a university devotional or forum (depending on which week it is) where a faculty member or esteemed public figure will come and speak to the students. it is a great time to enjoy learning without being held responsible for homework or tests. it also builds campus unity and helps everyone to relax part-way through the week., 806948=every sunday at 10:00 pm, there is tunnel singing in a tunnel by the bell tower, by the marriott center.

Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer. I'm not expecting my parents to pay any of this!, 877909=The cost of a full-time LDS student, per semester, is about $2300 and the cost of a full-time non-LDS student, per semester, is about $4600. Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}","08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 85 out of 86 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 465 Kathleen from Alpharetta, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It's not hard to find a game somewhere to join of any sport, intramurals are huge there, and there are hundreds of clubs and organizations to join. The fine arts center has several practice rooms for anyone to use, there are computers all over campus, the student center has bowling and several different activities going on. The student association club puts on dances and other great things to do. The foreign language clubs do activities, the Italian club for example puts on Il Palio every year which is a blast to watch and there is food.

The Canon Center has delicious food, and also on campus there are several options, like Subway, Jamba Juice, Chinese, pizza, Italian, several different restaurants, and the BYU Creamery. The Creamery is amazing. While the groceries are a bit pricey, they make up for it with their milk and ice cream.

You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's.

The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU).

The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's.

If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU).

If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

The campus is beautiful in both summer and winter with a gorgeous view of the mountains to the East, which provide opportunities for skiing, hiking, fishing, camping, tubing, biking, and other outdoor activities. Overall I have highly enjoyed studying at BYU! Am learning a lot The classes at BYU are challenging, and by going to class, doing my homework, taking advantage of student help labs, and meeting with willing and helpful professors I have learned and grown a lot in the three semesters I have been here. There are also a plethora of classes available in every subject area, and I feel like I have been able to build my knowledge in core subject areas as well as explore new subject areas that were not available to me in High School.

You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's.

If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU).

The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities.

I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

Students are respectful of other students and their property. If girls are walking home at night, it isn't the best idea to go alone, but never worry, there is always a guy you know who would love to walk you home!"", ""One of the interesting aspects of BYU is there is no Greek life, no frats, no sororities. Instead, you become close with people that live in your dorm or apartment complex through church activities. If you're worried about missing out on Greek Life, I can assure you that the social life here is even better."", ""There are so many clubs and activities that there is something here for everyone!

The more involved you can be, the more fun you'll have."", 'Students who want to learn succeed beyond measure here. There are so many opportunities to learn so much, especially through the Honors Program. This is definitely a place where students get what they put into their education.', 'Tuition here is incredibly low, which makes this a completely affordable place to go. However, the education is not low-quality: in fact, BYU is a highly esteemed college. It looks great on job applications to have a degree from BYU!', ""There are always dances on the weekends somewhere. They're free too! The dollar theater is pretty close (for those that have a car), but the Varsity Theater also shows movies sometimes. There's tons of music and theater performances, as well as sports games. Football is a big deal here; everyone has lots of school spirit! You can also hike the Y or go hiking on one of the many trails into the mountains just east of campus."", 'On and off campus, there is a huge selection of places to eat. For those in the dorms, the Cannon Center makes a huge variety of delicious foods--both healthy ones and desserts. It can get a little crowded, but there are so many other options that you can always find any type of food somewhere else.', ""While I never lived in the dorms, everything I hear about them is great! I also have spent plenty of times in the dorms with friends. The rooms are comfortable and it's a great way to make friends. The dorm bathrooms and lounge area are frequently cleaned, which makes it an all around great place to live. Off-campus is fantastic too! Once you live in the dorms freshman year, get a group of your buddies together and pick apartments off-campus. You won't regret it."", 'The classes here are challenging, but the wonderful professors make it totally manageable! After class you walk away feeling like it was time well-spent and that you learned a lot.', ""Get involved! There is so much going on all the time, especially with service. It's a great way to meet people and make friends. Take advantage of all the free activities and stuff that is handed out! No one in college has lots of money, and BYU constantly has events that are little to no cost. Prepare now, because BYU is increasingly competitive to be accepted to, but is more than worth the effort."", ""BYU is amazing!

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities.

In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class.

This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April.

If you like music, MUSE cafe or Sammys offer concerts that really cheap or free. If you like to dance, there are free dance parties with food and glow sticks every weekend. There are football games, basketball games, volleyball games. Several start up theatre companies are constantly producing new shows.

If you are pre-med or pre-dental it is a wonderful place to be. The rigor of your course work prepares you well for professional school and the MCAT and DAT."", ""Value your education. As a private school, every BYU student, whether they are religious or not, is subsidized by the funding of LDS church members all over the world. Considering it takes a billion dollars to run BYU every year and students only pay a million in tuition, that is a big difference. In every class I have I often think to myself, there is someone out there that truly believes my education is important and is willing to fund it even though they do not even know me. This is humbling. Value the experiences you are being given. Value knowledge. And as you go out in the world, give back. Find ways to inspire and uplift those around you. Find opportunities to help others with your knowledge. Opportunities don't materialize out of no where. We make them for each other. So use your time wisely."", 'Home of the cougar and land of the sober, BYU is the place where greatest is made.

At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship.

Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}","08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 85 out of 86 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 465 Kathleen from Alpharetta, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}","08/05/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 85 out of 86 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 465 Kathleen from Alpharetta, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

This is not any easy school and education should not be taken lightly. The pre-med and engineering have a reputation of being the most difficult tracks to follow. However, as a student in the college of Arts and Sciences and the Business School, I can assure you that there aren't many joke classes. Students interested in changing the world or entrepreneurship will also find support here. We have an entrepreneurship center that helps small businesses start and puts students in touch with professionals in the St. Louis community. We also have many advocacy, charity and community service organizations that help people in our local community as well as around the world. This is a great school for students seeking to expand their knowledge and become more open minded. With student-run political groups, a plethora of cultural associations and students from all over the world, you'll always have opportunities to learn something new as well as share your culture with others."", ""Be original in your application. Many of the students here have quirks that make them unique. Some students backpacked through India and other parts of Asia. Others are interested in coal-reform and green energy. I have a friend who's really into swing dancing. Though you need a high, competitive high school GPA as well as good test scores, your essay and choice of extracurriculars are two avenues through which you can express both your personality and individuality. Cookie-cutter students need not apply. If you're looking for a group of accomplished, competitive students without the stress that you'll see at East Coast Schools, this is your next best alternative. Since we're in the Midwest, time seems to slow down and people tend to be more relaxed."", 'Sometimes I wonder where my tuition money is going. Then I noticed that the housekeeping lady cleaned my bathroom already this week. We have cleaning services two times a week which is extremely beneficial given the rigor of our classes and the fact that they do a great job. There are also subsidized events and enough money to fund numerous student activities as well as our own campus radio. However, I could do without the housecleaning and faulty internet connection if that meant paying less than $10,000 a year for housing. I think the amount of tuition that we pay is fine since the caliber of professors teaching is very high. Also, though we have highly ranked dining services, $4,000 for 9 months worth of food is too much. In fact, if meal points were real money, I would not buy anything. I feel that we could get the same services for a slightly lower bill.', ""Coming from Atlanta to St. Louis was a bit of a transition. Though already used to the humid summers, I wasn't sure of what to expect with having a roommate, sharing a bathroom or eating three meals a day on campus. Luckily, Bon Apetit, our source of dining services is also ranked as one of the best in the nation. I know many of the chefs by name and have many favorites. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food is, people need a change. There is a Subway on campus and a near-by Domino's. The Loop, a street filled with fun shops and restaurants, is in walking distance from the school and has a Ben & Jerry's which delivers. The housing application is somewhat chaotic during your freshman year. We have a lottery system and there are three rounds. Each applicant is assigned a random number and the average of his number and those of his chosen future roommates will be averaged. All dorms have Residential College Directors and most undergraduate dorms have Residential Advisors. Both leaders foster a sense of school spirit among residents and often get subsidized tickets for events in St. Louis such as The Nutcracker at the Fox or a St. Louis Rams game at the Edward Jones Dome. Wash U athletics are Division 3 meaning that you shouldn't expect a packed game. However, our athletes do extremely well in and we have more than enough trophies, framed jerseys and memorabilia to prove it. Over all St. Louis is an ok city. Though there are many places I would not go to at night, there are lots of restaurants and shops that I do go to. I did not give this five stars because I miss the big city feel, would prefer a less complicated housing system and would have enjoyed Division 1 Athletics."", 'Given that this is a top private university in the States, only the best professors and educators are hired to lecture at the school. Outside of the classroom, many research based major programs allow you to attend seminars, symposiums and events to learn about research in that discipline. Inside the classroom students are able to learn from a range of very qualified professors, all highly enthusiastic about the subject that they teach. I love knowing that my economics professor uses the concepts we learn in class to explain her reasoning to her kids. My anthropology professor often showed pictures from his research in Mexico to aid with our discussions on culture and the environment. Furthermore, I enjoy knowing that my accounting professor was a former CFO and that my statistics professor likes card games and roulette. Their enthusiasm combined with a plethora of research centers in many disciplines allows me to learn as much as I choose and constantly ask questions.']]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,3,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun!

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', 'Washington University is great for students who are seriously committed to academics and willing to work hard to succeed. The atmosphere is generally laidback and there are many opportunities for fun, but Ã¢\x80\x9cgood gradesÃ¢\x80? will not be handed out free. A strong work ethic and a desire to learn are essential. Additionally, the university consists of a very diverse community, so potential students should be willing to have an open mind about things they may have never been exposed to before.', 'The admissions process is competitive but by no means impossible. Obviously, things like a strong academic record, high standardized test scores, and an exceptional application essay are important; unfortunately, as with many selective universities, they do not necessarily guarantee acceptance. One way to stand out in a talented group of applicants is to demonstrate an ability to succeed in a college setting. With opportunities like the High School Summer Scholars Program, Washington University offers potential students the chance not only to show that they can handle Washington University coursework but also to earn college credit. While getting involved in the college scene during high school may not assure acceptance, I think it certainly gives students a competitive advantage. Another important point is that Washington University has something of a reputation for placing many applicants on a waitlist. From what I know about it, the number of studentsÃ¢\x80\x94if anyÃ¢\x80\x94who are accepted off the waitlist varies from year to year, so there is no way to really tell what your chances are. If you are offered the chance to be placed on the waitlist and are still interested in attending Washington University, accept the waitlist position, but make sure you have a backup plan.', 'Washington University has a reputation for being quite expensive, and it is. The good news, however, is that Student Financial Services is exceptionally helpful, so do not let fiscal concerns keep you from applying. Washington University works very hard to ensure that those who are accepted can attend if they so chooseÃ¢\x80\x94regardless of their familyÃ¢\x80\x99s financial situation. If your family is very wealthy, chances are they will have to pay a total of over $200,000, but you will receive a high-quality education from a well-respected university. On the other hand, if you come from a lower or middle-class family, you can receive that same education for a price that is more suited to your familyÃ¢\x80\x99s circumstances. Granted, you may need to work a part-time job as part of the Federal Work-Study Program, or you may need to look for a few outside scholarships, but overall, Washington University does a good job of making a great education a reality for just about anyone who is accepted.', 'While the classes are certainly challenging, I love being at Washington University. The community is very close-knit; despite being located in the city of St. Louis, the main campus is a beautiful, park-like oasis, set off from the surrounding metropolis in what is commonly referred to as the Ã¢\x80\x9cWashU Bubble.Ã¢\x80? Freshmen and some upperclassmen live together on a forty-acre plot of land known as the Ã¢\x80\x9cSouth 40,Ã¢\x80? which is adjacent to the main campus and consists of residential buildings as well as a variety of places to eat, study, relax, and socialize. All facilities that I have seen, both on the South 40 and on the main campus, are very nice and are well maintained. Moreover, the people are generally accepting and friendly, and even though the academics are competitive, students usually try to help each other succeed rather than to cut each other down.', 'The classes here can be quite demanding; however, in the end, the hard work is worth it. While for the majority of students, long hours of studying are probably necessary to succeed, Washington University assists with the learning process by offering a plethora of academic resources, such as free tutoring and academic mentoring for (almost) any class. In addition, many of the professors have a lot of knowledge to impart, as they are true experts in their field.

When it was almost time for my second calculus exam, she knocked on my door and handed it to me without me even asking. And.. we didn't know each other that well. So the bottom line is, you'll not feel pressured or depressed here, because there are always people that'll help you out. One thing I don't really like is that when Asians go to a white party, they tend to be not welcomed. But maybe it was just that few white students that are like that."", ""I'm currently a freshman in the Olin business school and from what I've encountered, the professors here are great! Their lectures are pretty entertaining and informative at the same time. If you don't get something in class, always go to their office hours. They are very approachable WILL help you out.

There is a network of campus police constantly patrolling the campus in their vehicles at night to keep an eye out for mischief. There are also emergency lights scattered everywhere on campus, which have a button you can press if you ever feel in danger, and a cop will be there within a minute. Although I've never heard of any student ever needing to use those."", ""I was a part of the women's basketball program there last year, and it was an experience I will never forget. Even though the football culture there is not big, the basketball culture certainly is: the women's and men's teams are both very successful, with the women's team winning four or five national championships in a row in the past decade. A wide variety of religious clubs and other organizations appeal to all students."", ""Students who were raised in a rather sheltered community would do well to attend here because it would greatly expand their ideas about the world. People from all backgrounds go to Wash U, and it is so beneficial to learn other people's stories in order to enhance yours for the future. Also, it is a great place for students with a wide variety of interests, because all of Wash U's fields of study are so critically acclaimed that, whichever major you choose in the end, you will find success in it."", ""While Wash U is an extremely expensive school, they are very generous with their financial aid: almost everyone I know received some sort of financial help, whether it was a partial scholarship, a two-thirds scholarship (what I received), or full tuition scholarship. More importantly, the things you get to experience at Wash U are worth the money: I learned so much about different cultures and interests by going to this institution, since I was surrounded by people who weren't all like me. Moreover, all of the things I listed above, like the dorm life and the quality of food, further support my belief that Wash U has great bang for its buck."", ""I mentioned the Loop above: students often go there on Friday or Saturday nights to enjoy a night out at a restaurant with their friends, or for a treat at Fro Yo. In addition, students often attend Cardinals games in the fall and spring at Busch Stadium. Next to campus is also Forest Park, which holds the St. Louis Art Museum and the St. Louis Zoo. I've heard the Botanical Gardens are a must-see, as well as, of course, the St. Louis Arch. Lastly, a ten to fifteen minute ride on the MetroLink train will get you to the Galleria, a huge mall with all of the stores you could possibly want, as well as chain restaurants, like Maggiano's, PF Changs, Cheesecake Factory, Five Guys, and Panera (and there's a food court inside)."", ""Wash U was recently ranked the nation's top university for food lovers by the Daily Meal. It has a wide variety of places to choose from on-campus to eat, and each of those places offers a vast assortment of types of food to choose from: Italian, American, Mexican, Greek, Asian, Indian, as well as Kosher food, sandwich and wrap stations, several coffee and pastry bakeries, and a miniature grocery store. Off campus, there are a few wonderful cafes nearby, and a 15-minute walk will get you to The Loop, which has a variety of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Noodles, Panera, Ben and Jerrys, etc.) and local ones, including a delicious Fro Yo place."", 'You only have to visit Wash U to know why I chose to give the dorms 5 stars. Apparently, our dorms are ranked second in the country. Of course, there are some older dorms, but most of the freshman dorms are very comfortable, especially the modern style. As a big fan of modern style, I highly recommend choosing it, because a housekeeper cleans your bathroom twice a week, you get tempur-pedic mattresses, the closet is huge (for all of you clothing-lovers) and the room itself was bigger than my bedroom at home.', 'Just like any other college, of course, you can enroll in all easy classes and achieve a 4.0 without doing much work. But the kind of students that attend Wash U are not the kind that look for the easy way out. Students always load up their class schedule in order to explore all different kinds of subjects; for example, an art student took an architecture studio--one of the most demanding courses at Wash U--as an elective because she was interested in it and thought it would be fun.', ""Make sure you don't spend your entire freshman year in the library. The people I've met at Wash U are some of the nicest, most welcoming people I've ever encountered, and it would be a shame for you not to escape the confines of your favorite study space and experience college the way it's meant to be experienced. Finally, don't be afraid to explore all of your interests: Wash U offers so many opportunities for you to do this, and after all, college is really the only time for you to try everything to figure out what you really love."", ""Wash U, as it is called, offers students unique opportunities that, I believe, no other college can. It truly has an international, or a global, community: you get to interact with some of the best minds from across the nation, as well as outside of the U.S. (some international students on my freshman year floor were from Paraguay, China, and Japan). Lastly, Wash U is known to its students as the U.S.'s best-kept secret, for Wash U is certainly on or near the level of Ivy League Colleges and well-known universities--such as Duke, Vanderbilt, and Notre Dame--but is far less well-known, making it a hot-spot for the diverse and creative minds who are more interested in the process of learning itself than on the perks and superficial bonuses that may come with attending a more well-known university.""]]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,9,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun!

I guess an interesting thing is that they have hammocks all over the place, and there's a swing set on campus(!)."", ""I feel like the money is worth going to a school like Washington University in St. Louis. You get a quality education, a nice place to rest your head, and an environment that's very active. Also, while you do pay a lot to go to Wash. U., they give it back to the students. For example, there's a fund set aside for new clubs or organizations. There are tons of scholarships for incoming freshmen and research students. The U-pass is included in the tuition, which basically means that students get to take the metro for free during the school year if they have their pass on them. Basically, it's worth it."", ""There's an outdoor pool. Unfortunately, it isn't very deep, but it's still a cool place to hang out or have barbecues with your friends. There's a game room on the second floor of the DUC with a pretty nice TV, a pool table, and a Foosball table. Also, a lot of the dorms will have board and/or card games all over the place. Walking to the Loop is always pretty fun when you're with friends. I'm sure there's a lot more to do during the fall and spring semesters, but I was only there for the summer, so I can't really think of anything else to do for fun on campus. However, the metro isn't far at all from the South 40--10 minute walk--and it'll take you all over St. Louis."", ""The food is really delicious. There are tons of places to eat on campus, and there is a large variety of food. There's a pizza station, the wok (which is the area for Asian cuisine), comfort food station (which is where you can find anything from Jamaican jerk chicken to spaghetti on any given day), a burger/chicken strip area, and Delicioso (which is where the Mexican cuisine is found). And all of that stuff is just in the DUC. Then you have Holmes Lounge, Ursas, Bears Den, and tons of other places on campus to eat. It's kind of mind-blowing. Also, the Loop, which is a 10 to 15 minute walk from the residential area of campus, has tons of dining options, some of which accept Bear Bucks."", ""During the five-week summer program, I stayed in a traditional, and I can guarantee that it's better than some dorms on other campuses. The dorms are all pretty spacious, but I saw a modern dorm during my visit, and it looks like a hotel suite. It isn't necessarily as fancy, but the layout is very similar to that of hotel suites. It's worth the cost of room and board for sure."", 'The summer classes I took were pretty easy, but they were literature and writing classes, which are more opinion- and discussion-based. If you take a science or math course, prepare to be challenged. Calculus I and Chemistry were offered as summer courses, and I had friends who took those classes; they did homework together and talked through problems because they were just that difficult. Also, those two classes had sessions during the evening sometimes as well, and it was apparently very necessary because my friends went to all of the evening sessions.', ""Washington University is difficult to get into but not impossible. Maintain contact with the college representative for your state or region, and visit if you can. There will be a lot of students with high GPAs and great test scores, but if you communicate with the representatives as much as you can, they will see that you're genuinely interested, and it will distinguish you from all the other applicants. Also, colleges like to see what you can contribute to their institution, so in your application try to highlight things that make you unique. Don't necessarily say, This is what I can do for your school, but do show them that you bring something different to the table."", 'Washington University is the perfect place for people who want a fancy setting with laid-back people. The classes vary from pretty easy (as long as you do the work) to rigorous, but there is a lot of help from teachers, Cornerstone, and the Writing Center. The administration is welcoming and present; for example, I saw the dean of my college at least five times during the five weeks I was there.']]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,22,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun!

Off campus there are a couple places that aren't very safe after dark, but WUPD makes sure that the campus is very safe."", ""Greek life is pretty prominent at WashU, but doesn't really dominate the social scene in any way. There are a bunch of fraternities, both on and off campus, and a fair percentage of the student body joins them."", ""I've mentioned a lot of these above but there are hundreds of clubs from classic ones like Model United Nations to more niche clubs like beekeeping. There are groups here for everybody, and all the clubs that I know about are very welcoming to new students and active involvement can very easily lead to a leadership position in the club."", ""To be brief there aren't any typical kids but most of the student body promotes a collaborative environment, and everyone works really hard to make sure that they do the best they can. Almost all WashU students are involved in some type of club/non academic activity and the social scene is pretty lively when the weekend comes around."", ""This is an expensive school, no doubt about it. With tuition clocking in at around 56,000 $/year, it is a substantial investment to go to this school, and both parents and future applicants should be aware of that. That being said, WashU gives close to 50% of its students financial aid, and there are a lot of scholarships that you can apply for along with the general application and it's probably a great idea to do so. It should also be noted that WashU is one of the best schools in the country, so employers and grad-schools alike know how rigorous the school is, and how much the degree is worth. Research opportunities are easy to come by as are on-campus jobs, so there are a lot of ways to earn money on campus. Overall, WashU is in my opinion worth the investment - but it is an expensive school."", ""There are many things that could be listed here: clubs, Greek life, intramural sports, parties. public speakers etc. etc. All of these are great ways to make new friends and have a really good time on campus, and the ones you put time into will be the ones you feel closest too. In all honesty, after schoolwork and midterms and the whole scene just relaxing with friends, whether it's playing some soccer/video games or even just going to dinner is a lot of fun, and it's there that I feel the college experience comes together as a whole. Also, make sure to check out the Loop off campus. It's a great place to start exploration of the city."", ""The food at WashU may be my favorite non-social part of campus life. As a freshman/sophomore Bear's Den (BD) will be the eatery of choice and it has a multitude of cuisines including but not limited to: stir fry, grill, Kosher station, make your own sandwich, grill, Indian food, Mexican food and many more. It also has a small grocery store (Paws n Go) as an alternative and a way to stock up for the dorm. There a bunch of other niche places to eat on campus, including Holme's Lounge (wraps), Einstein's (bagels/coffee) and Stanley's (sandwiches). Overall, the food at WashU is really good, and the main cafeteria's like BD have late hours for a late dinner or midnight snack."", 'The dorm life is, in a word, fantastic. Both types of dorms, modern and traditional have their own distinct advantages and cater to different types of students. Traditional dorms are reminiscent of classic college movies with shared bathrooms and an very tight floor bonding. As someone who was in a traditional dorm my first year, all of my suitemates and many of my closest friends came from my floor which is more rare in the modern dorms. The modern dorms are incredible in their own right with elevators, beautiful flooring/furnishings, and private bathrooms and common rooms. Both types of dorms are very well maintained by the Residential Life association.', ""This is a top institution, and anyone considering coming here should know that WashU will push your intellectual limits from day 1. A staggeringpercentage of this school (like all the top schools) hails from the top 5-10% of their high school class, so the kids you'll be going to class with are all very smart kids. The professors dole out difficult tests that will require a good deal of study and many classes will have weekly homework assignments. I know that many students come into WashU as premeds because of the strength of the science departments, and as a premed myself I can attest that while the courses are indeed difficult, if you don't let them get ahead of you, it is definitely manageable. (ALSO: GO TO CLASS). It's also good to remember that nearly every department, from English to Political Science, ranks among the top in the nation."", ""I feel like this lends itself best to a list format, so here goes: -Be ready for a jump in difficulty, not only are all colleges a lot harder than high school, WashU is known for its challenging subject matter. -Get involved in campus life/clubs! They are a fantastic way to meet new people on campus who have similar interests to you, and some will become friends who you'll stick with through college. -Meet the professors. I was slow on this one, but that doesn't mean that anyone else should be. Every class in WashU is taught by a professor (no TA's) and they're all experts in their respective fields. Talking to them will give you a chance for a letter of recommendation later on or even a job/research! Most of all, they're fascinating people who'll give you great insight into their subject. -GO THROUGH ST. LOUIS. In all honesty it doesn't have the wide appeal of a city like Boston, but it has some great digs that anyone and everyone should check out (Pappy's first though - ribs that good are hard to come by)."", 'Washington University, called WashU by most of the students, is an incredible academic institution that takes pride in its strong departments across the board and heavy academic rigor, and a student body that values cooperation over competition. The social scene is very open, and WashU has several clubs for sports like soccer and basketball, and more niche clubs like Model United Nations and an Anime and Manga club (both are pretty awesome). Student life is among the best in the country with top ten rankings for both food and dorms, and the campus has beautiful Gothic architecture.']]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,23,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun!

The campus has been designed to be very well lit at night, and there is a constant patrol of campus police along with the police from the surrounding cities of Clayton and University City. Personally I have walked alone at night many times and never felt at risk or in danger. WashU does a wonderful job of making sure students are aware of the risks and dangers that may occur in a large city such as Saint Louis, but I have personally never felt that WashU's campus itself is anything but safe."", 'Although Greek life plays a lesser role here at WashU than our southern counterparts, roughly 30-35% of WashU students participate in Greek life in some way. They offer a community where you can meet upperclassmen or lowerclassmen and foster a sense of friendship, provide leadership opportunities, and perform service work in the community. You never feel heavily pressured to become apart of Greek life, and deferred rush (rush in the spring semester) allows you to have time to figure out whether Greek Life is right for you.', 'The Activities Fair here at WashU is by far the most overwhelming sight on campus. Every organization sets up in Brookings Quad vying for your attention and participation. From language clubs, to cultural clubs, to business fraternities, to medical associations, to service organizations, to athletics such as fencing or mountain climbing/hiking, political or religious or major affiliated clubs, your choices are vast. Here at WashU you will find your niche. The only problem will be forcing yourself to take a step back, evaluate the situation, and not over commit yourself.', 'As long as you love to learn and are not afraid of hard work, WashU is the place for you. Here you will be challenged, but WashU wants you to succeed. WashU is not an overly competitive campus; others students want to see you succeed just as much as you do. Students who are passionate about their education and are searching for a place which fosters learning in multiple disciplines should look no further than WashU.', ""During the Winter our campus statue called The Bunny is dressed in a lovely sweater of the students' creation. The Butterfly Garden in-between the international House and Music school is a lovely place to go and relax with a book after classes or during the weekend during the warmer days in fall. The Underpass connecting The South 40 (freshman and sophomore housing) to Main Campus is also home to many advertisement boards which are repainted weekly by various clubs advertising events, promoting ideas, or encouraging involvement."", ""Here at WashU, you can't go wrong. Although tuition is costly, WashU provides many opportunities for success and many connections within and outside of the St. Louis area. Here you will be challenged academically and discover that you are much more capable than you every thought, and the emphasis on community involvement helps you find out what you are truly passionate about. Overall, you will open so many more doors for yourself by attending WashU, which I suppose is what you are paying for in the end."", ""Ten minutes down the road is Delmar Boulevard, loving known as The Loop.

Also WashU provides metro passes to the students allowing for fun trips to the Mall, downtown to Busch Stadium for a baseball game, or to Central West End for some exploration."", 'WashU is constantly ranked among the top 3 universities for best dining, and it is no joke. The dining service has a variety of options and accommodates many types of dietary restrictions and choices such as veganism, vegetarianism, kosher, and gluten free. The use of meal points instead of designated meal times or the two-three meals a day plan allows students more freedom with when and what they eat. And since the food is so amazing many students find themselves running out of meal points from eating so much.', ""I have never heard anyone complain about the dorms here at WashU. I currently live in the traditional dorms, and even they are much nicer than many other college campus' modern dorms. Floors can be very welcoming, and they quickly become smilier to a small family. Residential Advisors (RA's) live on the floor with you and help guide you through the first year of college, and afterwards are great resources for campus information and to just simply talk to. Overall very welcoming and very satisfactory."", 'As the Ivy League of the West, according to some of us students, no one will challenge you more than Washington. However they will do everything they can to offer you opportunities to be prepared and to excel in the courses. Help sessions, tutoring groups, residential peer mentors, and numerous other resources help you to adjust to the academic rigor and fully comprehend material.', ""The first tests will be rough. It takes time to become used to how to properly study and prepare yourself for a college exam at a rigorous university. However, there are numerous options for help, and teachers are always very open to aid during their office hours or help sessions. Don't be afraid to call home either. Homesickness is an integral part of the first few weeks of college, and everybody feels it even if they act as if they don't."", ""Overall it's a wonderful place to explore what you truly wish to study and pursue as a degree. The environment balances academics and having fun very well; you never feel the need to choose between the two. Also you can't go wrong at WashU; they are strong in every field of study from Business to Engineering to the Arts.""]]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,29,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun!

Although students are extremely serious about grades and spend hours studying in the library, Washington University's students are also very social.

Most students do find a group to participate in, which is a great way to meet other students and make friends. In general, students are pretty friendly and intelligent. St. Louis is also a surprisingly fun city to be in, with plenty of interesting places, like the City Museum, to investigate.

St. Louis is a crime-heavy city but Wash U is definitely not in the hub of that.', ""It's there, but definitely not pervasive if that's not your thing."", 'A large variety for all different interests.', ""Although there's almost no denying that the quality of education at Wash U is top-notch, I sometimes question if a cheaper school would have been better. It all depends on what you want to do. If you have no interest in research or going really far places in your field, I would consider going to a different institution. That said, I have had an overall pleasurable experience here."", ""There's always something going on on campus. Greek life is definitely there but also not overbearing if you aren't interested in it. There are plenty of clubs that span a large variety of interests. Forest Park is a short trip away, there are plenty of good restaurants around, and you can find just about anything else with the free metro pass they provide you with.. Wash U has a pretty relaxed alcohol policy, but I chose to live in substance-free housing and didn't have any problems with noise or anything, so that's definitely an option if partying isn't your thing."", ""You can get pretty much any kind of food you want, and it's all delicious. There's a pasta station, stir fry station, Mexican food station, burger grill, and pizza stand all in the same place. There are also kosher and vegetarian options, as well as a grocery store. I was able to go two weeks without eating the same thing for a meal, and I enjoyed everything I ate. It's all cooked to order, so freshness is also a plus."", ""The dorms on campus, even the older, traditional housing, are amazing. Each room comes with a Tempur-Pedic mattress, dresser, desk, and chair. The rooms aren't huge but are bigger than most other college dorms; I never had problems with a lack of room for things. Staff clean common rooms and bathrooms and have been super friendly to me. The only real complaint is that it's about a fifteen minute walk to campus, twenty with some of the further dorms."", ""Wash U is hard, but you learn a lot. The professors make sure that you truly understand a subject and don't just memorize test answers. There are also a multitude of academic resources available if you begin to struggle, including professors, who will always find time to talk to you if you need to. If it's knowledge you seek, Wash U is about the best way to provide that."", ""Look carefully at what you want to do and the reasons you want to do it. If you seek a top-notch education to be able to explore your deep, personal passions and interests, Wash U is for you. If you're just looking for a degree, which there's nothing wrong with, you can get the same thing at other institutions for a much cheaper price in most fields. Wash U is hard, so be prepared to take on a heavier workload, especially if you come from a laid back, non-competitive high school like I did. However, you'll walk away feeling like you truly learned something, and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing."", ""The quality of education I have received at Washington University has been amazing, which I assume is why most people consider Wash U. The faculty there have done real research and are experts in their fields, which has in turn allowed my understanding of different subjects to flourish. However, while the education is around the same caliber, it doesn't have the same name recognition as ivy league schools, I sometimes question the use of my tuition money (extensive lawn care, while beautiful, comes at a high price and is a bit excessive around campus), and a lack of grade inflation puts you at a disadvantage when competing against students from other schools for medical school and other fields that look at GPA.""]]",Washington University in St Louis (WashU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Washington-University-in-St-Louis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/67674,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,59,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00130-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,899430963,899366500,HORIZONTAL,"{91084=There's tons of stuff to do for fun! Whether it is going out to shop or eat on the Delmar Loop or going to a Rams or Blues game, there is always something to do in St. Louis if you're looking in the right places. Also, there is a great concert and movie scene right near campus. However, for the majority of the time, most people tend to hang out on or around campus with friends., 148824=Ten minutes down the road is Delmar Boulevard, loving known as The Loop. Here are a multitude of restaurants that easily fit the budget of a college student along with a thrift shop, record store, book store, several clothing stores, and a movie theater. Forest Park is also the campus's front yard and is home to events such as Ballon Glow (a hot air ballon festival) and several free attractions such as the Zoo, Art Museum, and History Museum. Also WashU provides metro passes to the students allowing for fun trips to the Mall, downtown to Busch Stadium for a baseball game, or to Central West End for some exploration., 222706=The campus is insanely awesome with sweet dorms. The people are super friendly, and the campus is very safe with a police headquarters right near the dorms. Saint Louis is really great and Delmar Blvd. is only a short distance away from the school., 194416=There are too many options for food on-campus, and the Delmar Loop, a short walk from campus, is replete with dining options and trendy boutiques., 200693=Wash U is located next to Del Mar Loop, one of America's top streets for entertainment and dining., 139660=Within walking distance from school is the Delmar Loop, which has many shops, restaurants, art galleries, and bars in addition to a hotel, a movie theatre, and a 24/7 bowling alley., 252792=Get involved, don't be afraid to jump into things. I know a great hang out place is Del Mar, so there's lots to do around there., 102809=Located fairly close to campus is the Delmar Loop, a street with dozens of restaurants and stores. Most people go looping with their friends at least once every week, and it is very safe and inviting and fun. Other options are all the campus-sponsored events, or going to Forest Park and the free museums and free zoo., 266884=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 254774=I was dragged against my will to this school by my mother, who thought it would be a good fit. Once I got to campus, I loved the atmosphere, the campus was beautiful, and the community seemed both collaborative and competitive. The wait for their decision is long, but hopefully worth it.

However, I do think the university does a decent job at handing out scholarships, loans and grants based both on merit and need. And the education you receive is top notch with a lot of great resources and activities around, which somewhat accounts for the higher price you pay. Am enjoying being here It is great to be around other motivated students that work hard and also love helping their peers. There are countless groups, clubs and other various activities going on campus all the time. There is something here for everyone. The campus is beautiful and has many conveniences. Campus is also very safe; even late at night, there is no need to worry. It is in a nice part of town too, with a lot to do nearby. I really don't have one complaint about the environment at Wash U. Am learning a lot Wash U is a challenging school, with numerous possibilities. Since it's not a large school, class size is generally smaller, which creates a great learning environment. The handful of large lecture style classes are still very effective, often with a lab or small section to aid your learning. All the",True,0,0,,

In addition, NCAR's future support for national and international research programs with dropsonde systems both with the NCAR C-130 and Electra and in other research aircraft (e.g. NASA DC-8) also required a new system with worldwide operational capability to replace the existing Omega and LORAN systems. This need was primarily driven by the shutdown of the Omega navigation system in 1997 and the potential loss of the LORAN system around 2008. The marginal vertical wind resolution of Omega and LORAN was also a major consideration. Because of the required smoothing interval (60 sec), the vertical wind resolution is only on the order of 300 meters for LORAN and still worse with Omega. GPS promised far superior accuracy in wind profiling. As a result of the mutual requirements for a GPS dropsonde system, NCAR entered into a joint agreement with NOAA and DLR to develop the new GPS dropsonde and aircraft data system with the three organizations sharing the costs for the common portions of the program., 3376=In 1987, ATD's Surface and Sounding Systems Facility (SSSF) began development of an advanced digital dropsonde to support the Office of Naval Research's (ONR) 1988-1989 Experiment on Rapid Intensification of Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA). This development produced the Lightweight LORAN Digital Dropsonde (L2D2), a smart (microprocessor-based) sonde that was lightweight (300 grams vs. 1500 grams for the ODW), incorporated LORAN instead of Omega (Omega was added later in a redesign for the Air Force) for windfinding, and used digital instead of analog circuitry to measure the state parameters and telemeter the data back to the aircraft. This new digital sonde reduced or eliminated noisy data and also provided the capability (extra channels) for incorporation of other measurements. The Lightweight Digital Dropsondes (LD2) have supported numerous national and international field programs, including STORMFEST, TOGA COARE and CEPEX. They have been successfully launched from a variety of aircraft: the U.S. Air Force WC-130, the NCAR Electra, C-130, Sabreliner, and King Air, the University of Wyoming King Air, the NASA DC-8, NOAA P-3's, the Aeromet Learjet, and the DLR Falcon. In 1992 NCAR licensed the LD2 design to Radian Corp., Austin, Texas, which manufactured the sonde for use by the Air Force and the worldwide community., 2029=Above Left: AVAPS and nav systems, dropsonde operator, and sonde launch tube on the NOAA WP-3D Orion aircraft (NOAA/AOC photo).

Right: Hurricane Mitch during intensification to Cat. 5.Ã‚Â  A NOAA drop on 26 October 1998 recorded winds ofÃ‚Â  90 m/s (172 kts) at 500m. Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â , 10951=The winds are derived using a low-cost codeless 8-channel GPS receiver in the dropsonde that tracks the relative Doppler frequency from the RF carrier of the GPS satellite signals containing the satellite and the dropsonde motion. These Doppler frequencies (8 maximum) are digitized and sent back to the aircraft data system as a 1200 baud Frequency Shift Key modulation on the 400 MHz sonde telemetry transmitter. The aircraft data system has a Vaisala winds processing card (MWG201) which contains a high-quality 12-channel GPS commercial full-up receiver (GPS engine) that measures the local carrier phase Doppler frequencies, which are then compared to the telemetered sonde Doppler frequencies. The GPS engine also generates GPS time and the satellite ephemeredes data, and identifies the satellites and their Doppler frequencies so that the Doppler frequencies sent back from the sonde can be identified as coming from a particular satellite to make the wind calculations. The MWG201 card uses this data to compute independent velocity measurements every 0.5 seconds., 16264=Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â• GPS Processing Card. The GPS processing card (Vaisala model MWG20 1) processes the 1200 baud FSK signal from the telemetry receiver to compute winds from the Doppler frequencies measured by the dropsonde. There are four MWG201's in the telemetry chassis, one for each of the four channels. Each MWG201 contains a high-quality 12-channel commercial GPS full-up (code-correlating) receiver that measures the local satellite RF carrier Doppler frequencies. The 12-channel receiver also generates GPS time and time satellite ephemerides, and identifies the satellites and their Doppler frequencies. The local Doppler frequencies are then compared with the telemetered dropsonde Doppler frequencies; this allows the frequencies sent back from the sonde to be identified as originating from a particular satellite. The MWG201 then removes the satellite component of motion. However, since the MWG201 is itself moving, the aircraft velocity must now be eliminated to obtain the actual motion of the sonde. The internally-computed GPS motion of the MWG201 is used for this purpose, although the aircraft's own flight data system can also be used. In the former configuration, the final wind estimate is susceptible to errors from Selective Availability (SA), the U.S. military's artificial degradation of GPS signals. Initial identification of the GPS satellites after launch typically takes about 30 s, although acquisition times of 60 s are not uncommon; during this interval no winds are computed. After initial acquisition, the MWG201 card computes independent velocity measurements every 0.5 s (about 5m in the vertical near the surface). Filtering to remove observational noise is generally not required, unlike with LORAN, which requires 60 s filtering, or Omega (180-240 s). Winds are obtained until the sonde telemetry fails at splashdown.}","Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Dropsonde Sensor Specifications Ã‚Â  dropsonde incorporates a new pressure, temperature, humidity sensor module (RSS903) and a new GPS receiver module (GPS111), both designed by Vaisala, Inc., for their RS90 radiosonde. The sensor specifications are shown in the following table: Description of the NCAR GPSÃ‚Â Dropsonde The RF transmission bandwidth of < 20 kHz. Operation out to a telemetry range of 325 km, and a Sonde shelf life 3 years, Sonde size 2.75 inches (6.98 cm) diameter by 16 inches (40.6 cm) long, Sonde weight < 400 grams, 0.5-second sample rate for wind and thermodynamic data, Sonde descent time approximately 12 minutes when released from 12 km, Simultaneous operation of up to four sondes (4-channel data system), Deployment at indicated airspeeds up to 250 kts, Global operation, at altitudes up to 24 km, The following are the original NOAA/DLR/NCAR dropsonde system design requirements, now specifications of the operational system. The requirements for the DLR STRATO 2C and NOAA G-IV dropsonde systems were nearly identical, including the time schedule for delivery. In addition, NCAR's future support for national and international research programs with dropsonde systems both with the NCAR C-130 and Electra and in other research aircraft (e.g. NASA DC-8) also required a new system with worldwide operational capability to replace the existing Omega and LORAN systems. This need was primarily driven by the shutdown of","The winds are derived using a low-cost codeless 8-channel GPS receiver in the dropsonde that tracks the relative Doppler frequency from the RF carrier of the GPS satellite signals containing the satellite and the dropsonde motion.

Surface mount technology is used on the electronics board to reduce size and increase the ease of manufacture. In addition, the electronics board contains a connector that serves as an RS-232 link with the aircraft data system",True,0,0,"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 16:46:09 GMT",

But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses Ã¢Â€ÂœyeaÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœnayÃ¢Â€? when voting on the final passage of bills. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in Ã¢Â€Âœordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.Ã¢Â€? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

The subsequent review resulted in modifications to statements on teaching criteria (see Section E) but not in creation of non-tenure-track faculty status. See Policy A-2.

This reopening of the fishery vacates the closure made by NMFS on September 5, 2014. Following the closure, NMFS received updated information indicating that only 404 mt of the 500 mt catch limit was caught. Thus, the closure was imposed prematurely.

The final rule also included a requirement for the owners and operators of such vessels to submit Ã¢Â€Âœdaily FAD reportsÃ¢Â€? to NMFS. As indicated in the December 2, 2014, final rule, some of the FAD restrictions are to go into effect only if NMFS publishes a notice in the Federal Register announcing that they are in effect. NMFS intended to make the requirement to submit daily FAD reports also contingent on issuance of a Federal Register notice, but inadvertently wrote the final rule such that the reporting requirement would go into effect on January 1, 2015, irrespective of issuance by NMFS of a Federal Register notice. This document corrects that error in the final rule by making the requirement to submit daily FAD reports contingent on NMFS issuing a Federal Register notice announcing that it is in effect., 46763=Ã‚Â§ 1802 - Definitions, 24316=NMFS issues regulations under authority of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act (WCPFC Implementation Act) to revise the 2014 limit on fishing effort by U.S. purse seine vessels in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (U.S. EEZ) and on the high seas between the latitudes of 20Ã‚Â° N. and 20Ã‚Â° S. in the area of application of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention). The total limit for 2014 is revised from 2,588 fishing days to 1,828 fishing days. This action is necessary for the United States to implement provisions of a conservation and management measure (CMM) adopted by the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Commission) and to satisfy the obligations of the United States under the Convention, to which it is a Contracting Party., 48765=Ã‚Â§ 2436 - Regulations, 48459=Ã‚Â§ 2433 - Representatives, 46947=Ã‚Â§ 1821 note - Foreign fishing, 49512=Ã‚Â§ 2444 - Severability, 33979=This final rule implements a management framework for specifying catch and effort limits and accountability measures for pelagic fisheries in the U.S. Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).

A territory may allocate up to 1,000 mt of that limit to eligible U.S. longline fishing vessels. This final rule also makes several technical administrative changes to the regulations and announces the effectiveness of collection-of-information requirements. This action is consistent with international objectives of ending overfishing of bigeye tuna, while allowing for the limited transfer of available catch limits between U.S participating territories and eligible U.S. fisheries, consistent with the conservation requirements of the bigeye tuna stock., 46845=Ã‚Â§ 1803 - Authorization of appropriations, 48675=Ã‚Â§ 2435 - Unlawful activities, 106938=NMFS proposes regulations under authority of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act (WCPFC Implementation Act) to establish restrictions on the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by U.S. purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean.

This reopening of the fishery vacates the closure made by NMFS on September 5, 2014. Following the closure, NMFS received updated information indicating that only 404 mt of the 500 mt catch limit was caught. Thus, the closure was imposed prematurely.

This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold vehicles included different option combinations than your specified vehicle configuration.
