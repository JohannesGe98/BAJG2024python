Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant.

The Commission's Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee has scheduled a public meeting to be held on February 26, 2015, which will consider, among other matters, exemptions for bona fide hedging positions.

Regulation SBSR provides for the reporting of security-based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories (Ã¢Â€Âœregistered SDRsÃ¢Â€?) or the Commission, and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered SDRs. Registered SDRs are required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance.

The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 124132=This release makes technical corrections to rules that were published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2014.

Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant.

Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance.

Regulation SBSR provides for the reporting of security-based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories (Ã¢Â€Âœregistered SDRsÃ¢Â€?) or the Commission, and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered SDRs. Registered SDRs are required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance.

Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance.

The Commission's Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee has scheduled a public meeting to be held on February 26, 2015, which will consider, among other matters, exemptions for bona fide hedging positions.

Regulation SBSR provides for the reporting of security-based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories (Ã¢Â€Âœregistered SDRsÃ¢Â€?) or the Commission, and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered SDRs. Registered SDRs are required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance.

The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 124132=This release makes technical corrections to rules that were published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2014.

Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant.

Specifically, the staff is updating the Series in order to bring existing guidance into conformity with a recent consensus of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-17Ã¢Â€Â”Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)., 14400=We are adopting amendments to Regulation A and other rules and forms to implement Section 401 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Section 401 of the JOBS Act added Section 3(b)(2) to the Securities Act of 1933, which directs the Commission to adopt rules exempting from the registration requirements of the Securities Act offerings of up to $50 million of securities annually. The final rules include issuer eligibility requirements, content and filing requirements for offering statements, and ongoing reporting requirements for issuers in Regulation A offerings., 119364=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is making technical amendments to update control numbers assigned to information collection requirements of the Commission by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980., 149452=The Securities and Exchange Commission is amending rule 206(3)-3T under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a temporary rule that establishes an alternative means for investment advisers that are registered with the Commission as broker-dealers to meet the requirements of section 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act when they act in a principal capacity in transactions with certain of their advisory clients. The amendment extends the date on which rule 206(3)-3T will sunset from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2016., 73435=In accordance with Section 763 and Section 766 of Title VII (Ã¢Â€ÂœTitle VIIÃ¢Â€?) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting Regulation SBSRÃ¢Â€Â”Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information (Ã¢Â€ÂœRegulation SBSRÃ¢Â€?) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?). Regulation SBSR provides for the reporting of security-based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories (Ã¢Â€Âœregistered SDRsÃ¢Â€?) or the Commission, and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered SDRs. Registered SDRs are required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy these requirements through substituted compliance. Finally, Regulation SBSR will require a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a securities information processor., 316599=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 (Ã¢Â€ÂœRuleÃ¢Â€?) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœActÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), which exempts certain brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national securities association (Ã¢Â€ÂœAssociationÃ¢Â€?). The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 124132=This release makes technical corrections to rules that were published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2014. The Commission adopted revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure, and reporting for asset-backed securities. These technical amendments are being published to reinstate language that was inadvertently removed and make other technical corrections., 9157=The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to support the 2015 US GAAP financial reporting and 2015 EXCH taxonomies; add new form types for registration of Security-based swap data repositories (SDR); revise the Form ID Application Confirmation screen; remove references to the Paper Form ID; and revise Item 1 on submission form type MA-A. The EDGAR system was upgraded to support the new 2015 taxonomies and revised MA-A form functionalities on March 9, 2015. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded to support the other functionalities on April 13, 2015., 266039=We are proposing amendments to Item 402 of Regulation S-K to implement Section 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), as added by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?). Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant. The proposed disclosure would be required in proxy or information statements in which executive compensation disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K is required. The proposed disclosure requirements would not apply to emerging growth companies or foreign private issuers.}",{1136=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01.}
