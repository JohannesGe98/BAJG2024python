Unable to read or write, Clareece shows little prospect for the future until discovering that she has been accepted into an alternative school. There, with a little help from a sympathetic teacher (Paula Patton) and a kindly nurse (Lenny Kravitiz), the young girl receives something that most teens never get -- a chance to start over.

Following a fine 2006 campaign when Paulino hit a surprising .310, many observers believed the oversized backstop's batting average would drop but his power numbers would increase. In the final analysis, that's exactly what happened but the road was bumpier than Wrigley Field's infield. Paulino got off a .218 start (34-for-156) the first two months of the season, when many fantasy owners likely dropped him. His stance at the plate prevented him from reaching outside corner strikes. Amazingly, he did little to correct his approach but raised his final batting average to .263 by hitting .293 after the All-Star break. His defense ranked among the worst in the league, as relay throws to home plate were commonly dropped and passed balls were the norm. Still, as it stands, the Pirates haven't signed another backstop to compete with Paulino, and Ryan Doumit is even worse defensively, meaning Paulino could start another 130-plus games. If you draft the lumbering catcher, make sure you have a plentiful stock of aspirin., 49034=5/20/2013, 44832=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. √Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†Jump To:√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† √¢¬ñ¬≤ Basic Stats √Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† √¢¬ñ¬≤ Split Stats √Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† √¢¬ñ¬≤ Games By Position, 55650=2009, 59609=2003, 54710=John Baker's injury hurt Paulino's 2010 numbers, as he's better suited in a platoon where he only has to face left-handers than as an everyday player. His PED suspension brought a sudden end to his Marlins tenure, though, and he'll pick his career back up with the Mets as Josh Thole's veteran caddy. If New York can make sure he doesn't see much right-handed pitching, he could be a useful second fantasy catcher., 49973=3/30/2013, 54037=2012, 54089=Paulino was signed by the Mets to a one-year deal to serve as a right-handed complement to Josh Thole. He missed the first month while completing a suspension for PED usage and illness, but got off to a strong start driven mainly by an unsustainable BABIP. Paulino crashed back to earth, going just 25-for-124 over the last three months and getting dogged by questions about his defense and work ethic. The Mets non-tendered him in December and he will look to hook on elsewhere to fill a similar part-time platoon role., 48031=8/13/2013, 58348=2006, 51880=2/15/2013, 52841=1/23/2013, 55173=2010, 58400=Paulino is coming off of a fine 2005 campaign that reignited his prospect status. The 25-year-old catcher, who split time between Double-A and Triple-A ball, hit a combined .306 with 19 home runs and 62 RBI. Claimed by the Royals as a Rule 5 player by the Royals in 2003 and then returned, he had a cup of coffee with the Pirates in September and went 2-for-4. He's a capable defender with good size (6-foot-3, 235 pounds). With injuries to catchers Ryan Doumit and Humberto Cota -- a very possible scenario -- Paulino could see time with Pittsburgh in 2006. His offensive potential at a weak-hitting position makes him worth keeping an eye on., 47090=11/12/2013, 57650=2007, 55702=New Pirates manager John Russell told Paulino late in spring training that Ryan Doumit was his starting catcher and Paulino never really recovered. After seeing sporadic time in Pittsburgh, the team finally shipped him out to Triple-A Indianapolis at the beginning of June. Following a first game in which he went 5-for-5, Paulino suffered an ankle injury that cost him most of his summer. Paulino finished 2008 with a .302 batting average in the minors and .212 with Pittsburgh. He'll get a change of scenery after being dealt to the Phillies and could help the big catcher re-start a career that saw him hit .310 as a rookie in 2006., 46097=2/12/2014, 56386=2008, 59145=Paulino, who batted .285 with 15 homers and 60 RBI in 99 games for Double-A Altoona in 2004 and was added to the Pirates 40-man roster in October, has thrown out 40 percent of those trying to steal against him since the 1999 season. It's not likely that Paulino will make any sort of fantasy impact in 2005, but the Pirates don't want to lose the catcher in the Rule 5 draft like they did following the 2002 season., 59093=2005, 54658=2011, 57702=It wouldn't at all be surprising to see Paulino post more catcher-like numbers, both offensively and defensively, in 2007. As a rookie, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound backstop, who looks a lot more like Albert Pujols than Mike Lavalliere, had Spanky-like power production. Paulino, 25, batted an outstanding .310 in 442 at-bats but hit just six home runs with 55 RBI. Defensively he was a wreck, ranking among the league leaders in errors (11) and passed balls (9), though pitchers seemed comfortable with him behind the plate. Look for his defense to improve in 2007 -- if it doesn't, Ryan Doumit looms., 50898=2/17/2013}","{4452=See Our 2015 Projections, 5049=2015 Preseason Projections, 3987=2015 ADP: √¢¬Ä¬ì, 2563=Paulino signed a minor league contract with the Tigers in November of 2013., 2312=July√Ç¬†19,√Ç¬†2014 √Ç¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì√Ç¬† Ronny Paulino News, 4218=There was no outlook written for Ronny Paulino in 2015.

The project with RSG aims to build the capacities and skill development of the local communities to organise the Environmental Educational Tourism in partnership with the schools. A major output would be a field tested, developed through this action research, manual for rural communities to initiate the operations in entrepreneur manner. The integrated approach for natural resources management and enhance rural livelihoods is based on premises that: the rural poor require capacity building support and resources to explore livelihood options; the management of natural resources is more efficient when linked to economic incentive to the local communities managing those resources; and that an effective local environmental governance could yield results in terms of Ecosystem Services at local, regional and global level for supporting the livelihoods of the poor associated with it. Thus, the idea approaches co-benefits and co- existence by mainstreaming livelihood based management of natural resources and involving the Village Forest Councils (Van Panchaysts - VPs in Hindi).

Nowadays, I incorporate a lot of my visual art experience in my promo materials and website (which I am currently redesigning by the way).√Ç¬† I've always loved art and intrigued by the innumerable ways that space can be utilized and occupied.√Ç¬† A blank canvas is so FULL of possibility. I recently put up some of my old artwork on my walls in my room, and here are some photos for your eyes to feast on .√Ç¬† .√Ç¬† . A few years ago at a conference, I was asked to be creative with my name badge, and this is what I came up with.√Ç¬† I've kept this ever since. This drawing of a heart is a doodle that is an rough draft of a piece I hope to some day do in the future.√Ç¬† It is just a fraction of the concept that I have in mind. This was one of a series of abstract faces that I drew a while back.√Ç¬† He actually has a female counterpart that I donated to a charity auction.√Ç¬† She sits quietly back in Charlotte, NC in the living room of the young man who submitted the winning bid.√Ç¬† You might notice a similarity to the piece that wound up being my album cover for ""Seahorses"". This was a rough sketch for a later, much bigger piece that I was envisioning.√Ç¬† Though I'm certain it was the sun I was drawing, I can't seem to remember what I was going for on the whole. The band Counting Crows' debut album ""August and Everything After"" is one of my all-time favorite albums.√Ç¬†√Ç¬† This was my rendering of the album cover, and I think I got it pretty darn close. For a coffeehouse show I did back in March, I did the artwork for the promo poster.√Ç¬† This bizarre one turned out pretty well. I wanted to go bright and bold with this poster and give it a handmade feel.√Ç¬†√Ç¬† This was for my Cafe Coco show last October.√Ç¬† I'm not even sure what kind of flowers those are supposed to be, but this one was a lot of fun to create. Back in 2003, I did a HUGE art installation.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† A photographer friend of mine named Chris Hafner took photos of various subjects for me.√Ç¬† I, in turn, transformed them into what I call ""kaleidoscopic collages"" intertwined with poetry.√Ç¬†√Ç¬† This was one of the resulting works.√Ç¬† It currently hangs in my bedroom for me to enjoy every day. I've been itching to do more drawing and sketching lately, and I have some ideas I want to sketch out.√Ç¬† Maybe someday I'll do another art exhibit. In any case, I just wanted to share, and I'll share more soon.

For a further discussion regarding our internal controls, see √Ç¬ìInternal control√Ç¬î in this annual report. Any failure to strengthen our internal controls could result in accounting errors or misstatements in our financial statements and could harm the reliability of our financial statements, which could in turn adversely affect investor confidence and the prices of our common shares and ADSs., 888080=impact was more than offset by lower impairments and integration expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 and higher gains on disposal of non-current assets in 2005 compared to 2004. In addition, our operating income in 2005 was positively impacted by improved operating income at U.S. Foodservice, Schuitema and in the Stop√Ç¬†& Shop/Giant-Landover Arena, partially offset by lower operating income in the Giant-Carlisle/Tops Arena and the Albert Heijn Arena. Operating income in 2005 compared to 2004 was also negatively impacted by the fact that 2005 consisted of 52 weeks while 2004 consisted of 53 weeks., 698246=We introduced a three-step program in 2003 to restore the value of U.S. Foodservice as part of our Road to Recovery strategy. The three steps are: (1)√Ç¬†improving internal controls and corporate governance; (2)√Ç¬†restoring profitability and cash flow; and (3)√Ç¬†pursuing profitable sales growth. We have already made significant progress and have implemented a number of initiatives and changes at U.S. Foodservice to clarify accountability, improve our internal controls and strengthen our corporate governance. In 2004 we implemented a comprehensive plan focusing on organizational improvements, procurement enhancements, operational and system improvements at U.S. Foodservice in order to restore profitability and cash flow.

Under the terms of the agreement, the lead plaintiffs agree to settle all claims against Ahold for the sum of USD 1.1 billion (EUR 937 million). This amount includes USD 9√Ç¬†million (EUR 8 million) as compensation to the VEB for facilitating the global settlement.

We raised approximately EUR 2.9 billion in net equity proceeds, reduced gross debt by approximately EUR 5.8 billion, negotiated a new, unsecured syndicated EUR 2 billion credit facility with more favorable terms and conditions than the prior facility, completed divestments for cash consideration and assumed debt totaling EUR 3.1 billion. As a result of our efforts, we have improved our liquidity, strengthened our balance sheet and better positioned ourselves for the future by divesting non-core and under-performing assets., 703680=We plan to implement an arena-wide value improvement program at both Stop√Ç¬†& Shop and Giant-Landover. Starting in 2006, this program will be implemented over the next three years in phases applying a product category-by-category approach. This program has similar objectives to the value repositioning program that we have successfully implemented at Albert Heijn and ICA. However, the starting points and competitive environments are different and we have designed the value improvement program specifically for the region and the market of the Stop√Ç¬†& Shop/Giant-Landover Arena to help us compete effectively with the supermarkets and alternative outlets of our competitors., 465703=In November 2005 we also entered into an agreement to settle litigation with the VEB. Under the terms of this settlement agreement, the VEB has terminated certain legal proceedings relating to our annual accounts and has agreed not to pursue any further legal action in the inquiry proceedings before the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals., 924063=Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.

Under IFRS the share in income (loss) of our joint ventures and associates is required to be included in income before tax without a corresponding income tax expense effect. Because of our loss before income taxes in 2005, the application of IFRS contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate in 2005 compared to our 2004 income before income taxes, in which year the application of IFRS led to a reduction of our effective tax rate. Furthermore, a tax exempt capital gain of EUR 38√Ç¬†million with respect to the release of the D&S litigation provision had a positive impact on the effective tax rate in 2005, whereas additional valuation allowances related to loss carry-forwards in our Central Europe Arena had a negative impact on the effective tax rate in 2005., 10773=If this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section√Ç¬†13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†Yes √Ç¬®√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†No√Ç¬†√Ç¬†x, 240980=Stephanie Shern (January 7, 1948) is a U.S. national.

In 2004 we acquired an additional 20% interest in ICA (10% of which we transferred to our joint venture partner) pursuant to the exercise of a put option by one of the ICA partners. Our net financial expense in 2005 also increased as a result of an additional one-time loss of EUR 53√Ç¬†million relating to a bond buy back transaction in October 2005 and as a result of the EUR 39√Ç¬†million gain in 2004 relating to a derivative hedge that no longer qualified for hedge accounting., 453069=During the course of the closing and the annual audit of our 2004 financial statements two material weaknesses and a number of reportable conditions under the interim standards of the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as well as other internal control issues were identified.

We closed 2005 with EUR 2.2 billion total cash balances and we reduced gross debt by 22.7% (EUR 2.3 billion) during 2005. The lower average outstanding debt balances, lower average cost of debt and lower banking fees contributed to lower net interest expense in 2005.

Despite the continued strong competition and the weak economy in Portugal, JMR increased its net sales in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of higher identical sales and an increase in the number of its stores. Gross profit margin decreased in 2005 compared to 2004, mainly due to fierce price competition. Operating income increased in 2005 primarily as a result of higher net sales and lower operating costs. However, a higher effective tax rate resulted in a lower net income in 2005 compared to 2004., 298724=The composition of the Audit Committee changed during 2005, as Lodewijk de Vink and Rene Dahan resigned from the Audit Committee and Derk Doijer and Stephanie Shern were appointed to the Audit Committee in May 2005., 152740=Nevertheless, 2005 has been a difficult year with mixed performance in our key business arenas.

Expected total costs during the five-year term of the outsourcing agreements is approximately EUR 467√Ç¬†million based on expected levels of services. Subject to termination charges, we may terminate each of the agreements by giving our outsourcing partner six months notice. Approximately 450 Ahold employees located in the U.S. and the Netherlands are expected to transition to EDS.

The decrease was primarily a result of the de-consolidation of the Baltic operations and the sale of the Danish operations. Excluding the impacts of the de-consolidation of the Baltic operations and the sale of the Danish operations, net sales in SEK increased by 3.8% in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales at ICA Sverige increased, primarily due to the successful value repositioning program.

ICA Norge reported increased operating income in 2005 primarily as a result of cost cuts and higher gains on property sales. As reported by ICA, ICA Meny and ICA√Ç¬ís joint venture Rimi Baltic improved, 479407=U.S. Foodservice accounts for a substantial portion of our net sales.

The chairman of the Supervisory Board will determine whether there is a conflict of interest. If a member of the Corporate Executive Board has a conflict of interest with the Company, such member shall not participate in the discussions and/or decision making process on a subject or transaction in relation to which such member has a conflict of interest. The chairman of the Supervisory Board shall arrange for such transactions to be disclosed in the annual report. There were no conflicts of interest in 2005., 37777=Until 2004, we prepared our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (√Ç¬ìDutch GAAP√Ç¬î).

The Audit Committee closely monitored the Company√Ç¬ís efforts to improve and strengthen its internal controls, including with respect to the two material weaknesses and other internal control issues which were reported in the 2004 annual report. The 2004 material weaknesses related to accounting for income tax provisions and to U.S. GAAP financial statement reconciliation process and no longer exist as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Every quarter a report from the whistleblower procedure was provided to the Audit Committee and discussed with the Corporate Executive Board in the meetings. Regularly the Audit Committee was informed on litigation and the related exposure. The Audit Committee was updated on IT whereby information strategy, information architecture, outsourcing, information management governance and information security were addressed. The Audit Committee assessed the independence and performance of the external auditor and for that purpose pre-approved the fees for audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the external auditors as, 344396=NEW REMUNERATION POLICY 2006 2, 412157=Any shares held by us or our subsidiaries in our own capital may not be voted.

As of the date of this annual report, we have not acquired any shares under this authorization., 835803=The following table sets forth our operating expenses by category for 2005 and 2004:, 675676=The additional week in 2004 also had a significant impact on our results of operations in 2005. Our 2005 results compared to 2004 were negatively affected by the fact that 2004 on a consolidated basis and for many of our operations consisted of 53 weeks, while 2005 consisted of 52 weeks. This is not applicable for Ahold√Ç¬ís operations in the Central Europe Arena and the joint ventures and associates. The financial year for these entities corresponds to the calendar year. For a discussion of our financial years, including year-end dates, see √Ç¬ìGeneral information√Ç¬î in this annual report. For a reconciliation of net sales excluding week 53 of 2004, see √Ç¬ìReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures√Ç¬î below. Our retail business generally experiences an increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of each year (which in 2004 included week 53), primarily as a result of the holiday season., 862075=We recorded a gain on the disposal of non-current assets of EUR 52√Ç¬†million in 2005, compared to a gain of EUR 15√Ç¬†million in 2004.

Our gain on the disposal of non-current assets in 2004 included a EUR 9√Ç¬†million gain on the sale of a shopping center in the Central Europe Arena., 712021=Starting in 2006, U.S. Foodservice was split into two separate operating companies, each of which serves a different customer segment:, 680402=In October 2005, we successfully closed solicitations to sell selected outstanding notes of Ahold which decreased our indebtedness by approximately EUR 1 billion equivalent, which will further reduce our annualized net interest expense going forward. We also made a voluntary funding of EUR 236√Ç¬†million to our pension program in the U.S. These transactions all utilized available cash balances. Our improved liquidity position and stronger balance sheet enabled us in February 2005 to terminate our three-year revolving December 2003 credit facility (the √Ç¬ìDecember 2003 Credit Facility√Ç¬î). In May 2005, Ahold signed a new five-year EUR 2 billion unsecured syndicated multi-currency credit facility (the √Ç¬ìMay 2005 Credit Facility√Ç¬î) with a syndicate of banks having more favorable terms and conditions than the December 2003 Credit Facility. The new credit facility is intended to be used for general corporate purposes and for the issuance of letters of credit and remained undrawn except for EUR 588√Ç¬†million (USD 696 million) utilized for letters of credit at the end of 2005. For further details and information, see Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and √Ç¬ìLiquidity and capital resources - Assessment of liquidity and capital resources.√Ç¬î, 863122=Our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the charge of EUR 803√Ç¬†million in operating income, which includes insurance proceeds, for the agreement to settle the Securities Class Action. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in the Securities Class Action, the lead plaintiffs agree to settle all claims in the Securities Class Action against Ahold, its subsidiaries, the individual defendants and the underwriters for the sum of USD 1.1 billion (EUR 937 million). This amount includes USD 9√Ç¬†million (EUR 8 million) as compensation to the VEB for facilitating the global settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. Excluding the impact of the settlement, net of the insurance proceeds, our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2005 compared to 2004. For more information on the settlement of the Securities Class Action, see Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 175669=We expect that U.S. Foodservice√Ç¬ís operating margin in U.S. dollars before impairment of goodwill will exceed 1.7% no later than 2006., 136422=2003, 220866=Peter Wakkie (June 22, 1948) is a Dutch national. Mr.√Ç¬†Wakkie joined Ahold as acting Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Governance Counsel on October√Ç¬†15, 2003.

Prior to joining Ahold, he was a partner at law firm De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, which he joined in 1972, specializing in mergers and acquisitions and corporate litigation.

Prior to joining Ahold, Mr.√Ç¬†Brouwer held the position of manager of Human Resources Planning and Development at Mercedes-Benz Nederland B.V., 161294=As part of our Road to Recovery strategy we have implemented many initiatives and changes to clarify accountability, improve internal controls and strengthen corporate governance. We have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the two material weaknesses reported in our 2004 Annual Report no longer exist. For additional information, see √Ç¬ìCorporate governance√Ç¬î and √Ç¬ìInternal control√Ç¬î., 851271=Our general and administrative expenses decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily because of the one-time costs of USD 54√Ç¬†million (EUR 44 million) in 2004 related to the integration of Giant-Landover, Stop√Ç¬†& Shop and the U.S. retail support service. Our net payments to AIG Europe (the Netherlands) N.V. in connection with the settlement of insurance coverage litigation with respect to a director√Ç¬ís and officer√Ç¬ís liability insurance policy issued by AIG for Ahold and U.S. Foodservice were USD 31.5√Ç¬†million (EUR 25.5 million), both in 2005 and 2004., 853295=Our amortization of intangible assets decreased by EUR 24√Ç¬†million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of lower amortization in the Stop√Ç¬†& Shop/Giant-Landover Arena., 681909=In 2003, we announced our intention to generate at least EUR 2.5 billion of gross proceeds by divesting non-core businesses and under-performing assets by the end of 2005. For these purposes, √Ç¬ìgross proceeds√Ç¬î means cash consideration and assumed debt. We have succeeded in our mission and by the end of 2005, the aggregate gross proceeds from the divestments amounted to EUR 3.1 billion. Of this amount, EUR 1.6 billion was generated in 2005, EUR 1.1 billion in 2004 and EUR 0.4 billion in 2003 resulting in net cash from the divestment of consolidated subsidiaries of EUR 1,058√Ç¬†million in 2005, EUR 978√Ç¬†million in 2004 and EUR 284√Ç¬†million in 2003. We applied the cash received from our divestments to, 253904=The Supervisory Board was regularly updated on the major legal proceedings and held a special meeting to approve the settlement in the securities class action. Mainly through the Audit Committee, regular updates were provided on the operation of the internal control and risk management systems and corporate governance with a focus on compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the project to comply with the requirements of Section√Ç¬†404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as of December√Ç¬†31, 2006. Reports from the whistleblower procedure and the necessary follow-up were addressed. The quarterly results and press releases were discussed and the budget 2006 was approved. The agenda for the annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May√Ç¬†18, 2005 as well as the annual report 2004 were approved., 151528=A significant milestone for us was the USD 1.1 billion (EUR 929 million) settlement of the securities class action brought against Ahold in 2003, subject to court approval. It is the last of our outstanding material litigations with significant financial exposure from that time., 854499=Our impairment losses relating to goodwill increased by EUR√Ç¬†19√Ç¬†million in 2005 compared to 2004. In 2005, we recorded impairment losses of goodwill of EUR 14√Ç¬†million in the Giant-Carlisle/Tops Arena, EUR 3√Ç¬†million at Schuitema and EUR 2√Ç¬†million in the Albert Heijn Arena., 995307=The following table sets forth net sales, store counts and sales area information for the Giant-Carlisle/Tops Arena in 2005 and 2004:, 604379=No single customer accounted for more than 10% of U.S. Foodservice√Ç¬ís net sales in 2005., 713880=The reorganization of U.S. Foodservice into these two operating companies is intended to drive greater focus on the specific needs of each of these different businesses and to provide stakeholders with greater transparency into U.S. Foodservice√Ç¬ís progress in achieving its targets. Ahold will change its segment reporting to reflect these changes in financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2006., 258856=The members that joined the Supervisory Board in 2005 attended a full-day induction program at our offices in Zaandam or Amsterdam. Senior management briefed the members of the Supervisory Board on their responsibilities as members of the Supervisory Board and the financial, legal and reporting affairs of the Company and its businesses. Members of the Supervisory Board visited several arenas and other parts of the business during the year., 133952=2001, 696839=In November 2003, we launched a program of strategic business cost saving initiatives aimed at improving our competitiveness. These initiatives are expected to lower costs related to sourcing, information technology, supply chain and store operations. Our arenas and operating companies share responsibility for the initiatives together with our Business Support Office (the √Ç¬ìBSO√Ç¬î). The BSO, which was established in connection with the launch of the, 463548=Due to the events announced on February√Ç¬†24, 2003, our 2002 annual report included a restatement of our financial position and results for 2001 and 2000 in part because of accounting irregularities at one of our operating subsidiaries, U.S. Foodservice, and because certain of our joint ventures had been improperly consolidated. These events led to a number of investigations and legal proceedings. For a further discussion of these investigations and legal proceedings, see Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 1020710=and 10 of the 31 eastern New York stores planned for divestment were closed or sold in 2005., 258313=Benno Hoogendoorn was appointed to the Supervisory Board as of May√Ç¬†18, 2005.

Our core values are rooted in Ahold√Ç¬ís heritage and reflect our ambitions for the future. Increasing the focus on our core capabilities will help us build upon what we do best and differentiate us from the competition., 11589=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)√Ç¬†has filed all reports required to be filed by Section√Ç¬†13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)√Ç¬†has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†Yes√Ç¬†√Ç¬†x√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†No√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬®, 237374=Jan Hommen (April 29, 1943) is a Dutch national.

Mr.√Ç¬†Hommen is former CFO and vice chairman of the board of management of Royal Philips Electronics N.V. He is chairman of the supervisory board of TNT N.V., chairman of the board of Reed Elsevier N.V., and member of the supervisory board of ING Groep N.V.

She is a member of the board of Jaakko P√É¬∂yry Group Oyj and director of Lonmin Plc and of Merrill Lynch New Energy Technology Plc., 488056=Relating to the events in early 2003, Moody√Ç¬ís Investors Services (√Ç¬ìMoody√Ç¬ís√Ç¬î) and Standard√Ç¬†& Poor√Ç¬ís Ratings Services (√Ç¬ìS&P√Ç¬î) downgraded our credit ratings to below investment grade ratings. As part of our strategy to restore our financial health, we are focused on working towards meeting the applicable investment grade ratings criteria. During 2004 and 2005, both Moody√Ç¬ís and S&P upgraded our credit ratings, but such credit ratings remain below investment grade. While none of our material credit facilities or other debt instruments contain direct events of default that are triggered by credit rating downgrades, a downgrade of our long-term debt rating by either Moody√Ç¬ís or S&P could raise liquidity concerns, reduce our flexibility in accessing a broad array of funding sources and increase our costs of borrowing, which could result in our inability to secure new financing or affect our ability to make payments on outstanding debt instruments and comply with other existing obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the applicable investment grade rating criteria, particularly if our operating strategy and objectives are not successful. For a further discussion of our credit ratings, see √Ç¬ìManagement√Ç¬ís discussion√Ç¬†& analysis√Ç¬ñLiquidity and capital resources√Ç¬î and Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 994743=18 stores as part of its store upgrade program over the next two years. In addition, health care costs are expected to increase in 2006., 921060=In 2005, our result on divestments decreased compared to 2004. In 2005, we realized a gain of EUR 172√Ç¬†million on the divestments of Paiz Ahold, Deli XL, G. Barbosa, BI-LO and Bruno√Ç¬ís, compared to a gain on divestments of EUR 238√Ç¬†million in 2004 relating to the divestments of Bompre√É¬ßo / Hipercard, Disco and our operations in Spain and Thailand., 416984=No cumulative preferred shares are currently outstanding. We entered into an option agreement with Stichting Ahold Continu√É¬Øteit (√Ç¬ìSAC√Ç¬î) designed to exercise influence with respect to a potential change in control over us. SAC is a Dutch foundation whose statutory purpose is to enhance our continuity, independence and identity in case of a hostile takeover attempt. As of March√Ç¬†28, 2006, the members of the board of SAC were:, 850293=Our selling expenses and selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 because of increased selling expenses of in some of our arenas, particularly selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the Central Europe Arena and at Schuitema. The increase in the Central Europe Arena was primarily a result of higher net sales, various project costs and a write-off of supplier receivables and inventories related to stock-taking differences. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the Albert Heijn Arena, primarily as a result of cost reductions and efficiency improvements with respect to logistic and transportation expenses., 477614=For 2006 and onward, we have defined a growth strategy based on core values that our operating companies share and core capabilities that we are improving. In 2005, competitive and operating cost pressures in our retail markets were greater than expected and the turnaround at certain of our businesses was slower than planned. The financial targets we originally set for retail in 2003 have become increasingly challenging. Based on the retail trends we have seen so far in 2006, we expect our retail net sales growth in 2006 to be between 2.5% and 3.0% (assuming constant currency exchange rates and excluding divestments made in 2005). In addition, we expect that our retail operating margin will be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2006. Our overall priority remains to drive net sales growth and achieve a retail operating margin of 5%. We may encounter difficulties or delays in implementing our strategic initiatives and we may not be able to achieve the expected retail net sales growth and retail operating margin. We may also incur unanticipated costs in implementing our strategy. We have planned certain levels of capital expenditures and launched several strategic initiatives for our food retail business. These include initiatives that we expect will allow us to realize gross cost savings aggregating approximately EUR 650√Ç¬†million by the end of 2006. However, we may not be able to reach the targeted levels or receive the expected benefits of these cost savings and capital expenditures. If we do not successfully carry out our strategy with respect to our food retail business, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity., 481976=We have significantly reduced our debt as part of our Road to Recovery strategy. However, we continue to have substantial indebtedness and our total gross debt at the end of 2005 was approximately EUR 7.7 billion. In addition to the obligations recorded on our balance sheet, we also have various commitments and contingent liabilities that may result in significant future cash requirements. Although some of our debt instruments and other arrangements place conditions on our incurring further debt, we are not barred from doing so. To the extent we incur incremental debt, our leverage risk will increase. Our significant level of debt could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including but not limited to, the following:, 711538=In November 2005, we announced our strategic plan focused on pursuing profitable sales growth at U.S. Foodservice. The strategic plan includes the following initiatives:, 144056=November 2005, 697460=cost savings program in 2003, facilitates the development of the various initiatives., 146503=March 2006, 696321=On August√Ç¬†1, 2005 we announced our plans to grow our business in key markets through selective acquisitions. On the same day we announced the acquisition of up to 67 stores from Julius Meinl a.s. in the Czech Republic. As of March√Ç¬†28, 2006, we have acquired 59 of these stores., 356247=The new remuneration policy eliminates the use of stock options as an equity reward method. Beginning in 2006, Ahold shares will instead be granted through a mid-term (three-year) and a long-term (five-year) conditional share grant program:, 172709=In 2005, competitive and operating cost pressures in our retail markets were greater than expected and the turnaround at some of our businesses was slower than planned. The financial targets we originally set for retail in 2003 have become increasingly challenging. Based on the retail trends we have seen so far in 2006, we expect our retail net sales growth this year to be between 2.5% and 3.0% (at constant exchange rates and excluding divestments made in 2005). In addition, we expect that our retail operating margin will be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2006. Our overall priority remains to drive top line growth and achieve a 5% retail operating margin., 300505=This annual report and the 2005 consolidated financial statements, audited by Deloitte Accountants B.V., have been presented to the Supervisory Board. The consolidated financial statements were discussed with the Audit Committee in the presence of the Corporate Executive Board and the external auditor. The Supervisory Board endorses this annual report. The Supervisory Board recommends that the General Meeting of Shareholders adopts the 2005 consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 231500=Jan Brouwer, 923205=Net income attributable to common shareholders of Ahold in 2005 was EUR 133√Ç¬†million, a significant decrease compared to EUR 885√Ç¬†million in 2004. This decrease in 2005 was primarily a result of the impact of the settlement of the Securities Class Action and the positive impact of EUR 379√Ç¬†million net gain related to the ICA put option transaction in 2004. For more information on the settlement of the Securities Class Action, see √Ç¬ìTotal Company operating expenses √Ç¬ñ Settlement securities class action√Ç¬î above and Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 682796=reduce indebtedness and, in January 2006, to pay litigation claims. The tables below summarize the status of our divestment program through January√Ç¬†1, 2006., 886357=Our operating income decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 mainly due to impact of the settlement of the Securities Class Action of EUR 803√Ç¬†million, which includes insurance proceeds. Our operating income in 2005 compared to 2004 was also negatively affected by the impact of the restructuring charges at U.S. Foodservice, which negative, 619730=ICA is an integrated food retail and wholesale group, headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. As of December√Ç¬†31, 2005, ICA served over 2,500 retailer-owned and company-operated supermarkets, neighborhood stores, hypermarkets and discount stores in Sweden, Norway and, through a joint venture, in the Baltic states. ICA also provides consumer financial services in Sweden through its bank., 394719=Each member of the Supervisory Board shall immediately report any potential conflict of interest to the chairman of the Supervisory Board. The member of the Supervisory Board with such conflict or potential conflict of interest shall provide the chairman of the Supervisory Board with all relevant information. The chairman of the Supervisory Board will determine whether there is a conflict of interest. If a member of the Supervisory Board has a conflict of interest with the Company, such member shall not participate in the discussions and/or decision making process on a subject or transaction in relation to which such member has a conflict of interest. In accordance with provision III.6.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code we report that in 2005 Jan Hommen did not take part in the discussions and abstained from voting on any matter related to the sale of three shopping centers in Central Europe to ING Real Estate in view of his membership of the supervisory board of ING Groep N.V. and provisions III.6.1 through III.6.3 were complied with. No other conflicts of interest occurred in 2005., 306212=The Remuneration Committee utilizes external and internal advisers from time to time for advice and information. In 2005 external advisers were hired to provide professional advice regarding our remuneration policy, remuneration market practices, and short and long-term incentive plans and practices. The Supervisory Board determines the remuneration of the individual members of the Corporate Executive Board within the limits of our remuneration policy. Our remuneration policy, in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code was adopted at the General Meeting of Shareholders on March√Ç¬†3, 2004., 1106712=decreased primarily due to the divestment of the Polish hypermarkets in the first quarter of 2005., 917289=Operating income of ICA in 2005 was positively impacted by higher net sales at ICA Sverige and ICA Meny, and also by higher volumes at ICA Banken as well as cost cuts at ICA Sverige and ICA Norge. Operating income in 2004 was positively impacted by the gain on the sale of ICA√Ç¬ís 50% interest in Statoil Detaljhandel and ICA√Ç¬ís share in income of Statoil Detaljhandel. Operating income in 2004 was, however, negatively impacted by the write-down to market value of the former Danish operations ISO-ICA A/S., 182468=In addition, we undertake activities that aim to advance the position of suppliers in the developing world. The Ahold Sustainable Trade Development program has brought fair trade and organic products from Africa to be sold in ICA and Albert Heijn stores.

The plan focused on four key areas: restoring our financial health; re-engineering our food retail business; recovering the value of U.S. Foodservice; and reinforcing accountability, controls and corporate governance., 940079=During the process of addressing of our material weaknesses, which no longer exist, we identified certain unintentional errors that were made in the determination of net income (loss) and shareholders√Ç¬í equity under US√Ç¬†GAAP for 2004. To correct these errors, we have restated the US√Ç¬†GAAP information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements with the effect of lowering net income by EUR 21 million. Errors relating to years prior to 2004 amounting to EUR 21√Ç¬†million have been adjusted as a reduction in opening equity of financial year 2004. In addition, the cumulative preferred financing shares, which under US√Ç¬†GAAP are considered equity instruments, have been reclassified to a separate class of equity, as required by EITF D-98.

The process of ensuring compliance with Section√Ç¬†404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require significant costs and time to complete. For a further discussion regarding our internal controls, see √Ç¬ìInternal control√Ç¬î in this annual report. Any failure to strengthen our internal controls could result in accounting errors or misstatements in our financial statements and could harm the reliability of our financial statements, which could in turn adversely affect investor confidence and the prices of our common shares and ADSs., 888080=impact was more than offset by lower impairments and integration expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 and higher gains on disposal of non-current assets in 2005 compared to 2004.

The decrease of net interest expense was mainly impacted by lower average outstanding debt balances as a result of debt repayments totaling EUR 2.3 billion during 2005 as well as the full year effect of debt repayments of EUR 1.5 billion in 2004.

During 2005, we have made significant progress in the preparation of design documentation and testing of operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. On the other hand, it should be noted that the status of SOx activities by the end of 2005 varies per arena, and certain required aspects for the SOx 404 evaluation have yet to be completed. The Corporate Executive Board expects that the control deficiencies identified through this process in 2005 can be solved timely through the current remediation program., 674486=In our 2002 annual report, we restated our financial position and results of operations for 2001 and 2000 as a result of the events we announced on February√Ç¬†24, 2003.

In connection with these IT outsourcing initiatives, it is possible that we may encounter unforeseen technical complexities that we may be unable to resolve, or that the resolution of such complexities may lead to delays in the implementation of these initiatives. Our management may be required to devote more attention than anticipated to matters related to these outsourcing initiatives, including matters related to internal controls and financial reporting.

We estimate our proportionate share of the total unfunded liability of these plans at EUR 637 million. These unfunded liabilities are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets because sufficient information is generally not available and the financial statements of these plans are not based on the same accounting standards according to which our consolidated financial statements are prepared. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. Our risk of such increased contributions may be greater if any of the participating employers in an underfunded multi-employer plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with the participants of the plan., 705847=We plan to introduce a family-focused range of homewares in the first half of 2007 in our retail arenas.

This high effective tax rate indicates that 84.4% of our loss before income taxes is offset by an income tax gain., 602539=U.S. Foodservice, acquired in 2000, focuses on supplying food and related products to:, 193731=In the Netherlands, Albert Heijn stores have introduced the new Healthy Choice Clover symbol on private brand products, making it easier for customers to identify healthy options.

Competitive and operating cost pressures have been greater than expected and the turnaround at certain businesses has been slower than planned. Based on the retail trends we have seen for the year to date, we expect our retail net sales growth this year to be between 2.5% and 3.0% (at constant exchange rates, and excluding divestments made in 2005). In addition, we expect that our retail operating margin will be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2006. Our overall priority remains to drive top line growth and achieve a 5% retail operating margin.

The decrease in operational results of the discontinued operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily a result of the inclusion in income from our discontinued operations in 2004 of the full-year results of BI-LO and Bruno√Ç¬ís, which we sold in January 2005. BI-LO and Bruno√Ç¬ís operating income in 2004 was somewhat offset by operating losses related to certain under-performing assets that we sold in 2004., 258069=Stephanie Shern was appointed to the Supervisory Board as of May√Ç¬†18, 2005.

We raised approximately EUR 2.9 billion in net equity proceeds, reduced gross debt by approximately EUR 5.8 billion, negotiated a new, unsecured syndicated EUR 2 billion credit facility with more favorable terms and conditions than the prior facility, completed divestments for cash consideration and assumed debt totaling EUR 3.1 billion. As a result of our efforts, we have improved our liquidity, strengthened our balance sheet and better positioned ourselves for the future by divesting non-core and under-performing assets., 703680=We plan to implement an arena-wide value improvement program at both Stop√Ç¬†& Shop and Giant-Landover. Starting in 2006, this program will be implemented over the next three years in phases applying a product category-by-category approach. This program has similar objectives to the value repositioning program that we have successfully implemented at Albert Heijn and ICA.

Under IFRS the share in income (loss) of our joint ventures and associates is required to be included in income before tax without a corresponding income tax expense effect. Because of our loss before income taxes in 2005, the application of IFRS contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate in 2005 compared to our 2004 income before income taxes, in which year the application of IFRS led to a reduction of our effective tax rate. Furthermore, a tax exempt capital gain of EUR 38√Ç¬†million with respect to the release of the D&S litigation provision had a positive impact on the effective tax rate in 2005, whereas additional valuation allowances related to loss carry-forwards in our Central Europe Arena had a negative impact on the effective tax rate in 2005., 10773=If this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section√Ç¬†13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†Yes √Ç¬®√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†No√Ç¬†√Ç¬†x, 240980=Stephanie Shern (January 7, 1948) is a U.S. national.

In 2004 we acquired an additional 20% interest in ICA (10% of which we transferred to our joint venture partner) pursuant to the exercise of a put option by one of the ICA partners. Our net financial expense in 2005 also increased as a result of an additional one-time loss of EUR 53√Ç¬†million relating to a bond buy back transaction in October 2005 and as a result of the EUR 39√Ç¬†million gain in 2004 relating to a derivative hedge that no longer qualified for hedge accounting., 453069=During the course of the closing and the annual audit of our 2004 financial statements two material weaknesses and a number of reportable conditions under the interim standards of the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as well as other internal control issues were identified.

In November 2004, we increased our interest in ICA to 60%. The other 40% interest in ICA is held by Hakon Invest AB, a Swedish company listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Under our shareholders agreement with Hakon Invest AB, our 60% shareholding interest in ICA does not entitle us to unilateral decision making authority over ICA, because the agreement provides that strategic, financial and operational decisions will be made only on the basis of mutual consent., 305883=In 2005, the Remuneration Committee met nine times. The CEO was invited to all of these meetings but did not attend all meetings.

The decrease was primarily a result of the de-consolidation of the Baltic operations and the sale of the Danish operations. Excluding the impacts of the de-consolidation of the Baltic operations and the sale of the Danish operations, net sales in SEK increased by 3.8% in 2005 compared to 2004. Net sales at ICA Sverige increased, primarily due to the successful value repositioning program. Net sales at ICA Norge decreased, primarily due to competition, divestments of stores and the conversion of company-operated stores to franchise stores., 36010=The selected financial data below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The selected financial data as of January√Ç¬†1, 2006 and January√Ç¬†2, 2005 and for the two years then ended have been derived from these consolidated financial statements.

The selected financial data as of December√Ç¬†28, 2003,√Ç¬†December√Ç¬†29, 2002 and December√Ç¬†30, 2001 and for the three years then ended have been derived from our consolidated financial statements not included in this annual report and are included in the selected financial data below under US√Ç¬†GAAP only., 726187=In 2006, our focus will be on a comprehensive review of underperforming assets and a reduction of corporate overhead., 849709=Our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the charge for the settlement of the Securities Class Action., 917888=ICA Sverige reported a lower operating income in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of the value repositioning program, the negative impact of which primarily occurred in the first two quarters in 2005 due to the timing of savings and costs. ICA Norge reported increased operating income in 2005 primarily as a result of cost cuts and higher gains on property sales. As reported by ICA, ICA Meny and ICA√Ç¬ís joint venture Rimi Baltic improved, 479407=U.S. Foodservice accounts for a substantial portion of our net sales. Although we are in the process of reorganizing U.S. Foodservice into two operating companies to restore its value and improve its profitability, our plan may not be successful.

We have made significant progress and implemented a number of initiatives and changes at U.S. Foodservice to clarify accountability, improve our internal controls and strengthen our corporate governance. In 2004, we implemented a plan focusing on organizational, operational and system improvements as well as procurement enhancements at U.S. Foodservice in order to restore profitability and cash flow. In 2005, we continued executing this plan, resulting in improved operating income at U.S. Foodservice, and in November of the same year announced a new long-term strategy., 372321=Each member of the Corporate Executive Board shall immediately report any potential conflict of interest to the chairman of the Supervisory Board and to the other members of the Corporate Executive Board. A member of the Corporate Executive Board with such conflict or potential conflict of interest must provide the chairman of the Supervisory Board and the other members of the Corporate Executive Board with all relevant information. The chairman of the Supervisory Board will determine whether there is a conflict of interest. If a member of the Corporate Executive Board has a conflict of interest with the Company, such member shall not participate in the discussions and/or decision making process on a subject or transaction in relation to which such member has a conflict of interest. The chairman of the Supervisory Board shall arrange for such transactions to be disclosed in the annual report. There were no conflicts of interest in 2005., 37777=Until 2004, we prepared our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (√Ç¬ìDutch GAAP√Ç¬î). As required by a EU regulation, from 2005 onwards our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. All standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the √Ç¬ìIASB√Ç¬î) effective for 2005 and all interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (the √Ç¬ìIFRIC√Ç¬î) effective for 2005 have been endorsed by the EU.

The Audit Committee received regular updates on internal controls and the progress on the project to comply with the requirements of Section√Ç¬†404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act as of December√Ç¬†31, 2006. The Audit Committee closely monitored the Company√Ç¬ís efforts to improve and strengthen its internal controls, including with respect to the two material weaknesses and other internal control issues which were reported in the 2004 annual report. The 2004 material weaknesses related to accounting for income tax provisions and to U.S. GAAP financial statement reconciliation process and no longer exist as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Every quarter a report from the whistleblower procedure was provided to the Audit Committee and discussed with the Corporate Executive Board in the meetings. Regularly the Audit Committee was informed on litigation and the related exposure. The Audit Committee was updated on IT whereby information strategy, information architecture, outsourcing, information management governance and information security were addressed. The Audit Committee assessed the independence and performance of the external auditor and for that purpose pre-approved the fees for audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the external auditors as, 344396=NEW REMUNERATION POLICY 2006 2, 412157=Any shares held by us or our subsidiaries in our own capital may not be voted. An acquisition by us of shares in our capital of any class must be approved by resolution of our Corporate Executive Board, subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board. Shares in our own capital may only be acquired if the General Meeting of Shareholders has authorized our Corporate Executive Board to do so. Such authority may apply for a maximum period of 18 months and must specify the number of shares that may be acquired, the manner in which shares may be acquired and the price limits within which shares may be acquired. No such authority is required for the acquisition by us of fully paid shares in our own capital for the purpose of transferring these shares to our employees or employees of a group company pursuant to our share plans or option plans, provided the shares are quoted in the official price list of a stock exchange. Our Corporate Executive Board has been authorized to acquire shares through November√Ç¬†18, 2006, subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board. As of the date of this annual report, we have not acquired any shares under this authorization., 835803=The following table sets forth our operating expenses by category for 2005 and 2004:, 675676=The additional week in 2004 also had a significant impact on our results of operations in 2005. Our 2005 results compared to 2004 were negatively affected by the fact that 2004 on a consolidated basis and for many of our operations consisted of 53 weeks, while 2005 consisted of 52 weeks. This is not applicable for Ahold√Ç¬ís operations in the Central Europe Arena and the joint ventures and associates. The financial year for these entities corresponds to the calendar year. For a discussion of our financial years, including year-end dates, see √Ç¬ìGeneral information√Ç¬î in this annual report. For a reconciliation of net sales excluding week 53 of 2004, see √Ç¬ìReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures√Ç¬î below. Our retail business generally experiences an increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of each year (which in 2004 included week 53), primarily as a result of the holiday season., 862075=We recorded a gain on the disposal of non-current assets of EUR 52√Ç¬†million in 2005, compared to a gain of EUR 15√Ç¬†million in 2004.

We also made a voluntary funding of EUR 236√Ç¬†million to our pension program in the U.S. These transactions all utilized available cash balances. Our improved liquidity position and stronger balance sheet enabled us in February 2005 to terminate our three-year revolving December 2003 credit facility (the √Ç¬ìDecember 2003 Credit Facility√Ç¬î). In May 2005, Ahold signed a new five-year EUR 2 billion unsecured syndicated multi-currency credit facility (the √Ç¬ìMay 2005 Credit Facility√Ç¬î) with a syndicate of banks having more favorable terms and conditions than the December 2003 Credit Facility. The new credit facility is intended to be used for general corporate purposes and for the issuance of letters of credit and remained undrawn except for EUR 588√Ç¬†million (USD 696 million) utilized for letters of credit at the end of 2005. For further details and information, see Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and √Ç¬ìLiquidity and capital resources - Assessment of liquidity and capital resources.√Ç¬î, 863122=Our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily because of the charge of EUR 803√Ç¬†million in operating income, which includes insurance proceeds, for the agreement to settle the Securities Class Action. Under the terms of the settlement agreement in the Securities Class Action, the lead plaintiffs agree to settle all claims in the Securities Class Action against Ahold, its subsidiaries, the individual defendants and the underwriters for the sum of USD 1.1 billion (EUR 937 million). This amount includes USD 9√Ç¬†million (EUR 8 million) as compensation to the VEB for facilitating the global settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. Excluding the impact of the settlement, net of the insurance proceeds, our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2005 compared to 2004. For more information on the settlement of the Securities Class Action, see Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 175669=We expect that U.S. Foodservice√Ç¬ís operating margin in U.S. dollars before impairment of goodwill will exceed 1.7% no later than 2006., 136422=2003, 220866=Peter Wakkie (June 22, 1948) is a Dutch national.

We have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the two material weaknesses reported in our 2004 Annual Report no longer exist. For additional information, see √Ç¬ìCorporate governance√Ç¬î and √Ç¬ìInternal control√Ç¬î., 851271=Our general and administrative expenses decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily because of the one-time costs of USD 54√Ç¬†million (EUR 44 million) in 2004 related to the integration of Giant-Landover, Stop√Ç¬†& Shop and the U.S. retail support service. Our net payments to AIG Europe (the Netherlands) N.V. in connection with the settlement of insurance coverage litigation with respect to a director√Ç¬ís and officer√Ç¬ís liability insurance policy issued by AIG for Ahold and U.S. Foodservice were USD 31.5√Ç¬†million (EUR 25.5 million), both in 2005 and 2004., 853295=Our amortization of intangible assets decreased by EUR 24√Ç¬†million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of lower amortization in the Stop√Ç¬†& Shop/Giant-Landover Arena., 681909=In 2003, we announced our intention to generate at least EUR 2.5 billion of gross proceeds by divesting non-core businesses and under-performing assets by the end of 2005. For these purposes, √Ç¬ìgross proceeds√Ç¬î means cash consideration and assumed debt. We have succeeded in our mission and by the end of 2005, the aggregate gross proceeds from the divestments amounted to EUR 3.1 billion. Of this amount, EUR 1.6 billion was generated in 2005, EUR 1.1 billion in 2004 and EUR 0.4 billion in 2003 resulting in net cash from the divestment of consolidated subsidiaries of EUR 1,058√Ç¬†million in 2005, EUR 978√Ç¬†million in 2004 and EUR 284√Ç¬†million in 2003. We applied the cash received from our divestments to, 253904=The Supervisory Board was regularly updated on the major legal proceedings and held a special meeting to approve the settlement in the securities class action.

It is the last of our outstanding material litigations with significant financial exposure from that time., 854499=Our impairment losses relating to goodwill increased by EUR√Ç¬†19√Ç¬†million in 2005 compared to 2004.

Ahold will change its segment reporting to reflect these changes in financial reporting starting in the first quarter of 2006., 258856=The members that joined the Supervisory Board in 2005 attended a full-day induction program at our offices in Zaandam or Amsterdam. Senior management briefed the members of the Supervisory Board on their responsibilities as members of the Supervisory Board and the financial, legal and reporting affairs of the Company and its businesses. Members of the Supervisory Board visited several arenas and other parts of the business during the year., 133952=2001, 696839=In November 2003, we launched a program of strategic business cost saving initiatives aimed at improving our competitiveness. These initiatives are expected to lower costs related to sourcing, information technology, supply chain and store operations. Our arenas and operating companies share responsibility for the initiatives together with our Business Support Office (the √Ç¬ìBSO√Ç¬î).

These events led to a number of investigations and legal proceedings. For a further discussion of these investigations and legal proceedings, see Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 1020710=and 10 of the 31 eastern New York stores planned for divestment were closed or sold in 2005., 258313=Benno Hoogendoorn was appointed to the Supervisory Board as of May√Ç¬†18, 2005.

Our core values are rooted in Ahold√Ç¬ís heritage and reflect our ambitions for the future. Increasing the focus on our core capabilities will help us build upon what we do best and differentiate us from the competition., 11589=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)√Ç¬†has filed all reports required to be filed by Section√Ç¬†13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)√Ç¬†has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†Yes√Ç¬†√Ç¬†x√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†No√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬®, 237374=Jan Hommen (April 29, 1943) is a Dutch national.

She is a member of the board of Jaakko P√É¬∂yry Group Oyj and director of Lonmin Plc and of Merrill Lynch New Energy Technology Plc., 488056=Relating to the events in early 2003, Moody√Ç¬ís Investors Services (√Ç¬ìMoody√Ç¬ís√Ç¬î) and Standard√Ç¬†& Poor√Ç¬ís Ratings Services (√Ç¬ìS&P√Ç¬î) downgraded our credit ratings to below investment grade ratings. As part of our strategy to restore our financial health, we are focused on working towards meeting the applicable investment grade ratings criteria. During 2004 and 2005, both Moody√Ç¬ís and S&P upgraded our credit ratings, but such credit ratings remain below investment grade. While none of our material credit facilities or other debt instruments contain direct events of default that are triggered by credit rating downgrades, a downgrade of our long-term debt rating by either Moody√Ç¬ís or S&P could raise liquidity concerns, reduce our flexibility in accessing a broad array of funding sources and increase our costs of borrowing, which could result in our inability to secure new financing or affect our ability to make payments on outstanding debt instruments and comply with other existing obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the applicable investment grade rating criteria, particularly if our operating strategy and objectives are not successful. For a further discussion of our credit ratings, see √Ç¬ìManagement√Ç¬ís discussion√Ç¬†& analysis√Ç¬ñLiquidity and capital resources√Ç¬î and Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 994743=18 stores as part of its store upgrade program over the next two years. In addition, health care costs are expected to increase in 2006., 921060=In 2005, our result on divestments decreased compared to 2004. In 2005, we realized a gain of EUR 172√Ç¬†million on the divestments of Paiz Ahold, Deli XL, G. Barbosa, BI-LO and Bruno√Ç¬ís, compared to a gain on divestments of EUR 238√Ç¬†million in 2004 relating to the divestments of Bompre√É¬ßo / Hipercard, Disco and our operations in Spain and Thailand., 416984=No cumulative preferred shares are currently outstanding. We entered into an option agreement with Stichting Ahold Continu√É¬Øteit (√Ç¬ìSAC√Ç¬î) designed to exercise influence with respect to a potential change in control over us. SAC is a Dutch foundation whose statutory purpose is to enhance our continuity, independence and identity in case of a hostile takeover attempt. As of March√Ç¬†28, 2006, the members of the board of SAC were:, 850293=Our selling expenses and selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 because of increased selling expenses of in some of our arenas, particularly selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the Central Europe Arena and at Schuitema. The increase in the Central Europe Arena was primarily a result of higher net sales, various project costs and a write-off of supplier receivables and inventories related to stock-taking differences. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales in the Albert Heijn Arena, primarily as a result of cost reductions and efficiency improvements with respect to logistic and transportation expenses., 477614=For 2006 and onward, we have defined a growth strategy based on core values that our operating companies share and core capabilities that we are improving. In 2005, competitive and operating cost pressures in our retail markets were greater than expected and the turnaround at certain of our businesses was slower than planned. The financial targets we originally set for retail in 2003 have become increasingly challenging. Based on the retail trends we have seen so far in 2006, we expect our retail net sales growth in 2006 to be between 2.5% and 3.0% (assuming constant currency exchange rates and excluding divestments made in 2005). In addition, we expect that our retail operating margin will be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2006. Our overall priority remains to drive net sales growth and achieve a retail operating margin of 5%. We may encounter difficulties or delays in implementing our strategic initiatives and we may not be able to achieve the expected retail net sales growth and retail operating margin. We may also incur unanticipated costs in implementing our strategy. We have planned certain levels of capital expenditures and launched several strategic initiatives for our food retail business. These include initiatives that we expect will allow us to realize gross cost savings aggregating approximately EUR 650√Ç¬†million by the end of 2006. However, we may not be able to reach the targeted levels or receive the expected benefits of these cost savings and capital expenditures. If we do not successfully carry out our strategy with respect to our food retail business, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity., 481976=We have significantly reduced our debt as part of our Road to Recovery strategy. However, we continue to have substantial indebtedness and our total gross debt at the end of 2005 was approximately EUR 7.7 billion. In addition to the obligations recorded on our balance sheet, we also have various commitments and contingent liabilities that may result in significant future cash requirements. Although some of our debt instruments and other arrangements place conditions on our incurring further debt, we are not barred from doing so. To the extent we incur incremental debt, our leverage risk will increase. Our significant level of debt could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including but not limited to, the following:, 711538=In November 2005, we announced our strategic plan focused on pursuing profitable sales growth at U.S. Foodservice. The strategic plan includes the following initiatives:, 144056=November 2005, 697460=cost savings program in 2003, facilitates the development of the various initiatives., 146503=March 2006, 696321=On August√Ç¬†1, 2005 we announced our plans to grow our business in key markets through selective acquisitions. On the same day we announced the acquisition of up to 67 stores from Julius Meinl a.s. in the Czech Republic. As of March√Ç¬†28, 2006, we have acquired 59 of these stores., 356247=The new remuneration policy eliminates the use of stock options as an equity reward method. Beginning in 2006, Ahold shares will instead be granted through a mid-term (three-year) and a long-term (five-year) conditional share grant program:, 172709=In 2005, competitive and operating cost pressures in our retail markets were greater than expected and the turnaround at some of our businesses was slower than planned. The financial targets we originally set for retail in 2003 have become increasingly challenging. Based on the retail trends we have seen so far in 2006, we expect our retail net sales growth this year to be between 2.5% and 3.0% (at constant exchange rates and excluding divestments made in 2005). In addition, we expect that our retail operating margin will be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2006. Our overall priority remains to drive top line growth and achieve a 5% retail operating margin., 300505=This annual report and the 2005 consolidated financial statements, audited by Deloitte Accountants B.V., have been presented to the Supervisory Board. The consolidated financial statements were discussed with the Audit Committee in the presence of the Corporate Executive Board and the external auditor. The Supervisory Board endorses this annual report. The Supervisory Board recommends that the General Meeting of Shareholders adopts the 2005 consolidated financial statements included in this annual report., 231500=Jan Brouwer, 923205=Net income attributable to common shareholders of Ahold in 2005 was EUR 133√Ç¬†million, a significant decrease compared to EUR 885√Ç¬†million in 2004. This decrease in 2005 was primarily a result of the impact of the settlement of the Securities Class Action and the positive impact of EUR 379√Ç¬†million net gain related to the ICA put option transaction in 2004.

By the middle of the 1964 football season she was gone and so were the all-black uniforms. Eleanor Lineman had returned to get the Steelerettes back on track and the first order of business was new uniforms. Our ONLY compensation was a couple of complimentary tickets to each game, so a second uniform was out of the question, unless the girls made their own. Never underestimate the determination and resourcefulness of a group of 17 and 18 year old girls. A pattern was purchased along with some material and each girl sewed her own uniform for the second half of the season. Being a Steelerette was about the best fun anyone could have, but it was also a lot of hard work. Practice was held after school nearly every day and Saturday workouts lasted four and five hours. Those precision routines don't just happen by accident. Our feet hurt, our muscles ached and just when we thought we had given all we had to give, Eleanor would yell ""Come on girls, let's do it ONE MORE TIME! Keep those toes pointed, and remember, SMILE, SMILE, SMILE!"" Frequently, smiling was the last thing we wanted to do.

Whether they√¢¬Ä¬ôre serving lunch to seniors, raising funds for Del Oro√¢¬Ä¬ôs Aquatic Center, or clearing trees, trash and even rattlesnakes from an elderly lady√¢¬Ä¬ôs property, Loomis Sunset Rotarians enjoy giving back to the community by practicing the Rotarian ideal of √¢¬Ä¬úService Above Self,√¢¬Ä? according to club president Dustin Ogden. √¢¬Ä¬úYou will not find a group of people so willing to help others, have fun doing it and help each other rise as the Rotarians,√¢¬Ä? said Louise Dutton, an original member who first became involved with Rotary through their Group Study Exchange program in 1994 and visited Japan. √Ç¬†√¢¬Ä¬úThe dynamics of the group are amazing. They like to do lots of things and there is so much goodwill going on during their projects that it doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt feel like service,√¢¬Ä? Dutton said. The local chapter of Rotary International √¢¬Ä¬ì a service organization with 1.2 million members worldwide known for eradicating polio √¢¬Ä¬ì began meeting two and a half years ago and was chartered last February. The club is very active locally and internationally with about 25 members who range in age, ethnicity, professions and reasons for being part of the club, Ogden said. Last April, members participated in Rotarian Work Day by cleaning up the five-acre parcel of a local 90-year-old woman who had just come home from the hospital. Cristie Akers, who helped found the club with her husband, Allan Frumkin, said, √¢¬Ä¬úWe completely weeded her property, got rid of about eight rattlesnakes, cleared out all the garbage, including three old mowers, cut some trees down, and took about four trailer-loads to the Loomis Spring Clean-up Day at Del Oro.√¢¬Ä? In July, the club sponsored their inaugural annual fundraiser, the Loomis Live street dance, to benefit Friends of the Del Oro Aquatic Center. √¢¬Ä¬úWe began preparing for the event by working to bring the Blue Anchor Stage up to code, and spent one Saturday demolishing the old wooden outdoor stage and another helping to rebuild it with composite decking material,√¢¬Ä? Ogden said. The club often works with other organizations. In October, they helped Girl Scout Troop 200 spruce up Loomis Basin Charter School, where they donate a library book on behalf of each speaker who addresses their meetings. They also donated funds to For Us Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit which distributes water filters in South America and Africa, founded by Del Oro grad and club member Carrie Beth Bowin. In November, they prepared and served lunch at the Senior L.I.F.E Center in Loomis, and will continue doing so quarterly. In December, they partnered with AT&T Pioneers to take food and Christmas gifts to needy children in Marysville/Yuba City. This year, the club plans to add more projects. They are writing grants for matching funds from Rotary International to donate more water filters and work on an international project with For One Another Foundation, Inc. They are also looking into working with patients at U.C. Davis Children√¢¬Ä¬ôs Hospital and helping Foothills Habitat for Humanity with some rehab projects, said Anna Lester, the club√¢¬Ä¬ôs service chairperson. √¢¬Ä¬úIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs a very diverse group and what works so well is that we do like to laugh and have a lot of fun. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve heard from many other Rotarians that we are such a unique group, they love coming to visit us,√¢¬Ä? she said. The group meets every Tuesday from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. at the Indian Creek Golf Club in Loomis.

The first Jews settled in the city in the beginning of the 19th century, but until the end of the century they numbered very few. In the second half of the 19th century they took part in the development of the glass and porcelain industry. In 1886/87 Ludwig (Zelig) Sunderland established a glass factory equipped with state of the art machinery and soon controlled the entire glass industry in the area. The factory employed 40 workers, mostly Jewish. The development of industry in the area brought about an increase in the Jewish population of Ilza. In addition to the factory, Jews owned 3 flourmills, 5 gypsum quarries and 10 various trade workshops.

In 1923, 18 million (inflationary) Marks were collected under the auspices of the Zionist Shekel program. Approximately 200 individuals purchased the Shekel in 1930.

Towards the end of the 30's Zionist support waned. In the 20th Zionist congress (1937) only 22 delegates participated.

Post-stroke hemiparesis is often marked by persistent hand impairment, which adversely affects both a person's ability to work and his/her quality of life. We believe that impairment is primarily due to neural, rather than biomechanical, factors. At the muscle level, these factors relate either to the inability to activate muscles (i.e., low muscle activation) or to activate them appropriately (i.e., abnormal muscle co-activation). Currently it is unclear as to which one is largely responsible for weakness in the hand as the net mechanical effect, e.g., reduced fingertip force production, could be the same. Determination of voluntary muscle force generation could help to explain deficits in fingertip force production in specific directions, as well as to customize treatment approaches in which force generation ability of some muscles is decreased and others increased. The goal of this work is to explain the source of neurally-mediated weakness at the fingertip following hemiparetic stroke, and to design and experimentally test rehabilitation interventions that attempt to offset this weakness. As we were refining the protocol to experimentally test a rehabilitation intervention√¢¬Ä¬îinvolving neural block and stimulation of select muscles to decrease and increase muscle force generation√¢¬Ä¬îit was more challenging than anticipated to locate, using ultrasound, small nerve branches to individual muscles for selective neural blocking.

However, the impact of providing treatment is less than optimal because offenders often fail to follow through on treatment referrals, leave treatment early, or have poor engagement in treatment activities. In particular, participation in prison-based treatment alone is seldom effective in reducing drug use or recidivism unless it is followed by participation in community treatment. For correctional systems that provide a continuum of care model from prison to community, low rates of admission and retention result in poor outcomes and poor resource utilization. One way to address this problem is to provide incentives to parolees for community treatment participation. Although research supports the effectiveness of behavioral reinforcement, mainly in the form of contingency management (CM), for general substance abuse populations, CM has not yet been tested or adapted for use in community-based programs for offender populations, particularly to encourage treatment attendance. In addition, recent research has documented elevated rates of HIV infection among incarcerated populations compared to the general population, with prevalence of HIV among inmates in US prisons being estimated to be 6 to 10 times higher than in the general population. Upon release from prison, parolees often immediately resume high-risk behaviors that they engaged in prior to incarceration. Because of the",False,-1,0,,,

But back then, that was the first time that we'd seen a new generation of consoles, and it was really difficult to predict what was going to happen.

Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II√¢¬Ä?√¢¬Ä¬ä'√¢¬Ä¬ãs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities.

Most countries have strict water regulations and legislation to minimise the occurrence of such poisoning cases.[12][13][14] Heavy metal pollution[edit] Pacific oysters are nonspecific filter feeders, which means they ingest any particulate matter in the water column.[10] This presents major issues for virus management of open water shellfish farms, as shellfish like the Pacific oyster have been found to contain norovirus strains which can be harmful to humans.[10] Globally, noroviruses are the most common cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis, and are introduced into the water column by faecal matter, either from sewage discharge or land runoff from nearby farmland.[10] Numerous gastroenteritis outbreaks in the world have been directly caused","[9] Predators[edit] Numerous predators are known to damage Pacific oyster stocks.[15] Several crab species (Metacarcinus magister, Cancer productus, Metacarcinus gracilis), oyster drills and starfish species (Pisater ochraceus, P. brevispinus, Evasterias troschelii and Pycnopodia helianthoides) can cause severe impacts to oyster culture.[15] Productivity[edit] Productivity of the Pacific oyster can be discussed as the amount of meat produced in relation to the amount of seed planted on cultch.[5] The productivity of a farm also depends on the interaction of biotic factors, such as mortality, growth, and oyster size, as well as the quality of the seed and the growing technique used (off bottom, bottom, suspended or floating culture).[5] The main causes of mortality in the Pacific oystere are: natural mortality (age), predators, disease, environmental conditions (ice, freak winds), competition for space (crowding of cultch), silting (sediment runoff from land) and cluster separation (process of breaking up clusters of oysters to into as many individual oysters as possible).

A few years later, Pacific oysters were the dominant species in the farms, as it grew three times faster than the rock oyster, produced a reliable and constant supply of spat, and had an already established market overseas. In 1977, the Pacific oyster was accidentally introduced to the Marlborough Sounds, and farming began there in the 1990s. Marlborough farmers developed a different method of cultivation in comparison to the North Island method of racks; they instead suspended their oysters on longlines., 36209=Global production has increased from about 150 tonnes in 1950 to 750 tonnes in 1980.[9] By 2003, global production had increased to 4.38 million tonnes.[9] The majority was in China, which produced 84% of the global production.[9] Japan, France and the Republic of Korea also contributed, producing 261 000, 238 000 and 115 000 tonnes produce, respectively.[9] The other two major producers are the United States (43 000 tonnes) and Taiwan (23 000 tonnes).[9] In 2003, global Pacific oyster production was worth $ 3.69 billion, with Asia contributing over half of this amount.[9], 48964=The Pacific oyster is one of the three main aquaculture species in New Zealand along with king salmon and the greenshell mussels.[18] Pacific oyster aquaculture production has grown from an export value of $11 million in 1986 to $32 million in 2006.[18] In 2006, the 23 Pacific oyster farms throughout New Zealand covered a total of 750 hectares of marine space and produced 2,800 tonnes of product per year.[16] Annual production is now between about 3,300 and 4,000 tonnes.[17] In 2005, the value of New Zealand's Pacific oyster production was $12 million domestically, and $16.9 million for export.[19] New Zealand√¢¬Ä¬ôs main export markets are Japan, Korea, the US, the EU and Australia.[19], 20626=Crassostrea gigas was named by a Swedish naturalist, Carl Peter Thunberg in 1795.[4] It originated from Japan, where it has been cultured for hundreds of years.[4] It is now the most widely farmed and commercially important oyster in the world, as it is very easy to grow, environmentally tolerant and is easily spread from one area to another.[4] The most significant introductions were to the Pacific Coast of the United States in the 1920s and to France in 1966.[4] In most places, the Pacific oyster was introduced to replace the native oyster stocks which were seriously dwindling due to overfishing or disease.[4] In addition, this species was introduced to create an industry that was previously not available at all in that area.[4] As well as intentional introductions, the Pacific oyster has spread through accidental introductions either through larvae in ballast water or on the hulls of ships.[4] In some places in the world, though, it is considered by Bio security, Primary Industry, and Conservation departments and ministries to be an invasive species, where it is outcompeting native species, such as the Olympia oyster in Puget Sound, Washington, the rock oyster, Saccostrea commercialis in the North Island of New Zealand and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, in the Wadden Sea.[citation needed]}",,"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 18:31:11 GMT"

This move fueled speculation that Jackson would be replacing Isiah Thomas as coach of the New York Knicks. However, Jackson claimed that the rumors were untrue and the decision was based on desire to stop commuting from Los Angeles and the fact that he continued to have a contract with ABC.[4] Rumors however, kept swirling around of Jackson returning to New York as coach of the failing Knicks. Those rumors, however, were dispelled with the Knicks' hiring of former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni., 32045=Jackson married singer and actress Desiree Coleman on July 29, 1990.[3] The couple has 4 children,[10] and currently lives in Los Angeles.

He was the first head coach hired by new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber. After inheriting a team that had made the playoffs just once in the previous 17 years, Jackson promised to turn the Warriors into a good defensive team and playoff contender.[5] However, he struggled to a 23√¢¬Ä¬ì43 record in his first year during the lockout-shortened 2011√¢¬Ä¬ì12 season as the team suffered several injuries to key players while adjusting to a new system. In the 2012√¢¬Ä¬ì13 season, however, with strong plays from Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Jackson led the Warriors to a 47√¢¬Ä¬ì35 record and a sixth place seeding in the Western Conference. It was the first time the Warriors had made the playoffs since the 2006√¢¬Ä¬ì07 season. The Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets 4√¢¬Ä¬ì2 in the first round of NBA Playoffs, but lost to the San Antonio Spurs 4√¢¬Ä¬ì2 in the Conference Semifinals.[6], 18384=In 1989, Jackson had another promising season for the Knicks, teaming with Ewing to lead them to the Atlantic Division title and the number two seed in the east (behind the eventual world champion Detroit Pistons, whom they swept 4-0 in the regular season), and making his lone All-Star Game appearance. After sweeping Charles Barkley's Philadelphia team in the opening round, the Knicks faced the upstart Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan, in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Noteworthy in the series was near the end of game two, where Jackson en route to a fast break layup in the fourth quarter looked back and stuck out his tongue at Jordan before finishing the layup; Jordan responded with a 40+ PPG average the remainder of the series, and led Chicago to a 4-2 series victory. Following a contract extension prior to the 1990 season, Jackson began to lose his All-Star form; the loss of Pitino (who left to coach the University of Kentucky) and starting the season out of shape were key factors. Consequently, he began to face stiff competition from backup guard Rod Strickland, to the point where in their decisive first round game five against Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden, Knick coach Stu Jackson decided to bench Mark Jackson for the entire game; New York went on to defeat Boston to advance to the second round, where they lost to the eventual champion Detroit Pistons in five games., 11657=On May 17, 2014, Jackson reached a multiyear agreement to return to ESPN as a game analyst.[1], 21919=Jackson later was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Pooh Richardson, Malik Sealy, and the draft rights to Eric Piatkowski. With the Pacers, he teamed with Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Antonio Davis and Dale Davis for six seasons to make the Indiana Pacers a contender. Jackson was traded to the Denver Nuggets before the 1996√¢¬Ä¬ì97 NBA season started for Jalen Rose. This trade was a disaster for the Pacers, as the Pacers fell in 10th place in the East halfway through the season and out of the playoff race. Feeling the heat, Pacers GM Donnie Walsh re-traded for Jackson at the deadline, giving up Vincent Askew, Eddie Johnson and a couple of 2nd round picks. The return of Jackson sparked the Pacers, but they still missed the playoffs for the only time in the last decade and a half. Jackson would eventually appear in his only NBA Finals as the Pacers' starting point guard in 2000, when they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games., 34934=In June 2012, Jackson revealed that he had been the target of an extortion threat based on an extramarital affair and nude photos taken in 2006. Jackson said that he initially made payments of several thousands of dollars to a stripper and her accomplice to keep quiet about the affair and the photos, but when the alleged extortionists increased their demands Jackson went to the FBI, and ultimately the alleged conspirators were named in felony criminal complaints. ""I recognize the extremely poor judgment that I used both in having an affair six years ago--including the embarrassing communication I exhibited during that time,"" said Jackson, ""and in attempting to deal with the extortion scheme at first by myself.""[18], 24250=In the offseason, he was involved in a trade back to the Nuggets, where he was immediately waived. Jackson played for the Utah Jazz for the 02-03 season as John Stockton's backup. It was this season that Jackson moved to second place on the list of all time assists leaders behind his teammate Stockton. Jackson would play every single game that season without starting one before moving on as a member of the Houston Rockets in 2004. Jackson only played in 42 games as a Rocket and, experiencing a large drop off in skills, finished his career at season's end., 17392=Jackson had a steady career with the Knicks, most notably under coach Rick Pitino, averaging 13.6 points and 10.6 assists per game in his rookie season, earning him the 1988 Rookie of the Year award, the lowest overall draft pick to win the award since Woody Sauldsberry in 1958. He is the only non-lottery pick to have won the award since the introduction of the system in 1985., 30144=Originally signed under a four-year, $8 million contract, Jackson earned two more years guaranteed on his contract in 2013, thus putting him under contract through 2014√¢¬Ä¬ì15.[7] The following season, the Warriors improved to 51√¢¬Ä¬ì31, the team's first season with 50 or more wins since 1993√¢¬Ä¬ì94.[8] They reached the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1992. However, the Warriors lost the first round of the playoffs to the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. On May 6, 2014, Jackson was removed as head coach of the Warriors. The Warriors front office stated the team was better than when Jackson first arrived, but felt a different coach was needed for the Warriors to win an NBA championship.[5][9], 20400=After the 1991√¢¬Ä¬ì92 season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, a trade that saw Charles Smith and Doc Rivers go to the Knicks. (This was actually a three-team deal, with the Clippers also obtaining Stanley Roberts from the Orlando Magic for draft picks; Roberts had become superfluous in Orlando when the Magic won the draft lottery for his college teammate, Shaquille O'Neal.) While with the Clippers, Jackson teamed with Danny Manning, Ron Harper and head coach Larry Brown to lead the Clippers to the second of their two consecutive playoff appearances; the Clippers would not reach the playoffs in consecutive years again until the 2011√¢¬Ä¬ì2012 and 2012√¢¬Ä¬ì2013 seasons., 9673=Mark A. Jackson (born April 1, 1965) is an American former NBA player and former basketball coach. A point guard from St. John's University, he played for the New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets in the NBA in a career spanning from 1987 to 2004., 16631=Jackson was the 18th pick of the 1987 NBA draft by the New York Knicks.[3] He teamed with Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley to turn the Knicks into a prime playoff team in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, before the Knicks peaked and became regular playoff contenders, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1992., 10736=After retiring from playing basketball, Jackson became a broadcast commentator for ESPN and ABC alongside his former coach Jeff Van Gundy and play-by-play man Mike Breen. He also worked as an analyst for The YES Network's New Jersey Nets games. In 2011, the Golden State Warriors hired Jackson as head coach. He coached the team for three seasons, but was fired in 2014 despite leading the Warriors to consecutive playoff appearances for the first time in over 20 years.}",,"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:31:43 GMT"

Kako bi se dobila godina republikanskog razdoblja treba oduzeti 1792 od godine u razdoblju izme√Ñ¬ëu 1. sije√Ñ?nja i 22. ili 23. rujna odnosno 1791. do kraja prosinca. Na primjer, kraj 2013. godine bio bi 222. godina (2013-1791=222)., 23966=Kalendar je oblikovao politi√Ñ?ar i agronom Charles Gilbert Romme, premda ga obi√Ñ?no pripisuju pjesniku Fabre d'√É¬âglantine-u, koji je izmislio imena mjeseci.

Na osnovi tog doga√Ñ¬ëaja u marksisti√Ñ?ki rje√Ñ?nik u√Ö¬°ao je izraz ""termidorski"" za revolucionare koji uni√Ö¬°tavaju revoluciju iznutra i okre√Ñ¬áu se protiv njenih pravih ciljeva. Npr. Trocki i njegove prista√Ö¬°e rabili su taj naziv za Staljina., 13187=Gilbert Rome je 19√Ç¬†Flor√É¬©al√Ç¬†An√Ç¬†III (8. svibnja 1795.) u ime Odbora javnog obrazovanja predlo√Ö¬æio fiksno aritmeti√Ñ?ko pravilo za odre√Ñ¬ëivanje prijestupnih godina. Njime je bila predvi√Ñ¬ëena primjena istog pravila kao u gregorijanskom kalendaru (da godine djeljive s 4 budu prijestupne, osim ve√Ñ¬áine djeljivih sa 100), samo da godina 4000. (posljednja godina desetog √Ñ?etiristogodi√Ö¬°njeg Razdoblja) bude prosta umjesto prijestupna. Po√Ö¬°to ovaj prijedlog nikada nije prihva√Ñ¬áen, nastavilo se s prvobitnim astronomskim pravilom, koje je isklju√Ñ?ivalo bilo kakvo aritmeti√Ñ?ko pravilo. Prijedlogom je trebalo izbje√Ñ¬ái neke neizvjesne prijestupne godine izazvane neprecizno√Ö¬°√Ñ¬áu astronomskog znanja 1790-ih (ovo √Ñ?ak i danas ima smisla zbog neizvjesnosti u √é¬îT). Npr. Odbor je zamijetio kako √Ñ¬áe ravnodnevica godine 144. biti u ""11:59:40 popodne"", √Ö¬°to je mnogo bli√Ö¬æe pono√Ñ¬ái od 3 ili 4 minute inherentne neizvjesnosti.}","Sat, 27 Jun 2015 01:36:34 GMT"

A lot has changed, though, and she's no longer a major-label darling, and her latest album, Coal, on the independent Captain Potato imprint, is exactly the kind of release she wouldn't have been allowed to do earlier in her career when everything hinged on delivering a radio hit or two or three. Coal is a heartfelt examination of the hard, often dangerous life of coal miners, and includes classic mining songs by the likes of Merle Travis, Hazel Dickens, and Jean Ritchie all arranged in a delicate, muted acoustic style by Mattea and her producer this time out, Marty Stuart. Mattea grew up in West Virginia, and while her father escaped the mines, both her grandfathers were miners, so when the 2006 Sago Mine disaster hit, which left 12 good men dead, she made up her mind to record this sparse, striking album.

Some street food is ok, especially in more rural areas, but not so much in Kowloon -- unless it's mostly Chinese eating there then it's probably OK More food advice from another expat:  If you can get to the Sheung Wan area (toward the west of Hong Kong island) you should find plenty of down to earth Cantonese food, dim sum style. Plenty of good snack outlets in Mong Kok area too (see if you can handle 'stinky tofu'). Also the various wet markets tend to have good casual places to eat. Word of warning - if you want to go somewhere that's been highly recommended recently there will probably be a massive queue, HK is very trend driven.

The Algodones Dunes in Southern California stretch across more than two hundred square miles and are visited by more than 1.4 million people each year, most of whom use some sort of off-road vehicle. A state highway splits the northern part of the dune field between wilderness and recreational area, but the task of monitoring the usage creates problems of its own. In stark contrast, the Gran Desierto Dunes are characterized by magnificent isolation. Located in Mexico, these dunes lie within a biosphere reserve and are further protected from large crowds by a nearly inaccessible road built essentially from well-placed trash and old tires. See firsthand why this dune system is known for its unique formations created by the constantly shifting winds and how the native plants adapt to the unpredictable gusts. Finally, visit Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in southern Utah and become a track detective to learn what stories can be told by animal tracks left in the sand.

Die h√É¬§ufigsten Zufallsf√É¬§nge sind Rotbarsch, Seeteufel, Steinbeisser, diverse Haie, Rochen, Conger, Heilbutt, Scholle, Fl√É¬ºgelbutt, Hornhecht, Goldlachs, Lippfische, vereinzelt Meerforellen und viele weitere Arten. Ein Tipp zum Schluss: Auch vom Steg oder in den umliegenden Forellenseen k√É¬∂nnen√Ç¬†sch√É¬∂ne F√É¬§nge gemacht werden! Makrelen: Wenn, dann richtig! Wenn die Makrelen (oft gleichzeitig mit den Seehechten) in den Hjeltefjord ziehen, ist in Nautnes die H√É¬∂lle los. Die Angelei auf die Mini-Tune ist leicht erkl√É¬§rt: Einfach irgendwie einen Haken ins Wasser halten und schon h√É¬§ngt eine Makrele dran. Einfacher geht√Ç¬¥s nicht. Seehecht: Wenn Seehechte vor Ort sind (meistens August √¢¬Ä¬ì Oktober) sind Massenf√É¬§nge eher die Regel als die Ausnahme. Fischfetzen im Mittelwasser oder einige Meter √É¬ºber Grund angeboten bringen dann den Fisch ins Boot! Dorsch: L√É¬∂cher, Rinnen, Plateaus √¢¬Ä¬ì Standorte f√É¬ºr Dorsche sind in der Regel auf der Seekarte leicht auszumachen. Gro√É¬üe Gummifische und mittlere Pilker sind oft die Erfolgsk√É¬∂der. Einmal am richtigen√Ç¬†Platz angekommen, sind Fische um 5 Kilo (und mehr) keine Seltenheit. Mit Fischfetzen und ganzen Makrelen funktioniert√Ç¬¥s auch. Seelachs: Kleine K√É¬∂hler gibt es in Nautnes oft an fast jeder Ecke. Am Fjordausgang bei der Stange haben Sie schnell die (K√É¬∂derfisch-) Kiste voll. Gr√É¬∂√É¬üere Exemplare gehen hin- und wieder beim Pilken an die Haken, mit gen√É¬ºgend Geduld k√É¬∂nnen die gro√É¬üen aber auch gezielt gesucht und gefangen werden. Pollack: Der Sportfisch!

Liquid urethane is then poured into the mould, which is quickly shut and sealed. The urethane expands, hardens, and fuses with the coat of primer. The mould is then unlocked and opened, revealing a perfect duplicate of the original product, complete with a finished coat of primer. Ekena Millwork's urethane millwork line is made up of both standard industry designs as well as their own unique products. Each item begins with a finely crafted original master, which is then used to make several moulds. Ensuring only the highest quality products, each mould is consistently maintained and then immediately replaced if they show even the slightest signs of wear. This gives them the ability to guarantee that the detail of every product they create is as clean and crisp as the first.

The campus is beautiful and quaint, and I especially love how anywhere you go, someone will always be smiling and ready to say hello. Everyone at Westminster is very friendly, not only the students, but all of the staff, as well! It's never awkward seeing a professor on campus because they go out of their way to call you out (by name) and ask how you're doing. It's great! It definitely makes you feel at home and a part of the Westminster community. Am learning a lot Westminster College is a very challenging school. I feel like I am learning so much more than I would be in a larger school because I am able to interact with other students and professors both during and after classes. All of the professors have office hours where they dedicate time to help their students with homework and difficult course objectives. I have found this to be so helpful because, as a student, you feel like you are getting a one-on-one lesson with the expert!

For kdSnprintfKHR and kdVsnprintfKHR, bufsize is the size of the buffer, and the functions never write beyond that size. If buf does not point to writable memory long enough for the shorter of the requested output or the supplied bufsize (as applicable), or if format is not a readable null-terminated string, then undefined behavior results. Return value On success, the functions return the length of the written string without its null termination. For kdSnprintfKHR and kdVsnprintfKHR, if the output (with null termination) would not fit into bufsize bytes, then the function returns what the length would have been if the buffer had been large enough, and null terminates the output so it just fits",True,1,0,,,"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 22:52:48 GMT"

As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA Guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. Additionally, under current regulations, accommodations are available with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), and student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education, that effectively exempt them from this requirement. The regulations establish a mechanism for separately furnishing payments for contraceptive services on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the group health plans of eligible organizations that avail themselves of an accommodation, and enrollees and dependents of student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education that avail themselves of an accommodation. These rules propose and seek comments on potential changes to the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úeligible organization√¢¬Ä? in the Departments' regulations in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v.

These interim final regulations provide an alternative process that an eligible organization may use to provide notice of its religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage, while preserving participants' and beneficiaries' (and enrollees' and dependents') access to coverage for the full range of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptives, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing., 32385=This document contains final rules implementing the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which requires parity between mental health or substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits with respect to financial requirements and treatment limitations under group health plans and group and individual health insurance coverage. This document also contains a technical amendment relating to external review with respect to the multi-state plan program administered by the Office of Personnel Management., 42613=√Ç¬ß 1185 - Standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns, 59672=This document contains proposed rules that would amend the regulations regarding excepted benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), and the Public Health Service Act related to limited wraparound coverage. Excepted benefits are generally exempt from the requirements that were added to those laws by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act., 40924=√Ç¬ß 1059 - Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, 41598=√Ç¬ß 1166 - Notice requirements, 3415=This document contains final regulations that amend the regulations regarding excepted benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Public Health Service Act to specify requirements for limited wraparound coverage to qualify as an excepted benefit. Excepted benefits are generally exempt from the requirements that were added to those laws by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Affordable Care Act., 42131=√Ç¬ß 1181 note - Increased portability through limitation on preexisting condition exclusions, 54512=This document contains proposed regulations regarding the summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and the uniform glossary for group health plans and health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It proposes changes to the regulations that implement the disclosure requirements under section 2715 of the Public Health Service Act to help plans and individuals better understand their health coverage, as well as to gain a better understanding of other coverage options for comparison. It proposes changes to documents required for compliance with section 2715 of the Public Health Service Act, including a template for the SBC, instructions, sample language, a guide for coverage example calculations, and the uniform glossary., 41117=√Ç¬ß 1161 - Plans must provide continuation coverage to certain individuals, 88538=These proposed regulations contain amendments to notice requirements of the health care continuation coverage (COBRA) provisions of Part 6 of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to better align the provision of guidance under the COBRA notice requirements with the Affordable Care Act provisions already in effect, as well as any provisions of federal law that will become applicable in the future., 41343=√Ç¬ß 1163 - Qualifying event, 45251=Title 29 published on 2013-07-01, 45341=The following are ALL rules, proposed rules, and notices (chronologically) published in the Federal Register relating to 29 CFR Part 2590 after this date., 103810=This document contains proposed rules that would amend the regulations regarding excepted benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Public Health Service Act. Excepted benefits are generally exempt from the health reform requirements that were added to those laws by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act., 76690=This document proposes a change to the definition of an eligible organization that can avail itself of an accommodation with respect to coverage of certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA Guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. Additionally, under current regulations, accommodations are available with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), and student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education, that effectively exempt them from this requirement. The regulations establish a mechanism for separately furnishing payments for contraceptive services on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the group health plans of eligible organizations that avail themselves of an accommodation, and enrollees and dependents of student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education that avail themselves of an accommodation. These rules propose and seek comments on potential changes to the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úeligible organization√¢¬Ä? in the Departments' regulations in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), to ensure that participants and beneficiaries in group health plans (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by institutions of higher education) obtain, without additional cost, coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive services, as prescribed by a health care provider, while respecting certain closely held for-profit entities' religion-based objections to contraceptive coverage. These proposed rules also seek comments on any additional steps the government should take to help ensure coverage of the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing, for participants and beneficiaries in group health plans of such entities (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by such entities that are institutions of higher education)., 44140=110 Stat. 1936, 41251=√Ç¬ß 1162 - Continuation coverage, 43109=√Ç¬ß 1191 - Preemption; State flexibility; construction, 42283=√Ç¬ß 1182 - Prohibiting discrimination against individual participants and beneficiaries based on health status, 41688=√Ç¬ß 1167 - Definitions and special rules, 41870=√Ç¬ß 1169 - Additional standards for group health plans, 8433=This document contains final regulations that amend the regulations regarding excepted benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), and the Public Health Service Act. Excepted benefits are generally exempt from the health reform requirements that were added to those laws by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In addition, eligibility for excepted benefits does not preclude an individual from eligibility for a premium tax credit under section 36B of the Code if an individual chooses to enroll in coverage under a Qualified Health Plan through an Affordable Insurance Exchange. These regulations finalize some but not all of the proposed rules with minor modifications; additional guidance on limited wraparound coverage is forthcoming.}",{980=Title 29 published on 2013-07-01.},"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 16:44:46 GMT"

If a website was not able to be reached, a second checkpoint from a different location performed another availability check. If the website was still not available, an error was recorded. During the research period, only the availability of the front page was examined. Scheduled maintenance periods were not factored into these test results. For the period when a website was available, it was registered as uptime. During the period when errors were generated, it was registered as downtime.
