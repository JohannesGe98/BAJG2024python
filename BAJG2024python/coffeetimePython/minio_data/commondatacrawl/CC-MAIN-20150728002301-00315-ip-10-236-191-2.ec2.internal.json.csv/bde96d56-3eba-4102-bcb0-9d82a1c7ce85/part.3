Parking permits are $220 a semester, and trying to find a parking spot anywhere between 8:30-12:45 is a nightmare, good luck!

The state budget crisis for the 2009-2010 school year has however made the cost rise. Although it has been hectic registering for classes as well as paying for classes this year, I still feel like the education at this school is worth the money. Some people go to community colleges before a university, but I personally think that holds students back and it usually takes them 5 years to graduate. Going to CSUF straight out of high school is definitely worth the money., 465367=California State University, Fullerton is a very cozy campus with everything the college student needs.

Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution. Having priority registration is a big deal because it's very difficult to get the classes you need with the budget cuts (they cut lots of classes).

If eligible, you can sign up to receive free birth control, pap smears, etc. Medications are also offered at a very low cost to students, saving them a lot of money normally spent on medical necessities. In addition, Cal State offers free group and individual counseling. Maintaining a healthy mental state is key to a good life so having that come at no charge is a blessing. 3. ASI. ASI is a student leadership group on campus that promotes low to no cost sporting events, concerts, and other fun opportunities to students. Go by their tables when you see them and get some awesome freebies, too.', ""If you've heard of Fullerton, then you've definitely heard of DTF. What is DTF you ask? Downtown Fullerton. It is about 3-4 blocks, with the center being Harbor Blvd and Commonwealth Ave, of bars, restaurants, and other little shops. Thursday-Saturday is when DTF is poppin'. College students from all around the county come to take a shot or have a brewskie with their pals. Fullerton is pretty much at the heart of the O.C. so there are PLENTY of fun things to do when you're not in school. The beach, Disneyland, Mammoth Mountain, Knott's Berry Farm, L.A. sight-seeing, the Angels Stadium, Honda Center. So many fun places to go and enjoy your time with friends!"", ""Don't ever fear of not finding somewhere to eat on campus! There is a main eatery in the Student Union that includes a variety of storefronts ranging from Rubio's to an eco-friendly, vegetarian cafe. Cal State also has its own Carl's Jr. and Starbucks. If you're not feeling anything on campus, there is a cornucopia of delicious restaurants surrounding the area including Pieology and Yogurtland."", ""I do not live on dorms on campus. For the most part, Cal State is a commuter school. Although I am not acquainted with dorm life, I have heard several conversations about Fullerton's many sororities and fraternities. Many of these clubs have group houses that are said to build great camaraderie amongst its members."", 'Titans are definitely challenged when they are looking to obtain a degree. I took 4 courses last semester and found myself dedicating hours to studying, much more so than I did at Fullerton Junior College. Also, the teachers use advanced vocabulary and abstract thinking skills that require close attention to be paid in class.', 'If you are looking to study at Cal State Fullerton, I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the SRC, or Student Recreation Center. It is a beautiful new facility that makes working out fun. I also recommend making the most of group projects for your classes. Get to know others in your classes--you will most likely see them around campus. Do work in the study rooms, eat together at the cafeteria, and then chill in the library!', ""I am proud to call myself a Titan because Cal Sate Fullerton is a school to brag about. I have lived near this school for my entire life and I thought I'd seen everything that this area had to offer. However, when I stepped foot into campus I felt like I lost myself in a whole new world.""]]",California State University-Fullerton (CSUF) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/California-State-University-Fullerton/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/105280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,208,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00315-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,885460519,885261135,HORIZONTAL,,"07/31/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 24 out of 25 people found this review useful. 1 of 245 Gabrielle from Placentia, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Living on-campus gives you much more time to become involved, connect with new friends, study, and become independent.

You will have much more fun in college if you belong to clubs and programs."", 'Cal State Fullerton is a great university for students who like small class sizes and one-on-one time with the professors.

Within the last year, tuition has increased almost $1,000. Not only has tuition increased, but teachers are being told to take furlough 6 days a semester that will cut their salaries by 10%. Students are paying 30% more, but is receiving 10% less for their education because teachers don't have classes on their furlough days. Even with the tuition hikes, Cal State University, Fullerton is more affordable than other 4-year universities. Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home. There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city.

I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.

The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.

However, a lot of teachers don't push their students to learn more and try harder. Especially in GE classes, more than half of the students in a particular class only want to pass the class with a C. This is the case in most colleges, but I hadn't expected it when I enrolled at this university. I would enjoy a more challenging environment. Am learning a lot During my first year of college, I found that there is so much a student can learn - whether it be in-depth knowledge in a particular subject or about the college system itself - moreover, each student is responsible for taking the initiative to learn. At California State University - Fullerton, most of the teachers I've come across only give their students the information they need to pass a class. It is up to the student to take time and ask a question or go to office hours so that he can learn and more fully understand the subject.

Also, freshman programs tell you to only take 4 classes (12 units) because they tell you it's going to be too difficult, which is a total lie, taking 4 classes was too easy.

There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life.

The school is expensive, yes, not one is doubting that. However, if you speak to almost any student or alumni they will inform you about how enriching the experience is.

If the choice is between a cheap school where you are miserable or Florida Tech then I hope the choice is obvious. Now then it also depends on your major. My career choice makes eighty grand as a starting salary and I have quite a few scholarships not to mention the high demand for chemical engineers, so as long as I stick with it I will be able to pay off any money I owe fairly quickly.

I have taken part in the zombie vs. human war both semesters and had the fun of both shooting my fellow sci fi loving peers with nerf guns and tagging them to turn them into a zombie as well. This game is one of my favorites because it invlolves everyone getting outside, meeting new people, and using their brains to create strategies. The professors are very caring and hard working. My chemical engineering professor gives us as much time as we need and will work late any day to help out his students. The professor I volunteer for is a genius and he pushes us to reach our full potential and make the right choices. My sorority sisters are like a family.

It is very difficult to get into the basic level classes with the professors that everyone likes, because those professors are not only the most interesting ones, but also the ones that you will learn the most from. Also, every time that you register for a new set of classes, you have to meet with your assigned academic adviser.

You'll walk in the dining hall thinking, Ugh. I wonder what horrid form of sustenance they shall serve me today, and you'll see something you love and start rushing to get a plate before it's gone.

I would know. I've had a really rough go-round with teaching myself how to study and not having the courage to ask questions, but it can be done.

Don't fly solo, but don't be a party animal. - Friends are really a wonderful asset to college life, and they're what give you the memories that you'll tell your family about one day. However, you do not want to become one of those people who goes out every weekend, partying and drinking and waking up with someone who's name you don't even remember; those people typically fail out. Don't party, but have friends because depression can really be a problem without them sometimes. Keep in touch with your family/friends at home - They love you, and they miss you. You mean more to them than you probably know, and you should talk to them whenever you get the chance. Skype and my phone have kept me up with my family back home (I'm including my dearest friends at home in that, by the way), and talking to them is a great escape from homework sometimes. ;) Work THEN play. - YAY! FRIDAY! No. Don't do that. I mean, you can say that, but don't think you can just sit there and chill. You probably have homework or something that you should do first, and, trust me, you don't want to procrastinate. (But we all do it anyway.) Find an organization. - A group of people working toward a common goal! This will take some of your free time, but you'll make new friends and have some fun with them. It's also a great way to be well-rounded. GET UP! - Don't just be a bump on a log! Go outside. Run. Join fencing. Play soccer/futbol or baseball OR ULTIMATE FRISBEE. I hear there even might be a Quidditch team soon. Or start something yourself if you can't find it! Just be active. It's really good for you. (Oh, great...I sound so cliche...) Be yourself. - Yeah, you can start anew, but why would you want to be loved for what you're not? Love who you are; eat how you want to; dress the way you like; be yourself.

Security is more of an annoyance that gives out ridiculous amounts of parking tickets and often seen eating at the dining hall. Some of them are very nice, others not so much.', 'If you are major into the party scene, this school is not for you. We have some parties, but nothing crazy that you see in movies or at state schools. If you come from Florida and never want to see the people you went to high school with ever again, this is the school for you. Most people in Florida have never even heard of this place and its a great way to escape from the whole high school scene and start fresh.', ""There are a ton of international students here. About 40% of the student population hails from another country. In some ways, you can learn more from your fellow students than your classes because there are some things that can't be taught in a classroom. Most of my own friends are international."", 'This school is expensive but they give a ton of financial aid. Furthermore, you will most likely get a job right away from a great company, which means you can start paying back any loans you might have immediately.', ""If you are a beach bum, this is the place for you. Even if you don't own a car, it is only a short 3 mile bike ride away. If you are a surfer, cocoa beach and Melbourne have some of the best waves on the east coast. Orlando is only 45 minutes away. Many students have annual passes to Universal or Disney and go frequently. All the clubs and bars are there too, if your into that kinda thing. There is a surprisingly large amount of rednecks in the area too, hailing from the Palm Bay area that love to take their trucks, ATVs and dirt bikes out to go offroad on the weekends."", 'The main dining hall is brand new. You love the food in the beginning, but as the years go on you really want something more than what they offer. Most of the meals are home style with mashed potatoes and stuff but occasionally they have something exciting like sushi or international chefs come in to spice up the dining. The grocery store has a bunch of stuff, mostly gluten free and the other places on campus have pretty decent food too.', 'The dorms range from the traditional style, with shared rooms and community bathrooms to suite-style apartments with private bedrooms. Almost all the housing is relatively new (the most recent finished last year) and clean with decent amenities. The private rooms are a little small, but that is the price paid for living on campus.The Resident Assistants only come around twice a year to do room inspections and play a very minimalist role in your life. Unfortunately the only kind of pet you are legally allowed to have is a fish, but plenty of people have had a variety of pets over the years without any issues. It is required by the institution that all students must live on campus for a minimum of two years.', 'The classes are HARD. They are designed to push you. Luckily, in the small Florida Tech community, everyone knows everyone and that includes the professors. Most will get to know students by name and are very friendly and eager to help students. Your education at Florida Tech will be very personalized. your academic advisor will make sure to set you up with the right courses and amount of classes each semester. Just make sure that you are up for a challenge.', 'Take your AP classes! If you can get as many classes as possible out of the way, life will be easier for you. Many people, especially engineering majors, graduate as super seniors (5 years instead of the regular 4). If you want to save time and money, stock up on knowledge in high school and get your AP classes crossed off the list before you even get to college.', ""Florida Tech is a great school for people interested in engineering and the rest of the sciences. It's known as one of the most best-kept secrets in the Florida education system.

It's right in front of you, in the people you love and in yourself., 37931=They have rolling admission, but if you get everything in by early January then you get priority consideration for scholarships (check fit.edu/e-mail the admissions department or your admissions counselor for the dates for the year you're applying). You'll also know the decision in some cases in just a few weeks! Same goes for the FAFSA, file early and you'll get priority and also in the past there have been early filer grants where if you file your FAFSA before a certain date you'll get another 1,000 for that year (not this year so they may not be doing it again). ***If you visit and attend a campus tour, half-day, or full-day event, on campus then you get another $1,000 per year automatically if you attend! It's worth the visit - you can get into Florida early and go to Disney, see a game, explore Melbourne or the state, go to the beach, and get some more money for tuition!, 135129=Florida Tech is a campus that is busing with international flavor. I started as a freshman in 2010 studying aviation management / flight. Florida tech offers a very wide varieties of degrees to chose from. Sports and recreational activities are all over the campus. Although small there is always something to do on campus or within the town of Melbourne. Florida Tech is a bit on the pricey side of colleges on the coast but i am confident in what i'm paying for., 150143=Become friends with the RAs, the residence hall dorms are a lot larger than you think (except for Roberts Hall). Study math and grammar over the summer so you don't have to take the introductory classes. Join a sports team., 386278=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The extremely low figures for the C30, S40 and V50 have been achieved thanks to an advanced Start/Stop system. The latest version of the C30 DRIVe uses only 3.8 liters of diesel per 100 km which equals just 99 grams of CO2/km. The 104 gram Volvo S40 1.6D DRIVe was named Green Car of the Year at the prestigious 2009 What Car? Green Car Awards. All of today's DRIVe models are equipped with a conventional diesel engine and manual gearbox optimized for extra-low fuel consumption, and are tailored specifically for low rolling resistance and reduced air drag. The V70 and S80 models both reach 129 grams of CO2 per kilometer using the same 1.6-litre diesel engine. Also, the XC60 and XC70 are offered in frontwheel drive DRIVe versions powered by the 2.4D engine, with emissions of only 159 g/km and fuel consumption a best-in-class 6.0 l/100 km for both cars., 1060=Volvo Cars' Torslanda site increased its efficiency by integrating engine assembly in the vehicle final assembly plant. In Ghent, the last unit of the previous generation Volvo S60 rolled off the assembly line, a Sapphire Black car destined for a customer in Taiwan. In total, the Ghent plant built 578,292 S60 cars during the years 2000-2009Ã‚Â making it one of the longest running Volvo models in the plant. The Ghent plant is now preparing for the new S60 model which will enter production in 2010. At the Uddevalla plant, number 50,000 of the second generation Volvo C70 was handed over to its German owner. Production of the all-new S80L model was introduced in the Chongqing plant which already produced the Volvo S40., 6755=In the quest for the ultimate vision of an accident free traffic environment, Volvo Car Corporation's short-term target is that no one will be killed or injured in a new Volvo car by year 2020. In recent years, focus has shifted from protection to prevention and continuous progress is being made. New technologies in Volvo cars such as Collision Warning with Auto Brake and City Safety can warn and assist the driver in difficult situations, in order to mitigate or avoid an accident., 118=Cars production by model and plant 2009, no. of cars, 2596=Volvo - The Game, a joint venture between game development company SimBin and Volvo Cars was launched in May and by December, it had already been played on more than 850,000 computers the world over. More than 300,000 people have watched YouTube films about the game and about 20,000 new players take up the challenge every week. Using this communication channel, Volvo has renewed the brand name and reached out with the new S60 model far beyond regular customer groups., 14373=Despite difficult times for the car industry, 2009 was a very productive year for Volvo Car Corporation with a number of introductions and exciting news - environment and safety technologies as well as concept cars and new production models. A strengthened product program with a range of fuel efficient DRIVe products and the Volvo XC60 were well received in an otherwise challenging market situation. A number of successful sponsorship and communication projects were carried out - Volvo Ocean Race, Volvo team Polestar in the Swedish Touring Car Championship and Volvo The Game to mention a few., 3661=The overall winner of the 2008-09 Volvo Ocean Race was Ericsson 4 who ensured the victory already before the final leg to the finish in St Petersburg, Russia. The race started in Alicante and followed a 37,000 nautical mile journey around the planet. For the first time, the race visited Asia, with stopovers in Cochin, India, Singapore, and Qingdao, China. The 11th Volvo Ocean Race will start from its new home base of Alicante in Spain in the autumn of 2011., 7574=Work is under way on evaluating an entirely electric-powered car known as a BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle). The Volvo C30 BEV prototype features the very same safety, comfort and space as the standard car; however it is powered solely by electricity, and has a range of up to 150 kilometers. A small number of prototypes of the C30 BEV have been built and tested internally by Volvo. In December 2009, Volvo Cars was granted research funds by the Swedish Energy Agency for the continued development of next generation electric cars. A test fleet of 50 vehicles will be built to evaluate the technology and gather information about driving behavior., 12611=The first official pictures of the all-new Volvo S60 were released, showing a sportier and more dynamic car than any previous Volvo model. The new Volvo S60 is the first car to be offered with Pedestrian Detection. The car will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in early March 2010. Production will start in early summer 2010 at the Volvo Cars plant in Ghent, Belgium. The new S60 was previewed as the S60 concept car at the Detroit Autoshow in January 2009 and was awarded ""Most beautiful concept car"" by German Auto Bild magazine., 4209=In 2009, Volvo's three-point safety belt turned 50, celebrating the world's first car with standard-fit three-point safety belts - a Volvo PV544 - built in 1959. Over the next 50 years, the V-shaped three-point safety belt saved well over one million lives. To this day, the three-point safety belt remains the car's single most important safety feature., 6210=Volvo Cars' groundbreaking new technology - Collision Warning with Full Auto Brake and Pedestrian Detection - will be introduced together with the all-new Volvo S60 in 2010. This system can detect a pedestrian in front of the car and brake automatically to avoid an accident. The aim is to help the driver avoid collisions with pedestrians at speeds below 25 km/h. If the car is travelling faster, the aim is to reduce the impact speed as much as possible - the risk of a pedestrian being killed in an accident at 50 kilometres per hour is 85 percent higher compared to if the speed is 25 kilometres per hour., 8402=A joint venture project between Volvo Cars and energy supplier Vattenfall will develop plug-in hybrid cars and an energy infrastructure. The project will research the wishes and demands from drivers, determine driving habits and establish how they want to charge their cars. Volvo is introducing a series-produced plug-in hybrid as early as 2012, combining pure electric power from the battery with an efficient diesel engine. The combined range is about 1,200 kilometers and carbon dioxide emissions will average out at 49 grams per kilometer, with fuel consumption of 1.9 liters per 100 km. In the summer of 2009, three Volvo V70 demonstration cars were presented, to be used to gather information for the development projects.}"
