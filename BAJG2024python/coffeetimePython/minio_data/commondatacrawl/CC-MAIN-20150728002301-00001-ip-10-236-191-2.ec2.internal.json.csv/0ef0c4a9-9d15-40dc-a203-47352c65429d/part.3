I've been in both and can honestly say I prefer Kramer, but only because I'm more familiar with it. Another nice thing is that you can use your meal swipe at either of the dining halls, so if you want to eat dinner with your friends across campus, it's entirely possible. The food selection is great, and there is always two or three options if something doesn't tickle your fancy. The third dining hall is very small and I've never been in it because it exclusively serves the Strong complex of residence halls. I hear you have to be invited to eat there."", ""There are both pros and cons to living in the dorms. As a freshman, the dorms are a great place to meet new people that aren't in your field of study. All you've got to do is leave your door open and wait for someone to say hello. It's also a great place to get homework help from the students that are in the same classes you are, and your RA is always willing to help with problems. On the other hand, the dorms can be a rowdy place to try and get some studying done, and there is always another distraction. More potential problems arise with a roommate. A lot of people I know are good friends with their roommate and get along great, but I didn't like sharing that small space with a different personality."", ""I suspect that this category differs for the various colleges included in the university, but in the engineering department, there are many challenging courses.

I've tried calling SafeWalk several times in the past when leaving the library (which is by the engineering side of campus where most of the assaults take place) and received no answer. Which was one of the main reasons my mom wanted me to pick this campus. Also, a lot of the emergency boxes are run down and don't actually work. K-State talks up their SafeWalk and campus safety programs, but overall it's not as impressive as you think it is until you're a student and have lived it. So unfortunately, unless you have a buddy, try to avoid campus at night since we have a serial rapist. If you're a woman that is."", ""I'm not a big social, club person. But the clubs I have joined in seemed to be a very tight knit family. I really enjoy the group FIRE and was also a member of Pre-Vet Club and attempted Collegiate Cattlewomen. Just wasn't my type of a thing. But is great for someone who is into that kind of stuff."", ""Of course every college is going to have high tuition. But I feel like the majority of my tuition is wasted. I was previously an Animal Science/Pre-Vet major with a double major in Women's Studies and recently changed to nursing. The Women's Studies department is amazing and all of the professors actually care about making sure you learn the content and are very passionate about what they do. However, in Animal Science, I felt like the majority of the classes, since they were larger, didn't really care and just wanted to throw the content at you to say they did their job. I also had a horrible advisor who was a complete scatter brain and didn't know anything about the classes outside of Animal Science. Was very sad. He also was the one who made me change my mind about my major in Animal Science. He pretty much told me I wasn't smart enough and needed to downgrade to something else. Which was very sad for me because I loved the idea of being a veterinarian. But after working at the vet hospital (which was quite an experience) and being told that I was going to fail I eventually gave up on that dream. K-State doesn't have it's priorities straight when it comes to what they spend student tuition on. And the fact that, as I previously stated, my tuition also goes towards paying for my tutoring I am very disappointed with the fact that I'm paying someone who has no idea what they're doing to help me. Very sad."", ""Food was usually pretty great at Derby. I did get food poisoning once from undercooked chicken, but that was the only time I really felt like the food was terrible. There are lots of options and a great variety for students to choose from. Breakfast was my favorite meal of the day! And I'm not typically a breakfast person. Willie Wok was definitely the best to eat at though. :)"", 'My dorm was awful. All of the other dorms were great, but my floor partied 24/7 even though I was on the 24 hours quiet floor. I would even talk to my RA about it and she blew me off and told me she would take care of it but never did because the girls that tended to party all the time were good friends of hers. But other dorms I visited where my friends stayed seemed to be decent enough. Moore hall is awful but Haymaker is by far the best.', ""My smaller classes have always benefitted me more than my larger ones. Classes like biology and chemistry were terrible for me. I struggled with the content and when asked for help wasn't given the help I need or was blown off and told to go talk to a tutor. However, physics has been a much better experience for me which is NOT what I expected at all. However, the tutors in Leasure Hall tend to be worthless. I've had 3 tutors there (currently one for physics and in the past for macroeconomics and chemistry). All three have turned out to be awful and not much help to me at all. In macro, the girl just wanted to flirt with the boys the whole time. In chemistry he treated you like a moron if you didn't know how to derive the answer. And in physics, she doesn't know how to do half of the problems and gets them wrong for us when she tries and claims it's been a while. Which I get, but at least try to keep up with the class a bit if you're going to be a tutor."", ""Kansas State University definitely has its fair share of pros and cons. There are a lot of good people here and professors who mean well. However, it wasn't quite the atmosphere that I thought it would be and am slightly disappointed. But if you're looking for a school that you want to feel connected with in your department, you better pick one of the smaller, less popular majors.""]]",Kansas State University (K-State) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kansas-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1465,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,72,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00001-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889792123,889641495,HORIZONTAL,,"{443646=April fool.

The UPC or Union Program Council puts on a lot of acts throughout the year, examples of who came to the college last year are a hypnotist, comedians, a magician, and an improvisational troupe. As well as putting on shows, they also show movies every weekend for movie lovers everywhere to enjoy. There are opportunities to get involved with the UPC and plan things as well, if that is something that you enjoy, I would recommend looking into joining it and helping think of ideas for your fellow students to enjoy. As well as those events, there are also these events where you can go listen to foreign exchange students talk about their countries and get a little taste of where they came from through food. You could also get involved with your dorms Hall Governing Board, and volunteer with them to get and serve your dorm. There are plenty of things to do in Manhattan if you just look around and read the upcoming events!', 'The dining halls on campus are full of options and good food. Although some people can get sick of it after a while, everyone loves it right when the dining halls open. There are always many different options so if you do not like one of them, you can just go to the change-ups line and get the meal that is being served there that night. I live in the Kramer complex, so it is smaller than Derby, which means that usually there are less lines and it is easier to get your bowl of salad, rather than reaching around a hundred people. Derby is great too, whenever I have eaten there, there are just as many if not a few more options to eat for dinner or lunch. I really enjoy the food at the dining centers, and although I do miss home cooking sometimes, it makes it easier to get by without it.', 'Dorm life is a wild ride, and is something that should be experienced by all incoming freshman. The dorms at K-State are up to par, and I have not heard very many complaints about the living situations or buildings that the students reside in. Although living in a community style hall can be very scary at first, most dorm livers get used to it and it becomes something that one does not give a second thought to. I think that it is a good idea to live in one of those community style living arrangements rather than living in a suite, because you do get that extra interaction with the people living right next door to you. In the dorms there is always someone willing to help you with homework that you do not understand, or a bed that you cannot loft yourself. That is one of my favorite things about the dorms, there is always someone there to help you or to talk to you. The dorm experience is one that I will never forget.', 'At K-State, students are usually expected to be in class ready to learn about whatever subject they are enrolled in. While some teachers do take attendance, there are a lot that do not. Despite this, the professors do encourage students to be there and some use iClickers or attendance sheets to award extra points to the students that did show up to class. As well as those extra points, homework is very important in these classes as well. Some classes assign homework but do not require it to be turned back in. Many students take this as a blessing and do not even begin to look at the homework, let alone complete it. This is a big mistake, because the extra practice can lead to way better test scores and a happier you! The homework can be hard, but with enough of those extra assignments and help from the professors, many students start to get a hold of the concepts and learn.', 'I would recommend that prospective students start looking into your colleges early. At Kansas State there are events that they put on called Family Day and Junior and Senior days. I found those very helpful as I was deciding on which college to choose, they helped me realize that I was meant to be at KSU. They also showed me how nice the people around campus were, and how willing they are to help incoming students with directions or any questions they might have.', 'Kansas State University has many of opportunities for students that are currently in college, and students that are planning on attending there in the next few years. There are plenty of fun activities to do on campus, from going to a football game to seeing shows at the Union, you can always be on the go. Another thing I love about my school is the education that you receive, it is always up to par and the professors are usually understanding and very helpful.']]",Kansas State University (K-State) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kansas-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1465,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,96,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00001-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889792123,889641495,HORIZONTAL,,"{443646=April fool.

Make sure to pay the dorm down-payment, which is either $400 or $500 and is due around the same time that you fill out the housing contract, as early as you can. Waiting until May (when you're planning on moving into dorms in August) can result in you being placed in temporary housing, which means you are stuck wherever housing is available and then you'll receive an email anywhere from three days to four months after moving telling you that you have two days to pack and move everything to another room. Freshman year is generally the best time to take the off-the-wall classes, because once you get into your major specific classes, depending on your field of study, you could run into a bit of a time crunch.

More information can be found online or at the entrances to the dining halls.

I cannot stress this enough. Many of the professors won't overload you with paper after project after paper, but will give you many reading assignments. If you don't do the reading assignments because you're used to being able to slide by them in high school, that would be your biggest mistake. Much of the material that is covered in the reading assignments/books is seen on your mid terms and finals as well as in classroom tests and discussions, and discussions are often times a big part of your grade. - Get involved! Salem State offers so many opportunities for scholarships and being involved in big projects for those students who step up and get involved in any of our student leadership programs/honor societies/Gay-Straight-Alliance/etc. - Make sure you have an alarm, and make sure you wake up to it. I can not stress how big of a grade attendance is at least 60% of the time in classes. I know in all of my classes attendance was at least 25% of my grade, so if you're one of the people who ignores your alarm clock most of the time, I'd invest in two or three alarm clocks and make sure they're all set up extremely high so you don't sleep through your classes all of the time. You'll regret it in the long run if you do. - Get your application in as soon as possible. While Salem State is based on a rolling admission, some of the majors are difficult and challenging to get into (like nursing, for example) and if you apply too late, you'll be rejected or wait listed simply because you waited too long. - Get your financial aid application in on time or better yet, early! Salem State College as I mentioned before offers SUCH good financial aid if you get your application for it in on time before the dead line, and unless you're independently wealthy through your parents, that makes such a big difference in whether you're struggling to get through the semesters or not. - Visit the campus. Make sure that it's what you want. Don't just look at the pictures on the website and be like oh, okay. There is a lot of construction going on, on North Campus that will wake you up at obnoxious hours in the morning if you don't have an early class if it's still going on next year which I'm sure it will be. Make sure you understand that the campuses are a good 10 (Central) to 20 (South) walk apart from each other and sometimes you will have to tough out the rain/wind/etc. to walk there if you miss the shuttle/the shuttle decides to take forever to show up and you don't want to be late."", ""One of the biggest things that drew me to Salem State was it's price and very richly awarding financial aid.

Salem is known for it's historic content, and you'll see that as soon as you wander outside of campus (which is very easy to do). The school provides shuttle services on the weekends for those of you planning to live on campus which will bring you to either the North Shore Mall or the Liberty Tree Mall, Vinnen Square (which is in Swampscott but still has plenty of places to shop), Downtown, and the Train Station (if you want to head out to Boston or a more populated city for the weekend). These shuttles run until 1am on the weekends so you'll always have something to do. As for during the week days, down town is only a 20 or so minute walk away from campus. You can catch movies down town, and there are several places to eat including a pizza place and a few Chinese food places; these are all places that will take your clipper card so you don't even have to fork up cash or your debit card. Your clipper card is your student ID where you have a set number of what are called flex dollars that you can use both on and off campus. There are also many places to visit including museums (which we get into a few of them for free, being students), stores that sell pretty interesting witchery-related merchandise, and in general a few very nice 'commons' areas where you can sit and relax if the weather's nice and just talk with your friends. If you don't want to leave campus, there are always a lot of events going on at night on campus whether it's art shows/movie productions/dance recitals/speeches."", ""Salem State has to be one of the best state schools. Every single one of my professors were willing and able to help me if I didn't understand a particular subject, or if I needed help on exactly what we were assigned to be doing. The courses are taught at a steady pace and the professors are willing to answer any and all questions about the material they are covering. Anything that you might think is too difficult can actually be made very understandable because most if not all of the staff from my own experience will be able to help you. They propose very thought-provoking questions (at least in my experience with certain professors in the Sociology/Philosophy/Psychology departments) that give you a deeper insight on the material being covered so you walk out of class with more thoughts that you had when you went into class, for sure. A few of the history professors aren't too top notch and while they know what they are talking about, in my experience they haven't been able to capture the attention of the class and project what they are saying throughout the entire class very well. The class sizes are also considerably small compared to larger schools like U Mass, which helps a lot when the professor knows you by name since there's only 20 or so people in your class as compared to over 100. Salem State College also offers many computer labs where you can go to print your papers for free if you don't have money for printing at the library. The school also offers a Writing Center if you want to get your paper edited and revised before you turn it in so if it's a big part of your grade and you're not confident about it, the people who work at the Writing Center are a HUGE help.""]]",Salem State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Salem-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/7990,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00001-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,889843323,889792344,HORIZONTAL,,"{167119=Salem has tons of sports teams and clubs to join which everyone should take advantage of.

I cannot stress this enough. Many of the professors won't overload you with paper after project after paper, but will give you many reading assignments. If you don't do the reading assignments because you're used to being able to slide by them in high school, that would be your biggest mistake. Much of the material that is covered in the reading assignments/books is seen on your mid terms and finals as well as in classroom tests and discussions, and discussions are often times a big part of your grade. - Get involved! Salem State offers so many opportunities for scholarships and being involved in big projects for those students who step up and get involved in any of our student leadership programs/honor societies/Gay-Straight-Alliance/etc. - Make sure you have an alarm, and make sure you wake up to it. I can not stress how big of a grade attendance is at least 60% of the time in classes. I know in all of my classes attendance was at least 25% of my grade, so if you're one of the people who ignores your alarm clock most of the time, I'd invest in two or three alarm clocks and make sure they're all set up extremely high so you don't sleep through your classes all of the time.

Anything that you might think is too difficult can actually be made very understandable because most if not all of the staff from my own experience will be able to help you. They propose very thought-provoking questions (at least in my experience with certain professors in the Sociology/Philosophy/Psychology departments) that give you a deeper insight on the material being covered so you walk out of class with more thoughts that you had when you went into class, for sure. A few of the history professors aren't too top notch and while they know what they are talking about, in my experience they haven't been able to capture the attention of the class and project what they are saying throughout the entire class very well.

I cannot stress this enough. Many of the professors won't overload you with paper after project after paper, but will give you many reading assignments. If you don't do the reading assignments because you're used to being able to slide by them in high school, that would be your biggest mistake. Much of the material that is covered in the reading assignments/books is seen on your mid terms and finals as well as in classroom tests and discussions, and discussions are often times a big part of your grade. - Get involved! Salem State offers so many opportunities for scholarships and being involved in big projects for those students who step up and get involved in any of our student leadership programs/honor societies/Gay-Straight-Alliance/etc. - Make sure you have an alarm, and make sure you wake up to it. I can not stress how big of a grade attendance is at least 60% of the time in classes. I know in all of my classes attendance was at least 25% of my grade, so if you're one of the people who ignores your alarm clock most of the time, I'd invest in two or three alarm clocks and make sure they're all set up extremely high so you don't sleep through your classes all of the time. You'll regret it in the long run if you do. - Get your application in as soon as possible. While Salem",True,0,0,

When I was applying for school, I heard the same things from everyone - make new friends, branch out, try new things, and most importantly... get involved! I have done just that; I tried out for Salem State's intramural Hockey Cheerleading team (I made it!) and have met some amazing girls.

This past semester in my Child Growth class, my professor gave us everyday examples of how we will use what we have learned. We talked about everything in life, starting from the early stages of pregnancy to adolescence. We talked about the APGAR test once you have a child, and the psychology of children with Autism. We talked about birth order and how it effects the personality and cognitive/physical development of children, as well as the pros and cons of being or having an over-scheduled child. In my Math for Elementary Teachers class, I learned the basics of mathematics, as well as made some great friends. In this class, the teacher taught us how to teach our students the easiest and most effective techniques for learning addition, subtraction, fractions, decimals, percentages, and everything in between.

Anything that you might think is too difficult can actually be made very understandable because most if not all of the staff from my own experience will be able to help you. They propose very thought-provoking questions (at least in my experience with certain professors in the Sociology/Philosophy/Psychology departments) that give you a deeper insight on the material being covered so you walk out of class with more thoughts that you had when you went into class, for sure.

Although I miss being home and being away from my family, the people I meet here help me forget about it. There is always something to do on the weekends, even though it is a commuter school. The college sets up different shows, and hires different comedians, magicians and entertainers to help make your time spent at Salem State college memorable, as well as enjoyable. When I was applying for school, I heard the same things from everyone - make new friends, branch out, try new things, and most importantly... get involved! I have done just that; I tried out for Salem State's intramural Hockey Cheerleading team (I made it!) and have met some amazing girls. Getting involved and going to different activities that the school has set up is a great way to enjoy your time in college. Am learning a lot All of my classes at Salem State teach me the basics of the subject, as well as things I will use in my every day life. This past semester in my Child Growth class, my professor gave us everyday examples of how we will use what we have learned. We talked about everything in life, starting from the early stages of pregnancy to adolescence.",True,0,0,

The school is fairly cheap for a state school and isn't going to run you into the ground with hundreds of thousands dollars in debt when you graduate. The financial aid packages are very large as long as you apply for them on time, and I personally only have had to pay a maximum of 600 a semester from my own pocket. Considering that the staff is very helpful and the atmosphere of the campus is so nice and friendly, I find that this school is really a bang for the buck. They also have the 'Rent-A-Text' program with their school books, so a majority of your books you can rent so you're not paying $1000 and up every semester for books alone. The only complaint I have is that, at least in Peabody Hall (a freshmen dormitory), some of the Resident Assistants are very unhelpful when you need help with a problem you're having and it's very difficult to get to the right people if you're having a situation with your room mate that needs to be handled by one of the authorities of the building. Also, there has been constant construction going on right outside of Peabody Hall so if you're in Peabody, you're usually woken up at seven in the morning by loud, headache-inducing jack hammering outside of your window. The only other problem is that the campuses are far away from each other. If you're a freshman, you will be on North Campus in either Peabody or Bowditch hall, and if you get classes on South Campus - that's a good 15 to 20 minute walk away which seems even longer in the freezing cold/rain. Salem State offers shuttle services to get between North, Central, and South campuses but they are not anywhere near 100% reliable and sometimes you'll be out waiting for a shuttle for over a half hour and end up late to your class because the shuttle took forever to show up., 31424=Downtown Salem is of course fun in October but is fun all year. There are great restaurants and fun shops. The North Shore Mall is close by, and Boston is just a twenty minute ride on the commuter rail away.

This past semester in my Child Growth class, my professor gave us everyday examples of how we will use what we have learned. We talked about everything in life, starting from the early stages of pregnancy to adolescence. We talked about the APGAR test once you have a child, and the psychology of children with Autism. We talked about birth order and how it effects the personality and cognitive/physical development of children, as well as the pros and cons of being or having an over-scheduled child. In my Math for Elementary Teachers class, I learned the basics of mathematics, as well as made some great friends. In this class, the teacher taught us how to teach our students the easiest and most effective techniques for learning addition, subtraction, fractions, decimals, percentages, and everything in between. Salem State makes sure that you are learning what you want and need to be.

However, if you're looking to party every night of the week, this school is NOT for you. All buildings are pretty strict about quiet hours and Resident Assistants will not hesitate to report you if you're caught with alcohol or drugs within the building. So if you're coming to this school in hopes of partying every night, you're better off going to U Mass. This school is PERFECT for students that actually want to learn and aren't big on the party crowd, as except for Halloween week/night there aren't many places to party in the sense that you're used to down town or anywhere in the city either unless you go over to a neighboring city. If you're a student who enjoys learning and meeting friends and being able to hang around in your dorm lounge until two AM playing Apples to Apples and watching Hey Arnold on the television, then this school is for you. Tips for prospective students - Study! I cannot stress this enough. Many of the professors won't overload you with paper after project after paper, but will give you many reading assignments.

I cannot stress this enough. Many of the professors won't overload you with paper after project after paper, but will give you many reading assignments. If you don't do the reading assignments because you're used to being able to slide by them in high school, that would be your biggest mistake. Much of the material that is covered in the reading assignments/books is seen on your mid terms and finals as well as in classroom tests and discussions, and discussions are often times a big part of your grade. - Get involved! Salem State offers so many opportunities for scholarships and being involved in big projects for those students who step up and get involved in any of our student leadership programs/honor societies/Gay-Straight-Alliance/etc. - Make sure you have an alarm, and make sure you wake up to it. I can not stress how big of a grade attendance is at least 60% of the time in classes. I know in all of my classes attendance was at least 25% of my grade, so if you're one of the people who ignores your alarm clock most of the time, I'd invest in two or three alarm clocks and make sure they're all set up extremely high so you don't sleep through your classes all of the time. You'll regret it in the long run if you do. - Get your application in as soon as possible. While Salem State",True,0,0,

Every single one of my professors were willing and able to help me if I didn't understand a particular subject, or if I needed help on exactly what we were assigned to be doing. The courses are taught at a steady pace and the professors are willing to answer any and all questions about the material they are covering. Anything that you might think is too difficult can actually be made very understandable because most if not all of the staff from my own experience will be able to help you. They propose very thought-provoking questions (at least in my experience with certain professors in the Sociology/Philosophy/Psychology departments) that give you a deeper insight on the material being covered so you walk out of class with more thoughts that you had when you went into class, for sure. A few of the history professors aren't too top notch and while they know what they are talking about, in my experience they haven't been able to capture the attention of the class and project what they are saying throughout the entire class very well. The class sizes are also considerably small compared to larger schools like U Mass, which helps a lot when the professor knows you by name since there's only 20 or so people in your class as compared to over",True,0,0,

However, if you're looking to party every night of the week, this school is NOT for you. All buildings are pretty strict about quiet hours and Resident Assistants will not hesitate to report you if you're caught with alcohol or drugs within the building. So if you're coming to this school in hopes of partying every night, you're better off going to U Mass. This school is PERFECT for students that actually want to learn and aren't big on the party crowd, as except for Halloween week/night there aren't many places to party in the sense that you're used to down town or anywhere in the city either unless you go over to a neighboring city.

The statisticians had one key piece of information, which was the serial numbers on a few captured tanks. Assuming that the tanks were logically numbered, in the order in which they were produced, was enough to enable the statisticians to make an estimate of the total number of tanks that had been produced up to any given moment, based on the highest serial number in the sample and the sample size. Suppose the tanks were numbered 1 to N, where N was the total number of tanks produced and that five tanks had been captured with serial numbers 20, 31, 43, 78 and 92, say. From a sample of S = 5 and a maximum serial number M = 92, it was deduced that a good estimator of the number of tanks would be (M-1)(S+1)/S. In the example",False,-1,0,

A single mipmap level of a 3D texture is likewise a layered image, where the number of layers is the depth of that particular mipmap level. Also, a mipmap level of a cubemap is a layered image. For cubemaps, you get exactly 6 layers, one for each face. And the order of the faces is the same as the order of the enumerators: A layered image, as previously defined, is an ordered sequence of images of a particular size. A number of different kinds of textures can be considered layered. Layered Images The parameters work mostly the same as with texture attachment.

However, you shouldn't bother with it, as the TextureLayer function can do everything it can and more. Legacy","For cubemap arrays, the value that gl_LayerÃ¢Â€Â‹ represents is the layer-face index.

Each texture, when taken as a layered image, has a specific number of layers. For array and 3D textures, this is the depth of the texture. For cubemaps, this is always exactly 6 layers: one per face. Cubemap arrays have 6 * the number of layers, which is the number of layer-faces. To bind a texture as a layered image, use the following command:  void glFramebufferTextureÃ¢Â€Â‹(GLenum targetÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLenum attachmentÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLuint textureÃ¢Â€Â‹, GLint levelÃ¢Â€Â‹); The parameters have the same meaning as above.

It happens after primitive assembly, as an additional optional step in that part of the pipeline. A GS can create new primitives, unlike vertex shaders, which are limited to a 1:1 input to output ratio. A GS can also do layered rendering; this means that the GS can specifically say that a primitive is to be rendered to a particular layer of the framebuffer., 12202=Geometry shaders sit between Vertex Shaders (or the optional Tessellation stage) and the fixed-function Vertex Post-Processing stage. Vertex shaders have a 1:1 ratio of vertices input to vertices output. Each vertex shader invocation gets one vertex in and writes one vertex out., 35124=For example, if the total output component count is 1024 (the smallest maximum value from GL 4.3), and the output stream writes to 12 components, the total number of vertices that can be written is 1024/12 = 85. This is the absolute hard limit to the number of vertices that can be written; even if GL_MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_VERTICES is larger than 85, because each vertex takes up 12 components, the true maximum that this particular geometry shader can write is 85 vertices.}","The input_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹ type must match the primitive type used with the rendering command that renders with this shader program. The valid values for input_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹, along with the valid OpenGL primitive types, are: layout(input_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹) in; Each geometry shader is designed to accept a specific Primitive type as input and to output a specific primitive type. The accepted input primitive type is defined in the shader:  Primitive in/out specification The other feature was GS instancing, which allows multiple invocations to operate over the same input primitive. This makes layered rendering easier to implement and possibly faster performing, as each layer's primitive(s) can be computed by a separate GS instance.  In OpenGL 4.0, GS's gained two new features: the ability to write to multiple output streams. This is used exclusively with transform feedback, such that different feedback buffer sets can get different transform feedback data.    Transform Feedback: This is often employed for doing computational tasks on the GPU (obviously pre-Compute Shader).  Layered rendering: taking one primitive and rendering it to multiple images without having to change bound rendertargets and so forth.  While the GS can be used to amplify geometry, implementing a form of tessellation, this is not the primary use for the feature. The general uses for GS's are:  Geometry shader invocations take a single Primitive as input and may output zero or more primitives.","The vertex count is the number of vertices that the GS receives per-input primitive. The output primitive type is defined as follows: layout(output_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹, max_vertices = vert_countÃ¢Â€Â‹) out; The output_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹ may be one of the following: pointsÃ¢Â€Â‹ line_stripÃ¢Â€Â‹ triangle_stripÃ¢Â€Â‹ These work exactly the same way their counterpart OpenGL rendering modes do. To output individual triangles or lines, simply use EndPrimitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹ (see below) after emitting each set of 3 or 2 vertices. There must be a max_verticesÃ¢Â€Â‹ declaration for the output. The number must be a compile-time constant, and it defines the maximum number of vertices that will be written by a single invocation of the GS. It may be no larger than the implementation-defined limit of MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_VERTICES. The minimum value for this limit is 256. See the limitations below.

Each of the TIAA-CREF Lifecycle Funds is designed to provide a single diversified portfolio managed with a target retirement date in mind. The target date is the approximate date when investors expect to begin withdrawing money from the fund. Each portfolio invests in several underlying equity and fixed-income funds offered by the TIAA-CREF Funds. Currently, the Lifecycle 2015 Fund's target allocation consists of an equity/fixed-income mix of approximately 50%/50%. Over time, the fund's target allocation will gradually become more conservative, reaching an equity/fixed-income mix of approximately 40%/60% between 2022-2025. The fund may deviate from these target allocations by up to 10% depending upon current market conditions and outlook., 26979=1The fund's Retirement Class began operations on 10/15/2004. Performance shown for the Since Inception period and prior to the inception of the Premier Class is based on the performance of the fund's Retirement Class. Performance has not been restated to reflect the lower expenses of the Premier Class. If the expense differential had been reflected, performance for these periods would have been higher., 27936=Morningstar is an independent service that rates mutual funds and variable annuities. For each fund/account with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingÃ¢Â„Â¢ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's/account's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Where applicable, Morningstar's performance rankings are based on linked performance that considers the differences in expense ratios, while actual performance data shown does not reflect such differences. The top 10 percent of funds/accounts in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5 percent receive four stars, and the next 35 percent receive three stars, the next 22.5 percent receive two stars and the bottom 10 percent receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund/account within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Morningstar proprietary ratings on U.S.-domiciled funds/accounts reflect historical risk-adjusted performance, are subject to change every month. They are derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Target date mutual funds are actively managed, so their asset allocations are subject to change and may vary from those shown.
