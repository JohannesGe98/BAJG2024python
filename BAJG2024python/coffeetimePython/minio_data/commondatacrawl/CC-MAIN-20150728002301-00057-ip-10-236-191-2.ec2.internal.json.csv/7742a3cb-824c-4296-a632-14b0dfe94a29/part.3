And, if you live in a dorm you have to use a meal plan. Most people after their first year choose to live off campus."", ""Most GE classes are fairly easy, though the upper division courses are much harder, so I've heard. If you study hard though, you'll do fine."", ""Don't stress out too much in your first year: most GE classes are fairly easy. It's going to probably be hard to make friends at first, so don't be worried if you find yourself alone for a few days. To remedy this, go join some clubs and try to hang out with people in your dorm. Try and have as much fun as you can without going crazy."", ""SDSU is so much more than just another party school. In my first semester alone, I've already had my views challenged, my knowledge enriched, and have made friendships I know will last a lifetime.

This amazing perk of being a student, along with free sporting events and tons of discounts, is where your tuition money really gets useful.', 'Basketball games are the all time best way to have fun at SDSU. With our team ranked high in the entire nation, our basketball arena gets packed with students, parents, and fans all over San Diego. The whole place rumbles as the fans scream for our team and nothing feels more exhilarating than feeling a part of something so great. Not only sports, but also gym activities such as lifting, fitness classes, rock climbing, and also swimming are among the awesome things to do for fun.', 'San Diego State has food stores all over campus and they all taste great. My personal favorite is the Panda Express up in the East Commons building, but there are tons more shops and restaurants around campus as well. The food is delicious and very convenient in between classes or even just to come hang out with friends.', 'Although I have not lived in a dorm myself, I have many friends in dorms and they absolutely love it. It is such a great way to make a load of new friends and stay active in the campus. One can even sign up with the meal plan and get a bunch of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Dorm life is definitely a fun and exciting way to live in college.', 'Academics are the top priority for students. Luckily here at SDSU, the professors are so helpful and always willing to make appointments within office hours to see students and talk about grades or even get help in a subject if needed. As long as one seems to take pride and care in their classes, then professors will be most accommodating.', 'When preparing to come to SDSU, one must bring the following: shorts, sunglasses, and an open mind. San Diego weather is beautiful so bring the right clothing. Also, if possible, bring a bicycle. It really helps to have a ride to and from campus. And last, take advantage of the perks of being an SDSU Aztec, such as free sporting events, tons of discounts on local businesses, and intramural sports and activities.', 'San Diego State University has some of the best teaching staff in the nation, with professors who are renowned for their own research in their prospective fields. The college area is so much fun to walk around and experience with friends and family. Not only are the classes great and the professors insightful, but also the campus is massive, providing a great workout when traveling from class to class.']]",San Diego State University (SDSU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/San-Diego-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/38543,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,171,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00057-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,900906607,900706046,HORIZONTAL,"07/11/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 105 out of 112 people found this review useful. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 278 Jaime from San Diego, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

What more can you ask for?', 'Joining greek is a great way to find your niche, to find your rightful place here at SDSU. You will have the once in a lifetime opportunity to have countless brothers and sisters you never had by joining a fraternity or sorority. Your social network will bloom exponentially as you get to know many others in the greek system. Here is where you will solidify unique bonds with others that you will be close to. Here is where you will make close friends that will last a lifetime. Greek is where you can let loose, enjoy that social lifestyle, and graduate SDSU in style and class.', ""The number of clubs on campus are staggeringly high. There's a club for everyone and they welcome all students. Joining one of these school organizations is something you will not forget or regret."", 'SDSU is ideal for those who wish to better themselves and make life-changing decisions that will benefit them in the future. SDSU is perfect for those who want to grow inside and out. SDSU is the right college for those who wish to obtain a worthy and prestigious education.', 'Among all the crazy traditions here at SDSU, one in particular has gained notoriety. The Undie Run is a school sponsored tradition. It involves SDSU students donating their clothes and running around campus in their underwear. Now of course it would not be a school sponsored event if it was not going towards a good cause. The piles and piles of stripped clothing gets donated to local charities. Its a win-win for everyone involved. Students get to see what their fellow peers are made of and clothing is given to the homeless and to people who need them the most.', 'There is no doubt that higher education is expensive. You will go zero in that bank account and your wallet will feel empty numerous times throughout your stay at SDSU. But one should not put a price tag on something so priceless. You should not miss out on something just because someone slapped a ridiculously high price tag on it. Being an Aztec at SDSU is a golden and priceless opportunity. One should not shy away from this opportunity because of that high dollar amount. Get loans, scholarships, and a job or two and enjoy the long-term benefits of being a college student.', ""It's college! The possibility and options for fun and mayhem are endless. Welcome Week alone provides current students with an avenue to have fun and enjoy their time here at SDSU. Sure, there are no playgrounds or jungle gyms in sight, but you're a college student now. You want to enjoy what college has to offer. Join the many school clubs and organizations that enjoy the same passions and aspirations as you do. Join greek and let loose in a lifestyle that will change you socially for the better. Given the fact that SDSU is in pretty close proximity to San Diego beaches, make friends and soak up the rays on the beach. The possibilities for fun here at SDSU are countless."", 'It is campus cuisine so if you are looking for a five star restaurant, you better look elsewhere. Especially as a freshman who dorms for an entire year, you are going to get too used to the food on campus that you will definitely miss real home cooking. Regardless, the food possibilities are vast on campus to the point where you should not go hungry. It may be overpriced but it is campus food. Once again, what do you expect? As long as it keeps you content enough to survive the entire day without your stomach eating itself, the food and dining here at SDSU has done its job.', 'I lived in a dorm when I was a freshman all those semesters ago. Living in a dormitory is the first time, for most people, to finally separate themselves from parental dependence. It is a true landmark for adulthood, especially for those straight out of high school. Is it a life-changing experience that will challenge your capabilities of living independent for a year? It is undoubtedly so. Is it worth the extremely high cost? In my honest opinion, it is not. But I have come to the realization that I am one of the few who did not completely enjoy the dorm life.', ""Academics here is fully stressed, promoted, and drilled. There is no easy A but as long as you are willing to put in the time and effort to retain information and knowledge, you will do perfectly fine as you pursue that Bachelor's degree. Not every professor at SDSU is perfect, but they are here as mentors and they will go out of their way to see you succeed and achieve you true potential. This is college. What do expect?"", 'To all those incoming freshman out there, prepare for a life-changing experience. Life here at SDSU is nothing like the ordinary, everyday lifestyle of high school. Prepare to be bombarded with knowledge and facts from well-trained, fully knowledgeable professors. Be fully aware that you will have to put in a good amount of work as you spend the next 4 years or more of your life here at this university. Get ready to make memories that you will want to remember, and some you will want to forget. Be aware that during this process, you will make a name for yourself and a good amount of friends, some of which you will stick with for the rest of your life. Most importantly, be open-minded and be ready to leave the comforts of your comfort zone. In order to grow here, you must be willing to change for the better.', 'If you are looking for a university that will transform you into the intellectual, social butterfly you were always destined to be, San Diego State University is the college for you.

In front of the ARC (university gym) there is a Shakesmart where you can order post workout shakes, acai bowls, or any other kind of shake. All of the places I mentioned take your meal plan, which is the best part! My favorite part of the food here is the farmer's market on Thursdays.

This final rule is effective on July 27, 2015. 40 CFR Part 60 and 63 Summary This action finalizes amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants. On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the NESHAP and the new source performance standards (NSPS) for the Portland cement industry. Subsequently, the EPA became aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and thus issued a proposal to correct these errors on November 19, 2014 (79 FR 68821). The EPA received 3 comments on the proposal. In response to the comments received and to complete technical corrections, the EPA is now issuing final amendments.

The Fertilizer Institute has requested the extension in order to allow more time to review the proposed rule and associated emissions data, risk assessment and technology review., 28550=On February 24, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a direct final rule approving the updated delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources) to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 212205=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to correct and clarify certain text of the final action titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units,Ã¢Â€? which was published in the Federal Register of Thursday, February 16, 2012. We are also proposing to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense for malfunction events in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 78817=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAPs promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between April 13, 2004 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is taking direct final action to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 283025=In this action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes that it has completed its statutory obligation of the Clean Air Act to promulgate emissions standards for source categories accounting for not less than ninety percent of the aggregated emissions of each of the seven hazardous air pollutants enumerated in section 112(c)(6).

In this action, the EPA is also proposing a limited number of technical corrections and amendments to the final rule to correct inadvertent errors and to clarify some applicability and implementation issues raised by stakeholders subject to the final rule. Also, we propose to delete rule provisions for an affirmative defense for malfunction in light of a recent court decision on the issue. The EPA is seeking comment only on the five issues being reconsidered, the proposed deletion of the affirmative defense and on the technical corrections and amendments described in the preceding paragraph. The EPA will not respond to any comments addressing any other issues or any other provisions of the final rule., 324518=On February 12, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized amendments to the national emission standards for the control of hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) from the new and existing Portland cement manufacturing industry at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). Subsequently, the EPA has become aware of certain minor technical errors in those amendments, and is, accordingly, proposing amendments and technical corrections to the final rule. In addition, the EPA plans to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense in the final technical correction rule., 8785=This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Ferroalloys Production source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). These final amendments include revisions to particulate matter (PM) standards for electric arc furnaces, metal oxygen refining processes, and crushing and screening operations, and expand and revise the requirements to control process fugitive emissions from furnace operations, tapping, casting, and other processes. We are also finalizing opacity limits, as proposed in 2014. However, regarding opacity monitoring, in lieu of Method 9, we are requiring monitoring with the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT). Furthermore, we are finalizing emissions standards for four previously unregulated hazardous air pollutants (HAP): Formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury (Hg) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).

Jurkat cells (T-cell leukemia, human) were treated with (A) DMSO or (B) 10 Ã‚ÂµM camptothecin for 3 hours before labeling with the CellEventÃ‚Â® Caspase 3/7 Green Flow Cytometry kit. Stained samples were analyzed on the AttuneÃ‚Â® Acoustic Focusing Cytometer equipped with a 488-nm laser, and fluorescence emission was collected using a 530/30 BP filter for CellEventÃ‚Â® Caspase 3/7 Green Detection Reagent and a 690/50BP filter for SYTOXÃ‚Â® AADvancedÃ¢Â„Â¢ stain, respectively. Note that the treated cells have a higher percentage of apoptotic cells (panel B) than the basal level of apoptosis seen in the control cells (panel A). A =apoptotic cells, V = viable cells, N = necrotic cells. Enlarge CellEventÃ‚Â® Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent is a cell-permeant reagent that consists of a four-amino acid peptide (DEVD) conjugated to a nucleic acid-binding dye. During apoptosis, caspase-3 and caspase-7 proteins are activated and able to cleave the caspase 3/7 recognition sequence encoded in the DEVD peptide. Cleavage of the recognition sequence and binding of DNA by the reagent labels the apoptotic cells with a bright, fluorogenic signal that has absorption/emission maxima of ~511/533 nm. When used together with the SYTOXÃ‚Â® AADvancedÃ¢Â„Â¢ Dead Cell Stain, apoptotic cells can be easiliy discriminated from live and necrotic cells.","Figure 1.

If you want to live to 100 or beyond, research suggests that telomere maintenance may be the number one key strategy you can employ. As research continues and the average lifespan increases, what was once considered science fiction is becoming reality. Consider adding Telomere Advantage Formula to your daily supplement regimen and, to quote a popular science fiction character, ""Live long and prosper."" The new research suggests that telomere shortening may be responsible for cellular senescence. Each time a cell divides, telomeres are shortened. The telomerase enzyme appears to help offset this phenomenon, keeping telomeres long even as cells divide and replicate. As we live out our lives, our cells constantly divide in order to maintain our physical being. As we age, however, this process slows down and in some cases, eventually stops entirely. Scientists have known of this phenomenon for years and have even given it a name: cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is behind just about everything we associate with aging, from visible signs like the decline in healthy skin tissue to hidden events within the body like tissue degeneration, mental decline and organ failure. The answer to long life may not be any magical","*Daily Value not established.
