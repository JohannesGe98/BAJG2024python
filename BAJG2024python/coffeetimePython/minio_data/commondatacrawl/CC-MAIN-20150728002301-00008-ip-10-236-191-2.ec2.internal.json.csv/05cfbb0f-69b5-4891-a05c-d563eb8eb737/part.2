PI3-kinases play roles in signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, cell survival, cell migration, and intracellular protein trafficking. This protein contains a lipid kinase catalytic domain as well as a C-terminal C2 domain, a characteristic of class II PI3-kinases. C2 domains act as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding motifs that mediate translocation of proteins to membranes, and may also mediate protein-protein interactions. The PI3-kinase activity of this protein is sensitive to low nanomolar levels of the inhibitor wortmanin. The C2 domain of this protein was shown to bind phospholipids but not Ca2+, which suggests that this enzyme may function in a calcium-independent manner.

A great glacier and archaeological site dating back to 1916 are found at Dundas. It is also a perfect place for you to head out on a hike, taking in the sights, sounds and colors of the Arctic summer. Qaanaaq is one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s most northern settlements. You can enjoy the colorful buildings here, which present a great contrast to the surrounding landscape. A visit to the local museum is a wonderful way for you to gain a deeper appreciation for what it takes to live this far north., 9624=Exploring the Canadian High Arctic, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll have numerous hiking and birding opportunities. The first of which usually takes place at Dundas Harbor on Devon Island. Your beach hike here will be high- lighted by visiting the remains of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police post dating back to 1924. This area has been settled for thousands of years by the Palae-Eskimo, Thule and, now, Inuit. DonÃ¢Â€Â™t be surprised if your Canadian history walk is interrupted by walrus, which are some- times hauled out on the beach nearby.}"

Enormous though he is, Toddie's still young to be on his own, so Ma warns, ""You better hold on to me. We don't want to lose you."" But though Toddie is pretty conspicuous, looming as he does above the New York City crowds, she and Pa lose sight of him. Alarmed at first, the boy soon makes friends with normal-sized toddlers in Central Park, who enlist him in games like London Bridge (Toddie's the bridge). He visits the museum dinosaurs (""Nice doggie!""), then climbs the Empire State Building, King Kongfashion, and spies his relieved parents. The story extends to the endpapers, with Toddie perched atop the southbound train from Maine in front and, at the end, Lady Liberty (apparently an unauthorized souvenir) riding a train back to New York, secured with giant bungee cords, NYPD helicopters hovering. It's not easy being big, but it's a great source of humor in Hawkes's energetic, cartoony illustrations of the winsome giant and the spacious scenes he dwarfs, where almost everyone matter-of-factly accepts his presence. If there's less comical engineering here than the first time out, the logical development still provides plenty of laughs.

Messi's contribution is immeasurable but Barca coach Vilanova is adamant the club's success is not only down to the Argentina forward. He told reporters: ""It's no great revelation to say that Messi is decisive, but Leo doesn't win games by himself. ""You have to create chances, know how to defend... It's too simplistic to say Barca is just Messi. ""Leo is very good but we need all the players because only one cannot win a game."" Barca went into the match having earned 31 points from a possible 33 this term and they always looked likely to pick up another three last night. Vilanova said: ""Whenever we have a match, I always think we can win it, but the truth is that winning 11 games in a row is a great run. The team is where it is this season because the players are hungry to win."" The match was also marked by the returns of Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol, who played together for the first time since April with both players having suffered injuries.

The Neighborhood Enhancement Program is funded through Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Disaster Recovery monies provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Christie Administration has directed $379 million of these funds for programs designed to replenish the stock of rental housing throughout Sandy-affected areas, repair affordable rental units left uninhabitable by the storm, and provide affordable housing for residents in need. The State anticipates that approximately 7,000 new affordable housing units statewide will be created over the next two years as a result of these affordable rental housing programs. The 15 loans announced today are for projects in Atlantic, Essex, Monmouth, Ocean and Union counties. The projects range from building single-family for sale houses to rehabbing older residential properties into rental housing to constructing new rental homes and apartments. The Neighborhood Enhancement Program provides up to $250,000 in subsidy per housing unit for project-related capital costs including construction costs, professional fees, financing fees, acquisition, demolition and development contingencies.Ã‚Â The other counties most impacted by Sandy are Bergen, Cape May, Hudson, and Middlesex.

Yes, it is being described as a 'how-to-cope-with-puperty' novel but for me it is more. It is magical and disturbing at times."", ""Written after Hamsun's return from an ill-fated tour of America, Hunger is loosely based on the author's own impoverished life before his breakthrough in 1890. Set in late 19th century Kristiania, the novel recounts the adventures of a starving young man whose sense of reality is giving way to a delusionary existence on the darker side of a modern metropolis. While he vainly tries to maintain an outer shell of respectability, his mental and physical decay are recounted in detail. His ordeal, enhanced by his inability or unwillingness to pursue a professional career, which he deems unfit for someone of his abilities, is pictured in a series of encounters which Hamsun himself described as 'a series of analyses.' In many ways, the protagonist of the novel displays traits reminiscent of Raskolnikov[citation needed], whose creator, Fyodor Dostoevsky, was one of Hamsun's main influences. The influence of naturalist authors such as Emile Zola is apparent in the novel, as is his rejection of the realist tradition."", 'Ingeborg Bachmann is one of the most influential German language writers and poets of post WWII. Her writings convey power and intense emotion even when diluted through translation into other languages. Her poems retain an immediate, rhythmic quality that is simply captivating. A true contemporary of Sylvia Plath in themes and feminist power and class struggles, it is a shame Ingeborg is not as well known the world over, especially among American poetry enthusiasts.', ""A touching account of a woman's life in Berlin during the occupation of the city by the Red Army (post WWII). The author's cruel and straight-forward style is equally poetic. The experience of women in war-occupied zones, is a page of history which is not often dealt with, and which should not be ignored."", 'Because it is extremely funny but also deep and philosophical. It contents a lot of brilliant aphorisms and apothegms. A classic.', ""Written in 1933, this is an astonishingly powerful novel about the effects of Nazism on one upper-middle-class Jewish German family. The action starts a few months (I think) before Hitler comes to power and ends about a year later, by which time the family, and its comfortable place in Berlin society, has been utterly destroyed (one member of the family, an idealistic schoolboy, is eventually driven to suicide by the Nazification of his school, which is immediately forced to teach subjects like history and German literature through a Nazi filter; another ends up in an early concentration camp). Feuchtwanger started writing it in January '33, so as he wrote he was only a few months ahead of his characters, giving the book an extraordinarily immediate feel. I read it as a German-studying university undergraduate as part of a course devoted to novels published outside of Germany during the Nazi period by anti-Nazi German writers and it made a huge impression on me - I've only read it in German so I have no idea how good (or bad) the current American translation of it is. But the original is fantastic."", ""It's a fun, picaresque novel about a young man travelling through Italy in the early 1800s. It's reminiscent of Tom Jones or Joseph Andrews."", ""Sobs of a clown left meandering through Bonn with no religion and the ability to identify smells through the telephone. With this, the novel mixes social, religious, and political commentary about the era during and after The War. Boll's critique of the Roman Catholic Church and the role it played in Europe at the time is significant."", ""Wonderfully witty book with a serious subject by a man who knew his subject. The book is about how a Dutch couple hide a Jewish man, what it's like to have a stranger in your house and what they do when he dies and they have a corpse to dispose of."", 'Kafka\'s ""Metamorphosis"" was the ""work of the day"" on Project Gutenberg\'s site. I thought the title sounded interesting enough and admittedly, I knew it would be about an individual\'s change of heart. I looked forward to reading the story. Sadly, I had only heard about Kafka - that he was a writer. Nothing about his personal life or his writings. Kafka\'s words were so defining and real. The thought process to create such a work left me in awe and empathetic to his person. I was so concerned for how he must have grown up that it encouraged me read biographies of his life and his works. I now make it my business to read whatever he has written. ""Metamorphosis"" was such a powerful work for me that I had to read it twice, and I find myself recommending it to others. The online version is a standard part of my e-reader, and I am searching for the book (in its rare form) for my collection. I have been reading for such a long time. John Steinbeck\'s ""Of Mice and Men"" has been my favorite work since my teenage years. ""Metamorphosis"" is now added to that list. By the way, I was not sure which country you were requesting - my country or the country of the work. My country is the United States.', ""It's easy to forget just how skilful, approachable and dazzling contemporary German fiction can be when we look at the great works of the past."", ""What's not to love about this book? Not only is it a fantastic fantasy read it's also a statement/warning about the loss of imagination and reading. In this world of reality TV this theme is even more relevant today than it was 32 years ago."", ""A wonderful young short story writer, Wetzel is incredibly skilled at taking us into the complex internal worlds of her characters. They're often troubled teenagers, tasting love or disappointment or anger for the first time. Several of the stories are set against the backdrop of the late 80s and early 90s (the time of Wetzel's own childhood), with the fall of the Wall ubiquitous behind the personal rifts and reunifications of Wetzel's teenage characters."", 'You have to read it yourself. This book refreshed my mind.', 'Germans have humour! Apart from its literary value the book is about an important epoch of German culture, covering science and humanities. What more to expect?!', 'The list of my favourite German writers is long, and I was recently reminded of this book I had read as a child. It is the most frightening thing I have ever read: that such people could actually exist, people who steal time. And as I grew up, turns out, Ende was not far from the terrifying truth: they do exist, time is being stolen. There is something about childrens books that speak with much more terror to the grown up reader.', ""BÃƒÂ¶ll's Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum is a prescient novella about the sensationalist and immoral methods of the tabloid press. It also has historical interest as a commentary on 1970s West German society."", 'Absolutely fantastic. Each time I see a story where the media are lampooning a person or celebrity I am reminded of this story. If only everybody could get their revenge.....', 'An account of the political sensitivities after WW II using the art scene as a framework (expressionism which was defamed art - Entartete Kunst - during the Third Reich). A book not to put away until finished.', ""Kurt Tucholsky is one of Germany's wittiest writers. He was a poet, novelist, songwriter, critic, publisher, satirist and political writer in the Weimar republic. He constantly warned against the Nazi threat and his works were later banned in the Theird Reich. His sharp and witty writing style is among the best in German literature. Unfortunately, he's hardly known outside Germany."", 'Classic novella of the romantic period. A gothic horror exploring ideas of hubris and human/machine interaction at the dawn of the industrial age.', ""The journey of Siddhartha -from birth to 'enlightenment'- with all its trials and tribulations, joys and heartaches, achievemments and losses, discoveries and learnings is described in the most concise, eloquent, precise and deep way imaginable. Most authors would need to write a few books to convey what Hesse conveys within this short novel. An absolute classic."", ""One of the modernist greats of the Weimar era, Fallada wrote powerful, but accessible and popular prose. His most famous novel 'Kleiner Mann, was nun?' Ã¢\x80\x93 a 'Grapes of Wrath'-style story about the downfall of a young family during the Great Depression, published in 1932 Ã¢\x80\x93 is still a tremendous and relevant read, especially in today's credit crisis. A modern classic."", ""A modernist interpretation of the Pieter Brueghel painting. Six blind men are taken to the artist's studio, and attempt to make some kind of sense of what is going on. Sparse, haunting, and at times painfully funny in the kind of desperate way that Beckett can be funny."", ""KÃƒÂ¤stner was born and grew up in Dresden/ Germany, and this city was basically his first and everlasting love. He describes his childhood and youth in the city and is thus reflecting on the huge changes the city and the whole country was undergoing from the year of his birth 1899 onwards. He was a critic, a pacifist and a journalist who also wrote plays and peotry but is best known for hs childrens books. I read the book first when I was seven, then at fourteen. I reread it at the age of 19 and 22 - it's been a different experience every time, but always great. It's an emotional recollection of KÃƒÂ¤snters memories, half a century old but incredibly captivating. Never met anyone who didn't enjoy it."", 'Kayankaya, the detective of this crime novel is, like the author, a German of Turkish descent so as well as the typical detective noir story you get to experience the racism immigrants are facing in the German city he works through his eyes.', ""I've read books by Thomas Mann, Patrick Suskind, Gunter Grass, Theodor Storm, Joseph Roth and Heinrich Boll, the first and last of which particularly impressed me. Hermann Hesse, however, became one of the few writers who's books, after reading one, I wanted to read all of. They're acheingly beautiful; deeply lyrical and melancholic, evoking a very personalized and nostalgic sense of lost youth. They're also full of tenderness; these stories don't leave you feeling pessimistic despite the often bittersweet content. 'Peter Camenzind' might just about be my favourite, but I could equally have chosen 'Knulp', 'Klingsor's Last Summer', 'Narziss and Goldmund' or 'Steppenwolf'."", 'Just read it please.', '', '', 'Fontane (1819-1898) was an author, who was great on portraying women- especially those, who were under pressure. tThe circumstances in late 19th century were not easy for women, they had scarce opprtunities like education, voting rights, freedom of choosing her partner. Fontane portrayed those women, if they were bourgeois or aristocrats, with humor, sympathy and intelligence. One of these is corinna, intelligent and educated, daughter of Professor Schmidt. She has her own plans about her future and wants to seduce rich Leopold Treibel, although her dad wants her to marry her cousin. Two families meet, that have already -and also romantic-relationships in the past. Loads of funny dialogues! Fontane is best known for ""Effie Briest"" and ""Der Stechlin"". He also wrote ballads and poems. Another author who followed him in terms of literarily technics and who admired Fontane, was Nobel Prize Winner Thomas Mann (1875 - 1955).', '', 'Exquisite writing, and remarkable that any author can find a new and relevant way to tell stories based on (relatively speaking) recent German history. Just when you thought there was no new way to present events and evoke lives in (and around) Germany in the first half of the 20th century, just when you fretted that constant Holocaust-based references were giving us an emotional free pass not to bother our heads thinking of all the other horrors in the world - the ones we do nothing about in our own lifetimes - along comes Erpenbeck with something that makes you react and understand in a new way.', ""This autobiography of the author of 'Mephisto' portrays the hopes of Weimar Germany followed by its collapse into Nazism - and the end of Germany as Mann knew it. Indeed, during his exile in the USA, Mann joined the US Army and contributed to the liberation of his country, whilst also reporting on postwar Germany for the American press. Such was his sense of rootlessness in the society devastated by Nazism and war that he felt alone and adrift in postwar Germany. The readers' knowledge of Mann's suicide in 1949 adds to the sombre mood of this text, which spirals into an abyss and shows no recovery despite the end of the war in a liberated - albeit fractured - Germany. A truly great account of socio-moral collapse and the irreparable loss to one man."", '""Das MÃƒÂ¼nchen-Komplott"" by Wolfgang Schorlau is a thriller which re-examines the bomb attack at the Oktoberfest in Munich in 1980. This was the worst act of terrorism in post-war Germany and Schorlau makes a convincing case for it being state-sponsored. His other thrillers with the same central figure, Georg Dengler, a former Bundeskriminalamt investigator turned private eye, also look at the darker side of Germany, past and present. I don\'t think any of these are available in English.', ""It tells the story of the essence of imagination, its importance to our survival and enjoyment of life in in the face of political and social stupidity. That imagination saves us from ourselves, along with organisation, and can lead us in to a more positive future. Ivo deals with the former Yugoslavia republics and states with a vast visionary approach and makes us realise how important it is to hear everyone's story -all stories are important in the making of humanity. Ivo Andric was made literary laureate in 1961 for his incredible understanding of the area he lived in."", ""Any New Europe literature tour that cannot place Kafka will be fatally taken. However, before that bitter end, I'd like to recommend Rafik Schami. Unlike his novels - set mostly in Syria - his stories narrate migration and immigration in Germany. Like his novels, though, his volume, Das Letzte Wort der Wanderratte, draws on oral storytelling and fantastic plots. The best story of the lot would be Als der Meister auftrat, where the migrant takes the skin of a modern day Siegfried only to rue the effort at assimilation."", 'Demian is not just a book - it\'s a revelation. Hesse is one of the few authors whose books have a certain magic to it. A magic of style and of depth. The famous psychologist C.G. Jung once called this rather short (less than 200 pages) and accessible book ""a beacon of light in a stormy sea"". Why did he do that? Because there is a malaise at the heart of modern time. A malaise of superficiality and a general feeling of incompleteness. This book is not a cure, but it gives names to thing that are so far away from the normal discourse of the media that they can be considered largely forgotten. It\'s an awakening of the subconscious; breathing life into facets of the human mind one did not even entirely knew existed, but whose abscence - while not being understood - is felt clearly.', '', ""Onetti is great at conjuring worlds out of imagination. After a long absence, Larsen (a middle-aged former brothel-owner) is back in his fictional hometown of Santa MarÃƒ\xada, a backwater place where nothing happens (on the surface at least), with a scheme for getting his hands on the fortune of the town's entrepreneur, the shipyard's owner. Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti, who has been compared to William Faulkner and Graham Greene, is a great author to begin for those of you who are tired of magical realism --- and even more so for those who think that Latin American literature has nothing to offer but luxuriant vegetation and family sagas involving magic-working grandmothers. If you want to set stereotypes aside and embark on a strange journey through a bleak landscape, Onetti is your man."", '', 'The characters are colorful and unlike the normal ""how the hero developed"" stories, the hero also gets hit with reality that there are others like him. The book takes its time to get to its point, but it\'s not dull. Moers allows the characters to develop, while the plot stews.', ""Goethe is of Shakespearean stature and is as fertile and hard to pin down as our own greatest writer. He reinvented himself several times as an artist over a long lifetime, and wrote great novels and plays as well as magnificent poetry. But the glory of Goethe is his poetry.

It\'s the fictionalised story of the six ""members"" of the White Rose in a gripping tale. What makes the book extra special is that Neumann was in America during WW II and read about the arrest of the six in a newspaper there. He wrote the whole book based on the little information that article contained. It turned out later that he had been far more acurate than he could have hoped for. See this site for more information: http://neglectedbooks.com/?p=147 It\'s not only the best German book I ever read, it is also one of the best books overall I\'ve had the pleasure of coming across.

It's a getaway story of two Berlin youngsters driving an old Lada southwards, written in vivid languague. There were few critics who didn't mention Salinger... It's not too elaborate, but at the same time very gripping. The author restarted the book when he got diagnosed with a brain tumor.

You are left in no doubt as to the fact that any ordinary people in any ordinary society anywhere can contribute to a society's wrongs, if by nothing else than keeping silent as teeny tiny steps are taken in the wrong direction, one after the other after the other."", ""Historical fiction that thinks big and small at the same time. Equally sharp on the provincial life of the Germany of the time and on the opening up of new geographical and intellectual horizons across the world.

His songs and his novels as well, manage to be sentimental (more the songs) and funny (more the novels) at the same time (without getting on your nerves). Neue Vahr SÃƒÂ¼d is the prequel to Herr Lehmann (translated as ""Berlin Blues"") and the second of three novels focusing on Herr Lehmann. To me it is even more amusing than the first part. The novel tells us about the time that Frank Lehmann is still in Bremen, lives in a flatshare and goes to the Bundeswehr (armed forces) at the same time.', ""Like many 16 year olds doing History for GCSE, the hardest hitting topic was Nazi Germany. As the cornerstone of the UK history curriculum (along with the Tudors), it's not easy to deal with at 8am every week. You learn to resent the period and have a superfical sense there must have been something wrong with the Germans. I digress, this book is simply the best human perspective I've ever read on Nazi Germany. It's not only beautifully written and translated, but a really humbling book about making assertions or sterotyping people. It really explains why people were persuaded by Nazism, including the authors friends and colleagues.

It transports the atmosphere of the time and also shares the hopes, dreams but also desilluision of the protagonist as he and some of his friends and their families are struggling in the changing setting. In my opinion Meyer has a brilliantly dense style, which makes the book a gem.', ""I enjoyed Faulks' 'Birdsong', but this book is in an altogether different league!"", ""History just repeats itself.

This book (in three volumes) is, in my view, altogether more accessible than Peter Handke and less accessible than GÃƒÂ¼nter Grass or Herta MÃƒÂ¼ller but also much less in love with itself than any of these writers, thank god.

At the same time, a great coming-of-age novel about the book\'s central character, a Lieutenant Melzer. Written in realist style on the surface, but radical at the core. Great sense of rhythm.', 'The book is a historical satire that spans the end of Weimar Republic to the Nazi era.In a funny and highly ironic text and it is also a critique towards the general style of books about that time. A boy who refused to grow up but with the mind of an adult. Dark humour even about the cooking of spaghetti.

Moers does this sort of thing extraordinarily well - in terms of structure, this book is not so very different from his better-known children's episodic novel 'The 13 1/2 lives of Captain Bluebear' (also excellent fun, by the way)."", ""It's a thoroughly entertaining satire of the 'hard-boiled ' detective genre, narrated by a cat.

Great fun- I'd happily read the rest of the series if they were translated into English."", 'BÃƒÂ¼chner is an incredible author and achieved a lot in his short life. Though perhaps better known as a playwright, this short prose fragment is my favourite of all of his works. Written in 1835, it shows a shockingly modern insight into mental illness and schizophrenia in particular. The language is dense and beautiful. The opening page is perhaps one of the greatest examples of prose in German, if not World literature.', ""Wolf is one of my favourite German authors. Her books frequently deal with questions about memory, identity and her concept of 'subjective authenticity' which are of course still relevant today and to those living outside Germany, but which also provide an important insight into the task faced by those living in the GDR of coming to terms with their Nazi past in the face of their Communist present. Wolf's texts ask how people were supposed to have any true sense of identity when the world surrounding them and the ideas they were expected to adopt kept changing so drastically. In Kassandra she addresses these problems against the backdrop of the Trojan war and asks questions about what it means to have a voice and to stay true to this voice even in the face of great adversity. The book is also interesting when considered as part of the tendency of German authors to go back to ancient Greek culture and is an interesting counterpoint to authors such as Goethe who admired Greek culture for its harmony and close relationship to nature. It's also a prime example of Wolf's feminist writing as she goes back to the defeat of the Trojans as the point at which patriarchy, as transmitted by Greek values, started to take over the world in order to see how these structures might be changed for the better in a post-patriarchal society. The book's accompanying essays are also well worth a look and also provide another reading of the story - that is of 'male' aggression and the fear she and her generation lived in of nuclear war."", 'Peter Handke is rather known as the one bashing everyone for everything, literally in his ""Publikumsbeschimpfung"" (public bashing), and later even more ferociously during and after the Balkan war.

As the Detroit News put it for one of his earlier novels ""Moers\' creative mind is like J.K. Rowling\'s on extacy"", and this is to be taken literally. The book combines an extraordinary imagination with a brilliant style of writing. Based in the fictional continent of Zamonia the book follows the footsteps a young dinosaur Optimus Yarnspinner, on his search of the author of the maybe best piece of literature ever written. On his journey he will realise that books are much more than just bound paper. Like in all his novels Moers is not bound by the ties of clichÃƒÂ©, stereotype or even genre. Furthermore this book is a love letter to literature and the reader will soon discover that many of the books characters names are anagrams of real existing authors. The author is well known in Germany. He invented on Germany\'s most famous children character Captain Bluebear, but also contributed many politically very incorrect cartoons to Germany\'s biggest satire magazine Titanic. Recently he has mainly worked on his novels which have become international bestsellers.', ""At 300 pages one of the longest theatrical works ever written, Wallenstein is a chronicle play to rival anything Shakespeare produced. (Though the play was written over two centuries ago, it was only staged in a single performance for the first time in 2007 - by Peter Stein in Berlin.) The tragic, ambiguously motivated figure of Albrecht von Wallenstein - the warlord and powerbroker who might well have brought the appalling Thirty Years War to an early close, is here immortalised by Schiller's astounding command of stagecraft and dialogue. The man's hamartia is his integrity: because he truly believes in honour, he cannot see his betrayal coming. An absolutely compelling play, seething with political intrigue and Schiller's thorough knowledge of the era and his subject. Every other page has a quotable passage or a shimmering insight into human nature and how we are all threatened by inner and outer foes.

I felt sea-sick the whole time.', 'Heinrich BÃƒÂ¶llÃ¢\x80\x99s The Bread of Those Early Years perfectly depicts the struggles of post-war German society. The title says it all: it explores the hunger, not just to survive and succeed but to regain meaning and purpose. It explores the ferociousness of the war-torn and downtrodden German people to get back on their feet again. The story is so powerful, so beautifully written and dripping with striking images and turns of phrase. The symbolism of bread works incredibly well to highlight the social issues BÃƒÂ¶ll was trying to explore in the framework of the story. The narration is so simple, so understated, so matter-of-fact and it really works. Even 56 years after the novella was first published you are in the thick of this desperate society, walking the streets with Walter, meeting Hedwig, seeing the poverty through their eyes, even experiencing it with them. There is the added dimension of a tentative love story between Walter and Hedwig. The strength of emotion between them is not explicit; the reader is allowed to experience it developing as the characters experience it themselves. The most striking moment of the book is HedwigÃ¢\x80\x99s description of her encounter with a stranger who Ã¢\x80\x98accostedÃ¢\x80\x99 her while Walter was not there. She describes with such desperation how she imagined her life with him: Ã¢\x80\x98I didnÃ¢\x80\x99t have much time: one minute, and I lived a whole lifetime at his side...Ã¢\x80\x99 She goes on to describe in poignant detail how she had his children, how she watched him swap his suits, how they celebrated a pay rise, how she became his widow. It is the most striking piece of dialogue I have read. Certainly, BÃƒÂ¶ll and The Bread of Those Early Years deserve to be recommended as one of GermanyÃ¢\x80\x99s literary greats.', ""I translated it and love this short novel about a woman in late '80s/early '90s Berlin.

At least as good as Flaubert in my view, his resurrection in the often provincial (and persistently anti-German) Anglo Saxon literary world is long overdue. ""Irretrievable"" (""Unwiederbringlich"", 1891), in a wonderful translation by Douglas Parmee, is a short historical love story about the decline of a once happy marriage. Fontane sets this beautiful bitter-sweet tale on the Baltic coast and in Copenhagen in the 1840s at a time of crisis and war between Germans and Danes -- the famously obscure ""Schleswig Holstein Question"" which he renders with great accuracy and fascinating insight.

It is set in the metropolitan city of Buchhaim/Bookholm, a place where everything revolves around literature. It is dominated by publishing firms, second-hand bookstores, writer's groups, and so forth. This does not mean that it a place for the meek: Bookholm is a place where literature actually matters, and as a consequence, the book trade in Bookholm is roughly as violent as the crack trade in the Baltimore of The Wire. In this city, dinosaur and aspiring author Hildegunst von Mythenmetz must go on a quest for the writer of what are probably the greatest two pages of fiction ever written. The brilliance of this book is that it is at once a fantasy and adventure novel, and a parody on the world of literature.

Furthermore, its poignant humour has aged remarkably well; most parts of it still make for an utterly hilarious read.

Re-reading this book last summer made me wonder whether today's Europe is that different from 1970s Germany."", ""Just because the lack of German fantasy was brought up - she's a must. She's been called the German J.K. Rowling, and while the latter remains unsurpassed, Funke considers this a compliment and is definitely offering similar quality."", ""I don't even know wether a translation for GablÃƒÂ©'s books exists but it definitely should. She ¨m×ôÃ²B©gŽÄ{›U7‹´&¹é‡ÂÖ®\gàwrites about England during the 100 Years' War and the War of the Roses, much better than any other historical writer I've discovered so far."", ""It' s funny and interesting and informative and very well- written. It's about Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss.It sounds heavy but it isn't. Kehlmann's other books are all good."", ""Stunningly written, subtle and measured, it's an intimate depiction of the domestic life of a Dutch couple who take in a Jewish man during the holocaust. Outside events only filter through brief references and the miniutiae of everyday life is detailed increasingly as tensions grow- both of the couple, and of their 'guest' who is increasingly plagued by the worries, the boredom and claustrophobia of being in hiding. It twists and turns from the farcical, to the mundane, then ironic and tragic."", 'Perutz, whilst not a German himself is hugely popular in Germany. This particlar tale plays out with eye-popping twists that leave you in disbelief (in a postive way) by the end of the book. Perutz is massively overlooked in English literature but his works really delve into metaphysics but in a way that makes you want to follow him. Both The Swedish Cavalier and By Night Under The Stone Bridge are well worth designating a day to and devouring in all their glory.', '', '', ""Everyone seems to know what a great book this is but I just wanted to put in a word for Michael Hofmann's translation. It seems to me to be perfectly judged, just a miracle of taste and irony and humour and a pure pleasure to read. I found there were many passages in the German that I could make no sense of at all in literal translation and I'm so grateful to Michael Hofmann for clearing things up and even making me laugh when I could finally see what Roth meant."", '', 'Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972. Brilliant satirist and commentator of post war Germany. Unfortunately very little of his work is available in translation. Some of his short stories are hilarious and incredibly sharp witted. I originally discovered him while studying German at A level 20 years ago, but he is still rewarding to read in the original and in translation.', 'Can we translate poetry? Obviously Morgensterns poems are beautiful, smart, extremly funny and include some of the most original and hilarious wordplay in German literature - but this translation really is a work of art in itself: it actually manages to adapt both content and rhyme whilst staying true to the wisdom as well as the cheeky charm of the original. So apparently: Yes we can!', ""One of the most gripping crime novels I've read in a long time, yet so short you can devour it in one afternoon. Schenkel has an amazing ability to laconically describe the narrow-mindedness of a 1950s rural German community in which a terrible crime has occurred. An entire family of poor farmers has been cruelly slayed. They weren't popular, but what else lurks behind everyone's appearances? The little novel's structure keeps your eyes glued to the page as gradually, the horrific details of what happened are revealed."", 'Treichels personal family tragedy (his older brother was lost and never found again as child when the parents had to flee the former eastern german territories) is a repeatedly visited topic in his work. So also in ""Der Verlorene"" (The lost one), which depicts a family still deeply traumatized by the war and the loss of their son. I never read a novel where the stiffling atmosphere of the 50\'s and 60\'s has been more authentically and disturbingly described.']]",World literature tour: Germany | Books | theguardian.com,World literature tour: Germany Click heading to sort,http://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2011/mar/21/1?intcmp=239,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,0,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00008-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,742728195,742671683,HORIZONTAL,"theguardian.com, Monday 21 March 2011 08.56 EDT Email Tweet this Share favourite books and authors from or about Germany.

Die Chancen, einen neuen Partner kennenzulernen steigen logischerweise auch mit der Anzahl von PartnerbÃƒÂ¶rsen, bei denen man sich anmeldet. Wo sollte man sich anmelden ? Nachfolgend haben wir die wohl grÃƒÂ¶ssten und erfolgversprechendsten deutschen PartnerbÃƒÂ¶rsen aufgelistet. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir uns bei den meisten kostenfreien, aber auch bei einigen kostenpflichtigen FlirtbÃƒÂ¶rsen angemeldet, um deren Leistungen im einzelnen vergleichen zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Diese Seite beschÃƒÂ¤ftigt sich nun ausschliesslich mit den gratis Angeboten und soll einen kleinen ÃƒÂ¼berblick darÃƒÂ¼ber verschaffen, welche Seiten es ÃƒÂ¼berhaupt gibt, wo man sich anmelden sollte und auch worauf man achten sollte, um seine Ausgaben so gering wie mÃƒÂ¶glich zu halten. Als gratis stufen wir Seiten ein, bei denen die Anmeldung und zumindest die Basisfunktionen unentgeltlich sind. Wer es leid ist, abend fÃƒÂ¼r abend um die HÃƒÂ¤user zu ziehen, um einen neuen Partner kennenzulernen, der kann dies seit geraumer Zeit, dem Internet sei Dank, nun auch bequem von zuhause aus versuchen. Dazu stehen mittlerweile unzÃƒÂ¤hlige kostenpflichtige und auch kostenlose PartnerbÃƒÂ¶rsen zu VerfÃƒÂ¼gung, deren Dienste man in Anspruch nehmen kann, um endlich seinen Traumpartner zu finden. Kostenlose SinglebÃƒÂ¶rsen und PartnerbÃƒÂ¶rsen","Kostenlose und kostenpflichtige Leistungen Alle oben genannten SinglebÃƒÂ¶rsen bieten sowohl eine gratis Anmeldung, sowie auch kostenfreie Basisfunktionen an. Sie bieten jedoch alle auch zusÃƒÂ¤tzliche Funktionen an, die nur als Premium Mitglied nutzbar sind. Hier sollte man genau abwÃƒÂ¤gen, ob eine Premium Mitgliedschaft sinnvoll ist, und ob man diese Zusatzfunktionen unbedingt in Anspruch nehmen muss. GrundsÃƒÂ¤tzlich gilt, es gibt genug Singleseiten mit gratis Funktionen, so daÃƒÂŸ die Suche nach einem Partner nicht unbedingt zwingend auch mit Ausgaben verbunden sein muss.

Die huidige ortografie is in 1946 deur die Japannese regering vasgelÃƒÂª.[2] Toe hiragana aanvanklik geskep is, is dit nie algemeen aanvaar nie. Baie opgevoede mense het gevoel dat dit steeds Sjinees was. In Japan is die gewone skrif (kaisho), die sogenaamde onode (Ã§Â”Â·Ã¦Â‰Â‹, onode?), ""mansskrif"", deur mans gebruik; terwyl die kursiewe skrif (sÃ…?sho) vorm van kanjki deur vroue gebruik is. Hiragana het dus onder vroue gewild geword wat nie toegang gehad het tot dieselfde mate van onderwys as mans nie. Dit het gelei tot die alternatiewe benaming onnade (Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã¦Â‰Â‹, onnade?) ""vroueskrif"".[2] Die","Die hiragana skryfstelsel[wysig | wysig bron] Die hiragana bestaan uit 'n basiese stel karakters, die gojÃ…Â«on, wat op verskeie maniere aangepas kan word. Deur 'n dakuten merker ( Ã£Â‚Â›) word 'n nie-stemhebbende konsonant soos k of t verander in 'n stemhebbende konsonant soos g (uitgespreek soos in berge) of d: kÃ¢Â†Â’g, tÃ¢Â†Â’d, sÃ¢Â†Â’z, en hÃ¢Â†Â’b.

'n Klein weergawe van die hiragana vir ya, yu of yo (Ã£Â‚Âƒ, Ã£Â‚Â… of Ã£Â‚Â‡ onderskeidelik) kan by die hiragana wat met i eindig gevoeg word. Dit verander die i klinker om na 'n gly palatalisering te verander. Die byvoeging van die klein y kana word yÃ…?on genoem. 'n Klein tsu Ã£?Â£ genaamd sokuon dui 'n geminaat (dubbel) konsonant aan. Dit verskyn voor frikatiewe en stoppe, en soms aan die einde van sinne. Dit word voorgestel in rÃ…?maji deur die volgende konsonant te verdubbel. In informele teks word klein weergawes van die vyf klinker kana soms gebruik om die wegdofende klanke (Ã£?Â¯Ã£??, Ã£?Â­Ã£?Â‡) voor te stel.

The study was conducted in two phases: a comparative randomized phase, which served the primary objective of the study, and a follow-up phase. Study Phase 1, Day -14 to Week 12: patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of two groups: A. Truvada (substitution of their current NRTIs by Truvada [FTC/TDF] with continuation of their current NNRTI or PI at the same dose) B. Maintain Baseline Regimen (continuation of previous HAART regimen, i.e., maintained baseline regimen). This phase of the study served the primary objective of the study. Study Phase 2, roll-over follow-up, Week 12 to Week 48: Patients in the Truvada group continued with Truvada + an NNRTI or PI. Patients in the control group could switch their NRTIs to Truvada in this phase of the study (Delayed Truvada group). Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety during both phases of the study.

A number of salts of morphine are used, with the most common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, so it is not used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other, especially older, opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the","Biosynthesis[edit] The morphine is biosynthesized from the tetrahydroisoquinoline reticuline. It is converted into salutaridine, thebaine, and oripavine. The involucrated enzymes in this process are the salutaridine synthase, salutaridine:NADPH 7-oxidoreductase and the codeinone reductase.[68] Synthesis[edit] Main article: Morphine total synthesis The first morphine total synthesis, devised by Marshall D. Gates, Jr. in 1952, remains a widely used example of total synthesis.[69] Several other syntheses were reported, notably by the research groups of Rice,[70] Evans,[71] Fuchs,[72] Parker,[73] Overman,[74] Mulzer-Trauner,[75] White,[76] Taber,[77] Trost,[78] Fukuyama,[79] Guillou,[80] and Stork.[81] Production[edit]",True,0,0,"{24751=The primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy.[9] In 2013 an estimated 523,000 kilograms of morphine were produced.[10] About 45,000 kilograms were used directly for pain, an increase over the last twenty years of four times.[10] Most use for this purpose was in the developed world.[10] About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as hydromorphone, oxycodone, heroin, and methadone.[10][11][12] It is a Schedule II drug in the United States,[11] Class A in the United Kingdom,[13] and Schedule I in Canada.[14] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[15], 151368=In 2003, there was discovery of endogenous morphine occurring naturally in the human body. Thirty years of speculation were made on this subject because there was a receptor that, it appeared, reacted only to morphine: the ÃŽÂ¼3-opioid receptor in human tissue.[95] Human cells that form in reaction to cancerous neuroblastoma cells have been found to contain trace amounts of endogenous morphine.[96], 147925=Morphine became a controlled substance in the US under the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, and possession without a prescription in the US is a criminal offense. Morphine was the most commonly abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, there were no other drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol., 33416=Morphine is primarily used to treat both acute and chronic severe pain. It is also used for pain due to myocardial infarction and for labor pains.[16] However, concerns exist that morphine may increase mortality in the setting of non ST elevation myocardial infarction.[17] Morphine has also traditionally been used in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema.[16] A 2006 review, though, found little evidence to support this practice.[18], 144587=Diacetylmorphine (better known as heroin) was synthesized from morphine in 1874 and brought to market by Bayer in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight. Due to the lipid solubility of diacetylmorphine, it can cross the bloodÃ¢Â€Â“brain barrier faster than morphine, subsequently increasing the reinforcing component of addiction.[92] Using a variety of subjective and objective measures, one study estimated the relative potency of heroin to morphine administered intravenously to post-addicts to be 1.80Ã¢Â€Â“2.66Ã‚Â mg of morphine sulfate to 1Ã‚Â mg of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin).[33], 89151=A 1999 review estimated that relatively low doses of heroin (which metabolizes immediately into morphine) are detectable by standard urine tests for 1-1.5 days after use.[59] A 2009 review determined that, when the analyte is morphine and the limit of detection is 1Ã‚Â ng/ml, a 20Ã‚Â mg intravenous (IV) dose of morphine is detectable for 12Ã¢Â€Â“24 hours. A limit of detection of 0.6Ã‚Â ng/ml had similar results.[60], 142059=Morphine was discovered as the first active alkaloid extracted from the opium poppy plant in December 1804 in Paderborn, Germany, by Friedrich SertÃƒÂ¼rner.[6][87] The drug was first marketed to the general public by SertÃƒÂ¼rner and Company in 1817 as an analgesic, and also as a treatment for opium and alcohol addiction. Commercial production began in Darmstadt, Germany in 1827 by the pharmacy that became the pharmaceutical company Merck, with morphine sales being a large part of their early growth.[citation needed], 143285=Later it was found that morphine was more addictive than either alcohol or opium, and its extensive use during the American Civil War allegedly resulted in over 400,000[88] sufferers from the ""soldier's disease"" of morphine addiction.[89] This idea has been a subject of controversy, as there have been suggestions that such a disease was in fact a fabrication; the first documented use of the phrase ""soldier's disease"" was in 1915.[90][91], 131392=It was announced in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, codeine, and thebaine using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class cough suppressants (all of which can be made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or thebaine) was the initial reason for the research., 141013=An opium-based elixir has been ascribed to alchemists of Byzantine times, but the specific formula was lost during the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul).[86] Around 1522, Paracelsus made reference to an opium-based elixir that he called laudanum from the Latin word laudare, meaning ""to praise"" He described it as a potent painkiller, but recommended that it be used sparingly. In the late eighteenth century, when the East India Company gained a direct interest in the opium trade through India, another opiate recipe called laudanum became very popular among physicians and their patients., 150156=The structural formula of morphine was determined by 1925 by Robert Robinson. At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, the first of which was announced in 1952, by Dr. Marshall D. Gates, Jr. at the University of Rochester.[94] Still, the vast majority of morphine is derived from the opium poppy by either the traditional method of gathering latex from the scored, unripe pods of the poppy, or processes using poppy straw, the dried pods and stems of the plant, the most widespread of which was invented in Hungary in 1925 and announced in 1930 by the chemist JÃƒÂ¡nos Kabay., 122702=The first morphine total synthesis, devised by Marshall D. Gates, Jr. in 1952, remains a widely used example of total synthesis.[69] Several other syntheses were reported, notably by the research groups of Rice,[70] Evans,[71] Fuchs,[72] Parker,[73] Overman,[74] Mulzer-Trauner,[75] White,[76] Taber,[77] Trost,[78] Fukuyama,[79] Guillou,[80] and Stork.[81], 164644=Although morphine is cheap, people in poorer countries often do not have access to it. According to a 2005 estimate by the International Narcotics Control Board, six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) consume 79% of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s morphine. The less affluent countries, accounting for 80% of the world's population, consumed only about 6% of the global morphine supply. Some countries import virtually no morphine, and in others the drug is rarely available even for relieving severe pain while dying., 23115=Morphine was first isolated between 1803 and 1805 by Friedrich SertÃƒÂ¼rner.[5] This is generally believed to be the first isolation of an active ingredient from a plant.[6] Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827.[5] Morphine was more widely used after the invention of the hypodermic syringe in 1853Ã¢Â€Â“1855.[5][7] SertÃƒÂ¼rner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, for its tendency to cause sleep.[7][8]}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 19:15:24 GMT",

It also came less than a year after their son Joachim committed suicide. Remarriage With second wife, Hermine, and her daughter, Princess Henriette The following January, Wilhelm received a birthday greeting from a son of the late Prince Johann George Ludwig Ferdinand August Wilhelm of SchÃƒÂ¶naich-Carolath. The 63-year-old Wilhelm invited the boy and his mother, Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz, to Doorn. Wilhelm found Hermine very attractive, and greatly enjoyed her company. The couple were wed on 9 November 1922, despite the objections of Wilhelm's monarchist supporters and his children. Hermine's daughter, Princess Henriette, married the late Prince Joachim's son, Karl Franz Josef, in 1940, but divorced in 1946. Hermine remained a constant companion to the aging Emperor until his death. Ancestry Ancestors of Wilhelm II, German Emperor Ã‚Â ",True,0,0,"{83940=British public opinion had been quite favourable toward the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the War of 1914 to 1918, he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy.[40], 87644=In 1889 Wilhelm reorganised top level control of the navy by creating a Naval Cabinet (Marine-Kabinett) equivalent to the German Imperial Military Cabinet which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy. The Head of the Naval Cabinet was responsible for promotions, appointments, administration, and issuing orders to naval forces. Captain Gustav von Senden-Bibran was appointed as the first head and remained so until 1906. The existing Imperial admiralty was abolished, and its responsibilities divided between two organisations. A new position was created, equivalent to the supreme commander of the army: the Chief of the High Command of the Admiralty, or Oberkommando der Marine, was responsible for ship deployments, strategy and tactics. Vice-Admiral Max von der Goltz was appointed in 1889 and remained in post until 1895. Construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office (Reichsmarineamt), responsible to the Imperial Chancellor and advising the Reichstag on naval matters. The first appointee was Rear Admiral Karl Eduard Heusner, followed shortly by Rear Admiral Friedrich von Hollmann from 1890 to 1897. Each of these three heads of department reported separately to Wilhelm.[41], 100754=When it became clear that Germany would experience a war on two fronts and that Britain would enter the war if Germany attacked France through neutral Belgium, the panic-stricken Wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against Russia. When Helmuth von Moltke (the younger) (who had chosen the old plan from 19dÄ{{d‹ËIžiÀ›øA»Û˜€!5÷=+ všUø05, made by general von Schlieffen for the possibility of German war on two fronts) told him that this was impossible, Wilhelm said: ""Your uncle would have given me a different answer!""[45] Wilhelm is also reported to have said, ""To think that George and Nicky should have played me false! If my grandmother had been alive, she would never have allowed it.""[46] In the original Schlieffen plan, Germany would attack the (supposed) weaker enemy first, meaning France. The plan supposed that it would take a long time before Russia was ready for war. Defeating France had been easy for Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At the 1914 border between France and Germany, an attack at this more southern part of France could be stopped by the French fortress along the border. However, Wilhelm II stopped any invasion of the Netherlands., 72329=A domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter Victoria Louise married the Duke of Brunswick in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern which followed the annexation of Hanover by Prussia in 1866.[30], 69502=German foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse. He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. It is now widely recognised that the various spectacular acts which Wilhelm undertook in the international sphere were often partially encouraged by the German foreign policy elite. There were a number of notorious examples, such as the Kruger telegram of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal Republic on the suppression of the British Jameson Raid, thus alienating British public opinion., 135569=On 8 June 1913, a year before the Great War began, The New York Times published a special supplement devoted to the 25th anniversary of the Kaiser's coronation.

RÃƒÂ¶hl has portrayed Wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of Imperial Germany.[77] Thus, the argument is made that the Kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in Germany's relations with Britain before 1914.[78][79], 9900=Wilhelm II or William II (German: Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albrecht von PreuÃƒÂŸen; Frederick William Victor Albert of Prussia; 27 January 1859Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandson of the British Queen Victoria and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe., 130361=Wilhelm in 1933, 105232=Wilhelm's role in wartime was of ever-decreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties. The high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the Schlieffen plan had failed. By 1916 the Empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff.[47] Increasingly cut off from reality and the political decision-making process, Wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory, depending upon the fortunes of his armies. Nevertheless, Wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment, and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be effected. Wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger in September 1914 and his replacement by Erich von Falkenhayn. In 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided that Bethman-Hollweg was no longer acceptable to them as Chancellor and called upon the Kaiser to appoint somebody else. When asked whom they would accept, Ludendorff recommended Georg Michaelis, a nonentity he barely knew. The Kaiser did not know Michaelis, but accepted the suggestion. Upon hearing in July 1917 that his cousin George V had changed the name of the British royal house to Windsor,[48] Wilhelm remarked that he planned to see Shakespeare's play The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.[49] The Kaiser's support collapsed completely in OctoberÃ¢Â€Â“November 1918 in the army, in the civilian government, and in German public opinion, as President Woodrow Wilson made clear the Kaiser could no longer be a party to peace negotiations.[50][51] That year also saw Wilhelm sickened during the worldwide 1918 flu pandemic, though he survived.[52], 134851=Three trends have characterized the writing about Wilhelm. First, the court-inspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero, often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the Kaiser's own memoirs. Second, there came those who judged Wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position, a ruler too reckless to deal with power. Third, after 1950, later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early 20th century and attempted an objective portrayal of Wilhelm and his rule.[75], 144224=Empress Augusta, known affectionately as ""Dona"", was a constant companion to Wilhelm, and her death on 11 April 1921 was a devastating blow. It also came less than a year after their son Joachim committed suicide., 62407=In 1913, Wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in Berlin for his only daughter, Victoria Louise. Among the guests at the wedding were Tsar Nicholas II, who also disliked Wilhelm, and his English cousin, King George V and his wife, Queen Mary., 35373=Early conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men. Bismarck believed that Wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated, and he showed scant respect for Wilhelm's policies in the late 1880s. The final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon after an attempt by Bismarck to implement a far-reaching anti-Socialist law in early 1890., 124863=During his last year at Doorn, Wilhelm believed that Germany was the land of monarchy and therefore of Christ, and that England was the land of liberalism and therefore of Satan and the Anti-Christ. He argued that the English ruling classes were ""Freemasons thoroughly infected by Juda"". Wilhelm asserted that the ""British people must be liberated from Antichrist Juda. We must drive Juda out of England just as he has been chased out of the Continent.""[70][clarification needed] He believed the Freemasons and Jews had caused the two world wars, aiming at a world Jewish empire with British and American gold, but that ""Juda's plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the European Continent!"" Continental Europe was now, Wilhelm wrote, ""consolidating and closing itself off from British influences after the elimination of the British and the Jews!"" The end result would be a ""U.S. of Europe!""[70] In a letter of 1940 to his sister Princess Margaret, Wilhelm wrote: ""The hand of God is creating a new world & working miracles... We are becoming the U.S. of Europe under German leadership, a united European Continent."" He added: ""The Jews [are] being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries, whom they have driven to hostility for centuries.""[66] Also in 1940 came what would have been his mother's 100th birthday, on which he wrote ironically to a friend ""Today the 100th birthday of my mother! No notice is taken of it at home! No 'Memorial Service' or... committee to remember her marvellous work for the... welfare of our German people... Nobody of the new generation knows anything about her.""[71] This sympathy for his mother is in sharp contrast to the intense animosity he expressed for her during most of her life.[citation needed], 109590=Wilhelm was at the Imperial Army headquarters in Spa, Belgium, when the uprisings in Berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late 1918. Mutiny among the ranks of his beloved Kaiserliche Marine, the imperial navy, profoundly shocked him. After the outbreak of the German Revolution, Wilhelm could not make up his mind whether or not to abdicate. Up to that point, he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown, but still hoped to retain the Prussian kingship. However, this was impossible under the imperial constitution. While Wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with Prussia, the constitution actually tied the imperial crown to the Prussian crown, meaning that Wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other., 86671=The new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as the ""Risk Theory"" or the Tirpitz Plan, by which Germany could force Britain to accede to German demands in the international arena through the threat posed by a powerful battlefleet concentrated in the North Sea. Tirpitz enjoyed Wilhelm's full support in his advocacy of successive naval bills of 1897 and 1900, by which the German navy was built up to contend with that of the British Empire. Naval expansion under the Fleet Acts eventually led to severe financial strains in Germany by 1914, as by 1906 Wilhelm had committed his navy to construction of the much larger, more expensive dreadnought type of battleship., 113841=The fact that the High Command might one day abandon the Kaiser had been foreseen in December 1897, when Wilhelm had visited Otto von Bismarck for the last time. Bismarck had again warned the Kaiser about the increasing influence of militarists, especially of the admirals who were pushing for the construction of a battle fleet. Bismarck's last warning had been:, 122456=In the wake of the German victory over Poland in September 1939, Wilhelm's adjutant, General von Dommes, wrote on his behalf to Hitler, stating that the House of Hohenzollern ""remained loyal"" and noted that nine Prussian Princes (one son and eight grandchildren) were stationed at the front, concluding ""because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country, His Majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment. The Emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication.""[66] Wilhelm greatly admired the success which Hitler was able to achieve in the opening months of the Second World War, and personally sent a congratulatory telegram when the Netherlands surrendered in May 1940: ""My Fuhrer, I congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the German monarchy will be restored completely."" Hitler was reportedly exasperated and bemused, and remarked to Linge, his valet, ""What an idiot!"".[67] In another telegram to Hitler upon the fall of Paris a month later, Wilhelm stated ""Congratulations, you have won using my troops."" In a letter to his daughter Victoria Louise, Duchess of Brunswick, he wrote triumphantly, ""Thus is the pernicious Entente Cordiale of Uncle Edward VII brought to nought.""[68] Nevertheless, after the Nazi conquest of the Netherlands in 1940, the aging Wilhelm retired completely from public life. In May 1940, when Hitler invaded the Netherlands, Wilhelm declined an offer from Churchill of asylum in Britain, preferring to die at Huis Doorn.[69], 146029=The following January, Wilhelm received a birthday greeting from a son of the late Prince Johann George Ludwig Ferdinand August Wilhelm of SchÃƒÂ¶naich-Carolath. The 63-year-old Wilhelm invited the boy and his mother, Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz, to Doorn. Wilhelm found Hermine very attractive, and greatly enjoyed her company. The couple were wed on 9 November 1922, despite the objections of Wilhelm's monarchist supporters and his children. Hermine's daughter, Princess Henriette, married the late Prince Joachim's son, Karl Franz Josef, in 1940, but divorced in 1946. Hermine remained a constant companion to the aging Emperor until his death., 73195=The German East Africa Company colonized the East African coast around Tanganyika but the Arabs under Abushiri ibn Salim al-Harthi started a massive revolt along the coast, killing German representatives of the company and seizing control. The German Empire sent troops to crush the uprising, with the help of a British blockade. The uprising was defeated by 1889 and the Arab rebel leader Abushiri was hanged by German forces., 76652=A great task awaits you: you are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done. The Chinese have overturned the law of nations; they have mocked the sacredness of the envoy, the duties of hospitality in a way unheard of in world history. It is all the more outrageous that this crime has been committed by a nation that takes pride in its ancient culture. Show the old Prussian virtue. Present yourselves as Christians in the cheerful endurance of suffering. May honor and glory follow your banners and arms. Give the whole world an example of manliness and discipline., 18267=Wilhelm was born on 27 January 1859 at the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin to Prince Frederick William of Prussia (the future Frederick III) and his wife, Victoria, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of Britain's Queen Victoria. At the time of his birth, his great-uncle Frederick William IV was king of Prussia, and his grandfather and namesake Wilhelm was acting as Regent. He was the first grandchild of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, but more importantly, as the first son of the Crown Prince of Prussia, Wilhelm was from 1861 second in the line of succession to Prussia, and also, after 1871, to the newly created German Empire, which, according to the constitution of the German Empire, was ruled by the Prussian King., 71685=One of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900 he supported the marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Sophie Chotek, against the wishes of Emperor Franz Joseph.[29], 118474=In 1922, Wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs[61]Ã¢Â€Â”a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the Great War, and defended his conduct throughout his reign, especially in matters of foreign policy. For the remaining twenty years of his life, he entertained guests (often of some standing) and kept himself updated on events in Europe. He grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop. He also learned the Dutch language. Wilhelm developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the Corfu Achilleion, excavating at the site of the Temple of Artemis in Corfu, a passion he retained in his exile. He had bought the former Greek residence of Empress Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. He also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored. In exile, one of Wilhelm's greatest passions was hunting, and he bagged thousands of animals, both beast and bird. Much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at Doorn.[62], 42900=Bismarck resigned at Wilhelm II's insistence in 1890, at the age of 75, to be succeeded as Chancellor of Germany and Minister-President of Prussia by Leo von Caprivi, who in turn was replaced by Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-SchillingsfÃƒÂ¼rst, in 1894. Following the dismissal of Hohenlohe in 1900, Wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as ""his own Bismarck"", Bernhard von BÃƒÂ¼low., 77242=You know full well that you are to fight against a cunning, brave, well-armed, and cruel enemy. When you encounter him, know this: no quarter will be given. Prisoners will not be taken. Exercise your arms such that for a thousand years no Chinese will dare to look cross-eyed at a German. Maintain discipline. May GodÃ¢Â€Â™s blessing be with you, the prayers of an entire nation and my good wishes go with you, each and every one. Open the way to civilization once and for all! Now you may depart! Farewell, comrades![32][33], 85231=Nothing Wilhelm did in the international arena was of more influence than his decision to pursue a policy of massive naval construction. A powerful navy was Wilhelm's pet project. He had inherited from his mother a love of the British Royal Navy, which was at that time the world's largest. He once confided to his uncle, the Prince of Wales, that his dream was to have a ""fleet of my own some day"". Wilhelm's frustration over his fleet's poor showing at the Fleet Review at his grandmother Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, combined with his inability to exert German influence in South Africa following the dispatch of the Kruger telegram, led to Wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his British cousins. Wilhelm was fortunate to be able to call on the services of the dynamic naval officer Alfred von Tirpitz, whom he appointed to the head of the Imperial Naval Office in 1897., 129234=The Huis Doorn in 1925, 37805=As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it., 43581=In foreign policy Bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between Germany, France and RussiaÃ¢Â€Â”peace was at hand and Bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against Britain (regarding colonies) and especially against Russia. With Bismarck's dismissal the Russians now expected a reversal of policy in Berlin, so they quickly came to terms with France, beginning the process that by 1914 largely isolated Germany.[12], 62970=Wilhelm's biographer Lamar Cecil identified Wilhelm's ""curious but well-developed anti-Semitism"", noting that in 1888 a friend of Wilhelm ""declared that the young Kaiser's dislike of his Hebrew subjects, one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in Germany, was so strong that it could not be overcome."" Cecil concludes:, 99182=On the night of 30 July, when handed a document stating that Russia would not cancel its mobilization, Wilhelm wrote a lengthy commentary containing these observations:, 40596=Although Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889Ã¢Â€Â“90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer.[11] In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations., 79341=One of Wilhelm's diplomatic blunders sparked the Moroccan Crisis of 1905, when he made a spectacular visit to Tangier, in Morocco. His presence was seen as an assertion of German interests in Morocco, in opposition to those of France. In his speech, he even made remarks in favour of Moroccan independence, and this led to friction with France, which had expanding colonial interests in Morocco, and to the Algeciras Conference, which served largely to further isolate Germany in Europe.[35], 138807=Wilhelm and his first wife, Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, were married on 27 February 1881. They had seven children:, 132133=Wilhelm died of a pulmonary embolus in Doorn, Netherlands, on 3 June 1941, aged 82, just weeks before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. German soldiers had been guarding his house. Hitler, however, was reported to be angry that the former monarch had an honor guard of German troops and nearly fired the general who ordered them when he found out. Despite his personal animosity toward Wilhelm, Hitler wanted to bring his body back to Berlin for a state funeral, as Wilhelm was a symbol of Germany and Germans during the previous World War. Hitler felt that such a funeral would demonstrate to the Germans the direct descent of the Third Reich from the old German Empire.[72] However, Wilhelm's wishes never to return to Germany until the restoration of the monarchy were respected, and the Nazi occupation authorities granted him a small military funeral, with a few hundred people present. The mourners included August von Mackensen, fully dressed in his old imperial Life Hussars uniform, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and Reichskommissar for the Netherlands Arthur Seyss-Inquart, along with a few other military advisers. However, Wilhelm's request that the swastika and other Nazi regalia be not displayed at his funeral was ignored, and they are featured in the photographs of the event taken by a Dutch photographer.[73], 32472=Beginning in 1884, Bismarck began advocating that Kaiser Wilhelm send his grandson on various diplomatic missions, a privilege denied to the Crown Prince. That year, Prince Wilhelm was sent to the court of Tsar Alexander III in St. Petersburg to attend the coming of age ceremony of the sixteen-year-old Tsarevich Nicholas. However Wilhelm's behavior did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar. Two years later, Kaiser Wilhelm I took Prince Wilhelm on a trip to meet with the Austro-Hungarian emperor, Franz Joseph. In 1886, also, thanks to Herbert von Bismarck, the son of the Chancellor, Prince Wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the Foreign Ministry. One privilege was denied to Prince Wilhelm: to represent Germany at his maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria's, Golden Jubilee Celebrations in London in 1887.[citation needed], 34076=The German Emperor Wilhelm I died in Berlin on 9 March 1888, and Prince Wilhelm's father was proclaimed Emperor as Frederick III. He was already suffering from an incurable throat cancer and spent all 99 days of his reign fighting the disease before dying. On 15 June of that same year, his 29-year-old son succeeded him as German Emperor and King of Prussia., 116824=Wilhelm first settled in Amerongen, where on 28 November he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the Prussian and imperial thrones, thus formally ending the Hohenzollerns' 400-year rule over Prussia. Accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good, he gave up his rights to ""the throne of Prussia and to the German Imperial throne connected therewith."" He also released his soldiers and officials in both Prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him.[58] He purchased a country house in the municipality of Doorn, known as Huis Doorn and moved in on 15 May 1920.[59] This was to be his home for the remainder of his life. The Weimar Republic allowed Wilhelm to remove twenty-three railway wagons of furniture, twenty-seven containing packages of all sorts, one bearing a car and another a boat, from the New Palace at Potsdam.[60], 115309=On 10 November, Wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the Netherlands, which had remained neutral throughout the war.[56] Upon the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles in early 1919, Article 227 expressly provided for the prosecution of Wilhelm ""for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties"", but Queen Wilhelmina and the Dutch government refused to extradite him, despite appeals from the Allies. King George V wrote that he looked on his cousin as ""the greatest criminal in history"", but opposed Prime Minister David Lloyd George's proposal to ""hang the Kaiser"". President Woodrow Wilson of the United States rejected extradition, arguing that punishing Wilhelm for waging war would destabilize international order and lose the peace.[57], 50334=Wilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the Prussian system of secondary education, which was rigidly traditional, elitist, politically authoritarian, and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences. As hereditary Protector of the Order of Saint John, he offered encouragement to the Christian order's attempts to place German medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals, nursing sisterhood and nursing schools, and nursing homes throughout the German Empire. Wilhelm continued as Protector of the Order even after 1918, as the position was in essence attached to the head of the House of Hohenzollern.[14][15], 30176=In many ways, Wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of Otto von Bismarck's machinations. Both sides of his family had suffered from mental illness, and this may explain his emotional instability.[citation needed] When Wilhelm was in his early twenties, Bismarck tried to separate him from his parents (who opposed Bismarck and his policies) with some success. Bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance. Wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents, but especially with his English mother. In an outburst in April 1889, Wilhelm angrily implied that ""an English doctor killed my father, and an English doctor crippled my arm Ã¢Â€Â“ which is the fault of my mother"", who allowed no German physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family.[8], 110755=Wilhelm's hopes of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when, in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest, Chancellor Prince Max of Baden announced Wilhelm's abdication of both titles on 9 November 1918. Prince Max himself was forced to resign later the same day, when it became clear that only Friedrich Ebert, leader of the SPD, could effectively exert control. Later that day, one of Ebert's secretaries of state (ministers), Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann, proclaimed Germany a republic., 74003=The Boxer rebellion, an anti-western uprising in China, was put down in 1900 by an international force of British, French, Russian, American, Japanese, and German troops. The Germans, however, forfeited any prestige they might have gained for their participation by arriving only after the British and Japanese forces had taken Peking, the site of the fiercest fighting. Moreover, the poor impression left by the German troops' late arrival was made worse by the Kaiser's ill-conceived farewell address, in which he commanded them, in the spirit of the Huns, to be merciless in battle.[31] Wilhelm delivered this speech in Bremerhaven on 27 July 1900, addressing German troops who were departing to suppress the Boxer rebellion in China. The speech was infused with Wilhelm's fiery and chauvinistic rhetoric and clearly expressed his vision of German imperial power. There were two versions of the speech. The Foreign Office issued an edited version, making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing.[32] The edited version read like this:, 60077=Wilhelm's most contentious relationships were with his British relations. He craved the acceptance of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, and of the rest of her family.[20] Despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact, his other relatives found him arrogant and obnoxious, and they largely denied him acceptance.[21] He had an especially bad relationship with his Uncle Bertie, the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. Between 1888 and 1901, Wilhelm resented his Uncle, a mere heir to the throne, treating him not as emperor of Germany, but merely as another nephew.[22] In turn, Wilhelm often snubbed his uncle, whom he referred to as ""the old peacock"" and lorded his position as emperor over him.[23] Beginning in the 1890s, Wilhelm made visits to England for Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races. Edward's wife, the Danish-born Alexandra, first as Princess of Wales and later as Queen, also disliked Wilhelm, never forgetting the Prussian seizure of Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark in the 1860s, as well as being annoyed over Wilhelm's treatment of his mother.[24] Despite his poor relations with his English relatives, nevertheless, when he received news that Queen Victoria was dying at Osborne House in January 1901, Wilhelm traveled to England and was at her bedside when she died and remained for the funeral. He also was present at the funeral of King Edward VII in 1910., 31516=As a young man, Wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt. She, however, turned him down, and would, in time, marry into the Russian imperial family. In 1880, however, Wilhelm became engaged to Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, known as ""Dona"". The couple married on 27 February 1881, and would remain married for forty years, until her death in 1921. In a period of ten years, between 1882 and 1892, Augusta Victoria would bear Wilhelm seven children, six sons and a daughter.[9], 89767=In addition to the expansion of the fleet the Kiel Canal was opened in 1895 enabling faster movements between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea., 92207=Wilhelm was a friend of Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, and he was deeply shocked by his assassination on 28 June 1914. Wilhelm offered to support Austria-Hungary in crushing the Black Hand, the secret organization that had plotted the killing, and even sanctioned the use of force by Austria against the perceived source of the movementÃ¢Â€Â”Serbia (this is often called ""the blank cheque""). He wanted to remain in Berlin until the crisis was resolved, but his courtiers persuaded him instead to go on his annual cruise of the North Sea on 6 July 1914. Wilhelm made erratic attempts to stay on top of the crisis via telegram, and when the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum was delivered to Serbia, he hurried back to Berlin. He reached Berlin on 28 July, read a copy of the Serbian reply, and wrote on it:, 49390=Wilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences, as well as public education and social welfare. He sponsored the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the promotion of scientific research; it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences. The Prussian Academy of Sciences was unable to avoid the Kaiser's pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering, and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the Kaiser in 1900.[13], 111705=Wilhelm consented to the abdication only after Ludendorff's replacement, General Wilhelm Groener, had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under Paul von Hindenburg's command, but would certainly not fight for Wilhelm's throne on the home front. The monarchy's last and strongest support had been broken, and finally even Hindenburg, himself a lifelong royalist, was obliged, with some embarrassment, to advise the Emperor to give up the crown.[53], 56735=As a grandchild of Queen Victoria, Wilhelm was a first cousin of the British Empire's King George V, as well as of Queens Marie of Romania, Maud of Norway, and Victoria Eugenie of Spain, and of the Empress Alexandra of Russia. In 1889, Wilhelm's younger sister, Sophia, married the future King Constantine I of Greece. Wilhelm, infuriated by his sister's conversion to Greek Orthodoxy upon her marriage, attempted to ban her from entering Germany., 81528=Perhaps Wilhelm's most damaging personal blunder cost him much of his prestige and power and had a far greater impact in Germany than overseas. The Daily Telegraph Affair of 1908 involved the publication in Germany of an interview with a British daily newspaper that included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks. Wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on Anglo-German friendship, but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview, he ended up further alienating not only the British, but also the French, Russians, and Japanese. He implied, among other things, that the Germans cared nothing for the British; that the French and Russians had attempted to incite Germany to intervene in the Second Boer War; and that the German naval buildup was targeted against the Japanese, not Britain. One memorable quotation from the interview was ""You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares.""[36] The effect in Germany was quite significant, with serious calls for his abdication. Wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the Daily Telegraph fiasco, but later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the chancellor, Prince BÃƒÂ¼low, who had abandoned the Emperor to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its German publication. [37][38] The Daily Telegraph crisis deeply wounded Wilhelm's previously unimpaired self-confidence, and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered. He lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic and foreign policy.[39], 10754=Crowned in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890 and launched Germany on a bellicose ""New Course"" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. Bombastic and impetuous, he sometimes made tactless pronouncements on sensitive topics without consulting his ministers, culminating in a disastrous Daily Telegraph interview that cost him most of his influence in 1908. His top generals, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, dictated policy during the First World War with little regard for the civilian government. An ineffective war leader, he lost the support of the army, abdicated in November 1918, and fled to exile in the Netherlands., 21345=In 1863 Wilhelm was taken to England to be present at the wedding of his Uncle Bertie, (later King Edward VII), and Princess Alexandra of Denmark. William attended the ceremony in a Highland costume, complete with a small toy dirk. During the ceremony the four-year-old became restless. His eighteen-year-old uncle Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, charged with keeping an eye on him, told him to be quiet, but Wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened Alfred. When Alfred attempted to subdue him by force, Wilhelm bit him on the leg. His grandmother, Queen Victoria, missed seeing the fracas; to her Wilhelm remained ""a clever, dear, good little child, the great favorite of my beloved Vicky"".[2], 120081=In the early 1930s, Wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the German Nazi Party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the monarchy, with his eldest grandson as the fourth Kaiser. His second wife, Hermine, actively petitioned the Nazi government on her husband's behalf. However, Adolf Hitler, himself a veteran of the First World War, like other leading Nazis, felt nothing but scorn for the man they blamed for Germany's greatest defeat, and the petitions were ignored. Though he played host to Hermann GÃƒÂ¶ring at Doorn on at least one occasion, Wilhelm grew to distrust Hitler. Hearing of the murder of the wife of former Chancellor Schleicher, he said ""We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!""[63] Wilhelm was also appalled at the Kristallnacht of 9Ã¢Â€Â“10 November 1938, saying ""I have just made my views clear to Auwi [Wilhelm's fourth son] in the presence of his brothers. He had the nerve to say that he agreed with the Jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about. When I told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms, he appeared totally indifferent. He is completely lost to our family"".[64] He also stated, ""For the first time, I am ashamed to be a German.""[65], 64033=On 2 December 1919, Wilhelm wrote to Field Marshal August von Mackensen, denouncing his own abdication as the ""deepest, most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history, the Germans have done to themselves... egged on and misled by the tribe of JudahÃ‚Â ... Let no German ever forget this, nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from German soil!""[26] Wilhelm advocated a ""regular international all-worlds pogrom ÃƒÂ  la Russe"" as ""the best cure"" and further believed that Jews were a ""nuisance that humanity must get rid of some way or other.

La FW23 apparaÃƒÂ®t comme trÃƒÂ¨s performante, remportant ÃƒÂ  Imola la premiÃƒÂ¨re victoire de l'ÃƒÂ©quipe depuis 1997, suivie de trois autres ÃƒÂ  MontrÃƒÂ©al, Hockenheim et Monza. L'ÃƒÂ©quipe est ÃƒÂ  nouveau troisiÃƒÂ¨me du championnat., 39808=En 1998, les dÃƒÂ©parts de Renault Sport et d'Adrian Newey ne permettent pas ÃƒÂ  Williams et Jacques Villeneuve de conserver leurs titres. Le moteur Mecachrome (ex-Renault) n'est pas assez performant et Newey a manquÃƒÂ© pour le dÃƒÂ©veloppement de la FW20 alors qu'il dessinait la voiture championne du monde, la McLaren MP4/13. L'ÃƒÂ©quipe signe trois podiums ÃƒÂ  Melbourne, Hockenheim et Budapest et doit lutter jusqu'au bout pour la troisiÃƒÂ¨me place du championnat., 22300=Toujours aussi dÃƒÂ©sargentÃƒÂ©, Williams accepte fin 1975 la prise de participation majoritaire dans l'ÃƒÂ©curie du milliardaire austro-canadien Walter Wolf. En 1976, l'ÃƒÂ©quipe devient donc Wolf-Williams et aligne les voitures de l'ancienne ÃƒÂ©curie de Lord Hesketh. Mais au bout d'une seule saison, Walter Wolf pousse Frank Williams dehors et rachÃƒÂ¨te la totalitÃƒÂ© de l'ÃƒÂ©curie, qui devient Walter Wolf Racing en 1977., 34968=En 1992, Williams dÃƒÂ©croche 10 victoires, 14 pole positions et un doublÃƒÂ© au championnat des pilotes. La FW14B bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ficie au maximum des aides ÃƒÂ©lectroniques trÃƒÂ¨s dÃƒÂ©veloppÃƒÂ©es. NÃƒÂ©anmoins, le champion du monde, Mansell, quitte Williams et la Formule 1 pour le championnat CART., 36775=En 1995, Hill fait ÃƒÂ©quipe avec David Coulthard prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Mansell. Face ÃƒÂ  Schumacher et Benetton-Renault, l'Anglais est impuissant et commet de nombreuses erreurs. Williams ne remporte que cinq victoires et finit second au championnat.En 1996, Williams conserve Damon Hill qui fait ÃƒÂ©quipe avec le novice Jacques Villeneuve. La FW18 est trÃƒÂ¨s performante et Hill devient champion du monde avec huit victoires. Hill dÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ§oit en fin de saison, se laissant rattraper par Villeneuve et quitte l'ÃƒÂ©curie en 1997, oÃƒÂ¹ il est remplacÃƒÂ© par Heinz-Harald Frentzen., 12720=Frank Williams a commencÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  faire courir des voitures en Formule 1 au cours de la saison 1969. L'ÃƒÂ©curie a fait ses dÃƒÂ©buts dans le championnat du monde des constructeurs, sous son nom propre, en 1975 avant d'ÃƒÂªtre rachetÃƒÂ©e fin 1976. L'ÃƒÂ©quipe Williams telle qu'elle existe aujourd'hui n'a vu le jour qu'en 1977 et a dÃƒÂ©butÃƒÂ© en 1978. Avec ses 16 titres mondiaux acquis lors des annÃƒÂ©es 1980 et 1990, elle est l'une des plus prestigieuses ÃƒÂ©curies de l'histoire de la Formule 1., 20023=La premiÃƒÂ¨re ÃƒÂ©curie Williams a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© fondÃƒÂ©e en 1966 sous le nom Frank Williams Racing Cars Ltd. ÃƒÂ€ cette ÃƒÂ©poque, Frank Williams prÃƒÂ©pare et engage des chÃƒÂ¢ssis Brabham en Formule 3 et en Formule 2. Puis, ÃƒÂ  partir de 1969, Williams engage des voitures en Formule 1Ã‚Â : une Brabham BT26A en 1969, une De Tomaso 505 en 1970, deux March en 1971 et 1972 ainsi qu'une Politoys FX3 en 1972., 45659=Le dÃƒÂ©but de saison 2003 est ÃƒÂ©galement dÃƒÂ©cevant en raison de problÃƒÂ¨mes aÃƒÂ©rodynamiques. Ceux-ci rÃƒÂ©glÃƒÂ©s, les Williams deviennent trÃƒÂ¨s performantes ÃƒÂ  partir de l'Autriche avec une sÃƒÂ©rie de quatre victoires ÃƒÂ  Monaco, au Nurburgring, ÃƒÂ  Magny-Cours et Hockenheim. Quelques erreurs coÃƒÂ»tent les deux titres ÃƒÂ  Williams. Fin 2003, Montoya annonce son transfert chez McLaren pour 2005., 35373=En 1993, Alain Prost remplace Mansell et le pilote essayeur Damon Hill remplace Patrese. MalgrÃƒÂ© des dÃƒÂ©buts difficiles sous la pluie d'Interlagos et Donington, Prost remporte son quatriÃƒÂ¨me titre et Hill finit troisiÃƒÂ¨me avec trois victoires. En 1994, Prost, qui a pris sa retraite, est remplacÃƒÂ© par Ayrton Senna. Les aides au pilotage ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© supprimÃƒÂ©es, ce qui rend trÃƒÂ¨s instable la FW16. Senna ne marque aucun point lors des deux premiÃƒÂ¨res courses. Survient alors le drame d'Imola, oÃƒÂ¹ Senna meurt dans un accident alors qu'il ÃƒÂ©tait en tÃƒÂªte du Grand Prix. Hill est propulsÃƒÂ© leader de l'ÃƒÂ©curie face ÃƒÂ  Michael Schumacher mais il ne peut rien face ÃƒÂ  l'Allemand malgrÃƒÂ© l'aide de David Coulthard et Nigel Mansell qui revient pour cinq Grands Prix et qui contribuent au sacre constructeur de Williams avec sept victoires., 59859=En 2011, Williams perd plusieurs sponsors majeurs et, pour assurer l'avenir de l'ÃƒÂ©curie, une partie de son capital est mis en bourse[4], et le pilote payant vÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©zuÃƒÂ©lien Pastor Maldonado (champion GP2 2010) remplace Nico HÃƒÂ¼lkenberg. Le manque de budget se fait ressentir sur les performances, la FW33 manque de fiabilitÃƒÂ© et de vitesse, seuls cinq points sont inscrits, installant l'ÃƒÂ©curie ÃƒÂ  la neuviÃƒÂ¨me place du championnat, son pire classement depuis 1978[5]., 24263=En 1977, par manque de temps, la nouvelle ÃƒÂ©quipe Williams ne peut faire autre chose que d'engager une March 761 de la saison prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dente, motorisÃƒÂ©e par un Ford-Cosworth DFV. Mais dÃƒÂ¨s 1978, l'ÃƒÂ©quipe retrouve son statut de constructeur, avec toujours le mÃƒÂªme motoriste. Clay Regazzoni signe la premiÃƒÂ¨re victoire de l'ÃƒÂ©curie au Grand Prix de Grande-Bretagne 1979, 54527=AprÃƒÂ¨s une saison 2007 encourageante, Kazuki Nakajima, jeune espoir de Toyota, remplace Alexander Wurz en 2008 au volant d'une FW30 prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©e discrÃƒÂ¨tement mais sur laquelle l'ÃƒÂ©quipe fonde de grands espoirs. La saison dÃƒÂ©bute bien puisque Nico Rosberg monte sur son premier podium grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  sa troisiÃƒÂ¨me place et que Kazuki Nakajima finit sixiÃƒÂ¨me en Australie. Au Grand Prix de Singapour, Kazuki Nakajima se classe huitiÃƒÂ¨me tandis que Nico Rosberg monte sur la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me marche du podium derriÃƒÂ¨re Fernando Alonso et devant Lewis Hamilton. Mais ces deux bons rÃƒÂ©sultats sont les seuls coups d'ÃƒÂ©clats de l'annÃƒÂ©e et l'ÃƒÂ©curie termine huitiÃƒÂ¨me du championnat., 60892=Le directeur technique, Sam Michael, en place depuis 2004, est dÃƒÂ©barquÃƒÂ© au profit de Mike Coughlan[6]. Williams et Renault Sport F1 annoncent un partenariat chÃƒÂ¢ssis-moteur de longue durÃƒÂ©e, le dÃƒÂ©partement F1 de Renault ÃƒÂ©quipant Williams de ses blocs moteurs V8 pour les saisons 2012 et 2013. Outre la fourniture de moteurs, le partenariat comprend d'autres opportunitÃƒÂ©s commerciales et marketing, avec une possibilitÃƒÂ© de prolongation aprÃƒÂ¨s l'introduction du futur moteur V6 turbo en 2014[7],[8]., 55820=En 2009, Williams fournit les chÃƒÂ¢ssis de la nouvelle Formule 2 et profite de la nouvelle rÃƒÂ¨glementation (pneus slicks, SREC, aÃƒÂ©rodynamique modifiÃƒÂ©e, rÃƒÂ©duction des coÃƒÂ»ts) pour se relancer grÃƒÂ¢ce au double diffuseur qui lui offre un avantage en dÃƒÂ©but de saison, tout comme Brawn GP et Toyota. Mais au fur et ÃƒÂ  mesure de la saison, l'ÃƒÂ©quipe rentre dans le rang et doit se contenter de la septiÃƒÂ¨me place du classement des constructeurs grÃƒÂ¢ce principalement ÃƒÂ  Nico Rosberg qui marque tous les points de l'ÃƒÂ©quipe., 27724=Alan Jones remporte le championnat en 1980, imitÃƒÂ© par Keke Rosberg en 1982. En 1980 et 1981, l'ÃƒÂ©curie dÃƒÂ©croche ÃƒÂ©galement le titre des constructeurs., 23243=DÃƒÂ©but 1977, Frank Williams fonde une nouvelle ÃƒÂ©curie en association avec le jeune ingÃƒÂ©nieur Patrick Head. C'est cette nouvelle structure, baptisÃƒÂ©e Williams Grand Prix Engineering, qui perdure de nos jours et communique sous le nom Williams F1 Team., 21376=Devant la mÃƒÂ©diocritÃƒÂ© des rÃƒÂ©sultats accumulÃƒÂ©s depuis 1969, Frank Williams dÃƒÂ©cide courant 1972 de changer de stratÃƒÂ©gie et devient constructeur ÃƒÂ  part entiÃƒÂ¨re. C'est ainsi que nait en 1972 la Polytoys FX3, baptisÃƒÂ©e du nom d'un fabricant de jouets partenaire de l'opÃƒÂ©ration. Elle deviendra Iso-Marlboro FX3 en 1973, suite ÃƒÂ  un partenariat avec le fabricant de voitures de sport italien Iso Rivolta. En 1975, le partenariat se termine, et les chÃƒÂ¢ssis sont, pour la premiÃƒÂ¨re fois, baptisÃƒÂ©s Williams., 11875=Williams Grand Prix Engineering est une ÃƒÂ©curie britannique de Formule 1, basÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  Grove. FondÃƒÂ©e en 1977 par Frank Williams et Patrick Head, l'ÃƒÂ©quipe est actuellement la propriÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© de Frank Williams (63Ã‚Â %), Patrick Head (27Ã‚Â %) et Toto Wolff (10Ã‚Â %)., 46142=En 2004, Williams prÃƒÂ©sente un aileron avant rÃƒÂ©volutionnaire. Mais tandis que Ferrari reprend sa domination, Williams ne parvient pas ÃƒÂ  lutter avec British American Racing et Renault F1 Team pour la seconde place du championnat. ÃƒÂ€ Indianapolis, Ralf Schumacher est victime d'un grave accidentÃ‚Â : il est remplacÃƒÂ© par Marc GenÃƒÂ© puis AntÃƒÂ´nio Pizzonia. En fin de saison, un aileron plus classique est de retour et Montoya remporte son dernier Grand Prix pour Williams au BrÃƒÂ©sil. Williams finit quatriÃƒÂ¨me du championnat du monde., 30228=En 1987 en revanche, Mansell et Piquet n'ont pas de rivaux, mais c'est en interne que leur duel va s'avÃƒÂ©rer le plus intense. Piquet va faire un pied de nez ÃƒÂ  Frank Williams, souffler le titre ÃƒÂ  Mansell, et quitter l'ÃƒÂ©curie, mÃƒÂ©content de ne pas ÃƒÂªtre clairement le numÃƒÂ©ro 1. De plus, en raison de divergences avec Williams, Honda dÃƒÂ©cide de motoriser McLaren., 28335=Pour rester en haut de l'affiche, Williams se doit de s'allier ÃƒÂ  un grand constructeur et de passer aux moteurs 1.5L turbocompressÃƒÂ©s, ÃƒÂ  la place des vieux Cosworth DFV 3.0L. C'est le cas avec Honda dÃƒÂ¨s la fin de l'annÃƒÂ©e 1983. AprÃƒÂ¨s quelques coups d'ÃƒÂ©clats en 1984, Keke Rosberg et Nigel Mansell emportent chacun deux succÃƒÂ¨s l'annÃƒÂ©e suivante. En 1986, Nelson Piquet rejoint l'ÃƒÂ©curie aux cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©s de Mansell, sur une Williams qui est maintenant la rÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rence. Au Grand Prix d'Australie 1986, Mansell est en position de remporter le titre, mais une crevaison le contraint ÃƒÂ  abandonner. Par mesure de sÃƒÂ©curitÃƒÂ©, Piquet est rappelÃƒÂ© aux stands pour changer de pneus, ce qui va permettre ÃƒÂ  Alain Prost de remporter son second titre, malgrÃƒÂ© une McLaren globalement moins compÃƒÂ©titive. NÃƒÂ©anmoins, l'ÃƒÂ©curie remporte le titre constructeur, une implacable domination que ne parvient mÃƒÂªme pas ÃƒÂ  troubler l'accident de la route qui laisse Frank Williams paralysÃƒÂ©, cette mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e., 43908=DÃƒÂ©but 2000, Williams bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ficie de nouveau d'un moteur d'usine BMW. Alessandro Zanardi est remplacÃƒÂ© par le jeune espoir Jenson Button. MalgrÃƒÂ© les craintes hivernales en raison de problÃƒÂ¨mes de fiabilitÃƒÂ© rÃƒÂ©currents, la saison est une rÃƒÂ©ussite. Ralf Schumacher signe trois podiums ÃƒÂ  Melbourne, ÃƒÂ  Spa et ÃƒÂ  Monza. Button confirme les espoirs placÃƒÂ©s en lui et l'ÃƒÂ©quipe termine troisiÃƒÂ¨me du championnat., 34582=En 1991, Nigel Mansell remplace Boutsen. AprÃƒÂ¨s des dÃƒÂ©buts difficiles, la FW14 devient redoutable et remporte sept victoires. Toutefois, l'avance prise par Ayrton Senna en dÃƒÂ©but de saison lui permet d'ÃƒÂªtre sacrÃƒÂ© champion du monde., 70991=En Autriche, les deux voitures se qualifient en premiÃƒÂ¨re ligne, Massa en pole-position, Bottas ÃƒÂ  la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me place. Mais en course, il devront s'effacer devant les Mercedes de Nico Rosberg et de Lewis Hamilton. Bottas monte sur son premier podium en Formule 1, le premier de l'ÃƒÂ©curie depuis la victoire de Pastor Maldonado depuis le Grand Prix d'Espagne 2012. Massa termine quatriÃƒÂ¨me., 33289=Frank Williams, qui a perdu son champion, se rabat sur le moteur Judd en 1988, en attendant le moteur Renault Sport prÃƒÂ©vu pour 1989. L'annÃƒÂ©e est difficile, ÃƒÂ©gayÃƒÂ©e par deux podiums de Nigel Mansell, qui rejoint Ferrari ÃƒÂ  la fin de l'annÃƒÂ©e., 45328=En 2002, Williams fait figure de premier challenger de Ferrari. Si l'ÃƒÂ©quipe finit seconde au championnat, cette saison est une dÃƒÂ©ception car Williams finit trÃƒÂ¨s loin de Ferrari (129 pts) et ne remporte qu'une victoire, ÃƒÂ  Sepang., 34377=En 1990, malgrÃƒÂ© les victoires de Boutsen ÃƒÂ  Budapest et de Patrese ÃƒÂ  Imola, la saison est une dÃƒÂ©ception et Williams termine quatriÃƒÂ¨me du championnat du monde., 62810=AprÃƒÂ¨s le retour du moteur Renault, le 16 janvier 2012, Williams annonce la titularisation de Bruno Senna en tant que deuxiÃƒÂ¨me pilote, aux cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©s de Pastor Maldonado[9],[10]. Le 28 fÃƒÂ©vrier 2012, Alexander Wurz est engagÃƒÂ© pour aider les pilotes Bruno Senna et Pastor Maldonado et partager son expÃƒÂ©rience de la course[11]., 65774=La saison 2013 est catastrophique car la Williams FW35, monoplace ratÃƒÂ©e, est incapable de viser les points ÃƒÂ  la rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨re. Ainsi, Bottas inscrit 4 points en terminant huitiÃƒÂ¨me du Grand Prix des ÃƒÂ‰tats-Unis tandis que Maldonado se classe dixiÃƒÂ¨me en Hongrie. Avec 5 points, l'ÃƒÂ©curie termine neuviÃƒÂ¨me du championnat du monde., 68076=En 2014, le moteur Renault est remplacÃƒÂ© par celui de Mercedes-Benz. CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© pilotes, Felipe Massa remplace Pastor Maldonado parti chez Lotus F1 Team, Valtteri Bottas ÃƒÂ©tant reconduit., 37736=En 1997, malgrÃƒÂ© une FW19 supÃƒÂ©rieure ÃƒÂ  la concurrence, Villeneuve doit attendre la derniÃƒÂ¨re course pour ÃƒÂªtre sacrÃƒÂ© face ÃƒÂ  Schumacher et Ferrari. Williams est ÃƒÂ©galement champion avec huit victoires, les sept de Villeneuve ajoutÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ  celle obtenue par Frentzen au Grand Prix de Saint-Marin., 56731=Le 19 novembre 2009, Frank Williams et Patrick Head annoncent avoir vendu une part minoritaire de leur ÃƒÂ©curie ÃƒÂ  une sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© d'investissement dirigÃƒÂ©e par l'Autrichien Christian Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â TotoÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» Wolff qui rejoint ÃƒÂ©galement le directoire de la sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©[1]. Wolff est notamment connu pour avoir remportÃƒÂ© les 24 Heures de DubaÃƒÂ¯ 2006 en catÃƒÂ©gorie GT et pour son record du tour de la Nordschleife du NÃƒÂ¼rburgring au volant dÃ¢Â€Â™une Porsche 997 RSR en avril 2009[2]. Un peu plus d'un an plus tard, Frank Williams dit envisager une entrÃƒÂ©e en bourse[3]., 40548=1999 est une annÃƒÂ©e de transition, en attendant BMW. Le moteur est toujours un Mecachrome/Supertec, mais Villeneuve et Frentzen sont partis, remplacÃƒÂ©s par Alessandro Zanardi et Ralf Schumacher. L'Italien est la dÃƒÂ©ception de l'annÃƒÂ©e, ne marquant aucun point. Ralf rÃƒÂ©alise en revanche de bonnes performances, montant ÃƒÂ  trois reprises sur le podium (ÃƒÂ  Melbourne, Silverstone et Monza) et inscrivant 35 points. Williams ne termine que cinquiÃƒÂ¨me du championnat., 65187=Maldonado inscrit quatre nouveaux points grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  sa huitiÃƒÂ¨me place en Chine, avant de s'illustrer lors du Grand Prix d'Espagne oÃƒÂ¹ il obtient sa premiÃƒÂ¨re pole position et remporte la premiÃƒÂ¨re victoire de sa carriÃƒÂ¨re, la premiÃƒÂ¨re de Williams depuis 2004. Le dernier succÃƒÂ¨s du partenariat Williams-Renault remontait au Grand Prix du Luxembourg 1997., 47073=En 2005, Mark Webber et Nick Heidfeld remplacent Montoya et Ralf Schumacher mais la FW27 n'est pas trÃƒÂ¨s performante et ils ne peuvent apporter plus que quelques podiums ÃƒÂ  Sepang, Monaco et au NÃƒÂ¼rburgring. BMW annonce son dÃƒÂ©part ÃƒÂ  mi-saison en rachetant Sauber et les performances plongentÃ‚Â : plus aucun podium et AntÃƒÂ´nio Pizzonia remplace Heidfeld en fin de saison., 52186=En 2006, Cosworth remplace BMW et Bridgestone remplace Michelin qui ÃƒÂ©quipait l'ÃƒÂ©quipe depuis 2001. La saison est la pire de l'ÃƒÂ©curie depuis 1977 avec seulement 11 points inscrits et aucun podium. Les pilotes Mark Webber et le dÃƒÂ©butant Nico Rosberg ne peuvent pallier les performances d'un matÃƒÂ©riel rÃƒÂ©tif, notamment un moteur peu fiable. Ainsi, quelques coups d'ÃƒÂ©clats sont vite avortÃƒÂ©s par des ennuis de fiabilitÃƒÂ©., 58117=En 2010, Williams perd Nico Rosberg parti chez Mercedes Grand Prix et se sÃƒÂ©pare de Kazuki Nakajima, protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© de Toyota qui quitte la discipline. L'ÃƒÂ©curie est dÃƒÂ©sormais motorisÃƒÂ©e par Cosworth et les nouveaux pilotes sont Rubens Barrichello, troisiÃƒÂ¨me du championnat ÃƒÂ©coulÃƒÂ© et Nico HÃƒÂ¼lkenberg, champion GP2 2009 dÃƒÂ¨s sa premiÃƒÂ¨re participation. AprÃƒÂ¨s un dÃƒÂ©but de saison difficile, l'ÃƒÂ©quipe rÃƒÂ©alise une seconde partie de saison intÃƒÂ©ressante, qui lui permet de terminer ÃƒÂ  la sixiÃƒÂ¨me place du championnat des constructeurs. Le coup d'ÃƒÂ©clat de la saison est rÃƒÂ©alisÃƒÂ© par Nico HÃƒÂ¼lkenberg qui signe la pole position ÃƒÂ  Interlagos sur une piste sÃƒÂ©chante. Il devient, ÃƒÂ  23 ans et 79 jours, le sixiÃƒÂ¨me plus jeune poleman de l'histoire de la Formule 1 et permet ÃƒÂ  Williams de dÃƒÂ©crocher sa 126e pole position, sa premiÃƒÂ¨re depuis 2005.}","Sat, 18 Jul 2015 17:52:02 GMT",

Each singer was clearly accustomed to performing as a solo, and their banter in this informal song pull was both friendly and also a bit awkward, with Seeger getting the worst of it, if only because his typical affected casualness came to seem a little more affected than usual. Nevertheless, after joining together on ""Midnight Special,"" the two managed some representative individual performances from their repertories, ranging from Broonzy's mixture of old folk songs and old pop songs (""The Glory of Love,"" ""Why Don't You Come Home Bill Bailey"") to Seeger's politically oriented folk (the anti-war ""Mrs. McGrath""), and borrowed classical material (""Goofin' Off Suite,"" with its Beethoven arranged for banjo). The editing of the tape is sometimes abrupt, and as the singers reach the end of the disc, they make it sound like they're just breaking for intermission. But both come off effectively before an appreciative audience.

An important feature of roads in such environments is the existence of pavements or curbs on either side defining the road boundaries. These curbs, which are mostly parallel to the road, can be hardnessed to extract useful features of the road for implementing autonomous navigation or driver assistance systems. However, extraction of the curb or road edge feature using vision image data is a very formidable task as the curb is not conspicuous in the vision image. To extract the curb using vision data requires extensive image processing, heuristics and very favorable ambient lighting. In our approach, road curbs are extracted speedily using range data provided by a 2D Laser range Measurement System (LMS).

Unemployment is projected to be an annual average of 8.3 percent in 2012, before falling to 7.9 percent in 2013, 7.4 percent in 2014, and 6.7 percent in 2015. The estimates for 2012 to 2014 are 0.5 percentage point lower than the projections in the last survey. The outlook for growth in the U.S. economy looks mostly unchanged from that of three months ago, according to 45 forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The panel expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate of 2.2 percent this quarter, down from the previous estimate of 2.4 percent.

Rather than a regular framework, it is a collection of orthogonal modules for the model, view and controller part. I will try to release the regular-web package and possibly work on the Basil library. 2.12 Pesto Hackers: Jasper Van der Jeugt, Simon Meier There are several HTML combinator libraries on hackage, but we still need one that is *really* fast. This is attempt to tackle the problem described here. A simple API proposal can be found here, but that's only one idea.

The number of electrons in each of yttrium's shells is [2, 8, 18, 9, 2] and its electron configuration is [Kr] 4d1 5s2. The yttrium atom has a radius of 180 pm and a Van der Waals radius of 219 pm. Yttrium was discovered by Johann Gadolin in 1794 and first isolated by Carl Gustav Mosander in 1840. In its elemental form, Yttrium has a silvery white metallic appearance. Yttrium has the highest thermodynamic affinity for oxygen of any element. Yttrium is not found in nature as a free element and is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals. While not part of the rare earth series, it resembles the heavy rare earths which are sometimes referred to as the ""yttrics"" for this reason. Another unique characteristic derives from its ability to form crystals with useful properties. The name yttrium originated from a Swedish village near Vaxholm called Yttbery where it was discovered. For more information on yttrium, including properties, safety data, research, and American Elements' catalog of yttrium products, visit the Yttrium element page.}",,

It was the only place remotely worth living for the cost of housing. If you are able to afford the $500 per semester to bring you car on campus do it.

And Gengras Cafe is decent, but I could never manage to keep it under the meal equivalency price."", ""It was definitely not worth all the frustration that comes with arrogant students and ill-mannered faculty. Not to mention that I learned next to nothing in my classes. I felt like I did the minimal work required and still finished with an A in every class, even when I was out for a month and a half. The University is overpriced, especially when you consider that you're living in a cinderblock room with a tile floor for $42,000 a year."", ""There are not any events set up by the school or any groups / clubs of the school on the weekends. There is really nothing to do if you're not a big drinker and you don't have a car to get off campus. There are buses that will take you off campus on the weekends, but the last bus runs at about 7 p.m. You can take a taxi, but they're very overpriced and get expensive after awhile especially after a night of shopping at the mall. A good deal of the student body comes from much more privileged families than I did and they came off as insolent. There are a few in particular that I can remember such as the guy who threw his $400 Blackberry on the floor and remarked that the next day he would have a brand new iPhone that his father would buy him and sure enough he did. And when he dropped that one, he had a brand new one the next day. It's as if they have a constant money supply coming to them and they have a total lack of respect towards the hard work it actually takes to make money. I also had an awful roommate, which I am sure had a significant part in my dissatisfaction of the school. I was able to stick it out most of the year and spend a good deal of time outside of my room away from her, but she was very sick and refused to go to Health Services. Because she was spreading germs all over our room, I got mono and needed to be hospitalized. I had to stay home for a month and a half and within that month and a half, I found out just how much I disliked UHa. It took many games of phone tag to find the appropriate person to notify of my medical leave. When I finally found out who to call, it took me 6 calls to even get the Dean of Students on the phone. I left many messages and she, rather conveniently, could not find the time to call me back until after the last day you could get any money back after dropping a class. Also, when she said everything was taken care of, it was most certainly not. I began getting e-mails from my professors saying that they had never received proper notification of my leave and if they did not get it soon, they would have to mark me absent and i would fail the class. Some teachers would not give me the work I missed until they received the notification and I wound up having to drop an additional class as a result. After another 10 calls I finally got her to notify my professors and drop the other class. Now keep in mind that I was sleeping about 18 hours a day throughout all this. The other 6 hours I had to spend on the phone with the Dean of Students Office. It was completely ridiculous and I can't say that the people I talked to were anything but rude. When I finally got back to school, my roommate began staying up until 4 a.m. every night and keeping me up as well. I contacted my RD and asked to have my room changed immediately. I slept in the common room and on my friend's floor for 3 weeks before anyone in Residential Life did anything about it. In addition to the Dean of Students being rude on the phone, anyone you speak to about financial aid or loans is also incredibly rude on the phone. In fact there are probably only 10 staff members that I spoke to that I did not find to be rude."", ""I only attended UHa for my freshman year. I took a lot of unnecessary intro courses, such as Intro to Computers. I was a Multimedia Web Design and Development major.

Be ready to be ignored. The staff will pretend to be enthusiastic to help you until enter the school. It's impossible to get anything done unless you go to their office a few times and stick whatever you need to get done in their face, and maybe they will sit down and work stuff out with you. 2. Hawk hall? I've never lived in the Hawk hall, but everyone around me seems to enjoy it, and the condition of the building is way better than the freshman dorms. Also you have the option of living off campus during your freshman year. If you are not a very social person like me, it would be a good option to consider. But you will have to own a car because the neighborhood is very dangerous. 3. The Hartt School is not as great as you think. I think the Hartt School received its fame in the 1980s, but since then it has deteriorated. Lack of dedication from many of the students and the non-responsive administrative faculty are my major complaints. 4. If you have already taken a tour of the campus. Yes, it is a very attractive campus with all the greenery and the river that runs through. Occasionally you will see ducks, geese, chipmunks, and some other animals not known to me. So bring a camera, the scenery is in your tuition."", ""Everything is overpriced here. It really makes you wonder where the $44,000 tuition goes to when you see the condition of the buildings here, and consider the fact that most professors are adjunct professors, which means they don't get paid a lot."", ""This school gives me the impression that almost everyone does drugs and drinks on weekends. I am not sure about everyone having sex, but I was kept out of my room a few times, the latest until 2 in the morning because he had someone over. It's definitely a partying school, so if you are not the partying type like myself, I would recommend that you pay a few hundred dollars a semester to have your car on campus. It gets quite boring around here during weekends when everyone around you are at parties and you are alone in your dorm because you don't drink."", ""Although there are some classes that are worth a while, many classes are a waste of time. Same goes to the professors. As a music major, the reason I decided to attend University of Hartford is because of the particular professor I would like to study with.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""Students here at UHart tend to be carefree and very, very friendly. Almost always the person in front holds the door open for others coming through, which I think is very nice. (It's my personal pet-peeve; I've noticed that this is often an indication of a healthy, kind environment). My classmates would always help me when I had trouble figuring something out, and it was easy to make friends with the people sitting around me. The people at UHart are very easy to talk to. However, not everything is fun and games. They are also hardworking and won't hesitate to turn down an invite to a party if they know they have serious work to finish first. When I was having trouble finishing a Lit essay, my new friend urged me to finish, going with me to the library and keeping me from procrastinating on Facebook. So basically, I think UHart creates a positive environment for any type of serious student."", ""College life is far better than high school, in my opinion. There is no 'busy-work' and students are left with plenty of time and the responsibility to do their own work. Just be certain to pay attention in lectures, take proper notes, and begin early on the many projects and papers assigned to you. Basically- don't procrastinate. As long as you manage your time well, I am sure you will do just fine in the college of your choice."", ""I believe UHart offers much for the money we students pay. I can see it's worth it; the professors are all very intelligent and professional, and are 'there for their students.' Although I had a little trouble at first with communication, after my Literature professor told me that I could -and should- come to him if I was having trouble I had no problems contacting my professors when I needed help; I would email them and arrange a time to meet and they would be very accommodating. The courses are also wonderful, and there were so many offered that I had trouble deciding which ones to take my first semester."", ""Choosing UHart was one of the best decisions of my life. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in with college life and make friends, but surprisingly (or, perhaps, not so) I adjusted to life here very quickly. My first semester schedule included classes such as Freshman Dialogue, and Time Management that focused specifically on allowing new, incoming students to adjust to the college workload. Those proved to be very useful for me. Although registration week is a very busy time for college students, I was able to sign up for most of the courses I wanted. I relied heavily upon my freshman adviser for help with this, and she was more than willing to give me a hand. Although I know next semester I won't be able to see my new friends as often, I can always hang out with them after classes and am looking forward to making new friends during the new year."", ""There are a great many variety of courses offered at UHart. Since I am in the Honors program, many of them are vigorous and require more time and effort than most courses. However, it's worth it because we cover that much more material and go into depth, which I find especially wonderful if it is a topic I enjoy. There are also other easier courses. For example, I'm an English major and math is one subject I'm not good at. However, since 3 credits of math is required I was able to take the easiest math course available, one created specifically at UHart for students like me, called Contemporary Mathematics. I still learned a lot in that course, but the work load was reduced which was very convenient for me since my first semester I was busy writing multiple essays a week for my other, more intensive classes.""]]",University of Hartford Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Hartford/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/76986,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,18,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00008-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,896423427,896344432,HORIZONTAL,"08/02/2009 Reviewer is A past student here. 23 out of 33 people found this review useful. 6 people found it offensive. 7 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 85 Carolyn from Naugatuck, CT Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

College is a place where you get to experience new things, so for my first tip: 1. Keep an open mind to new possibilities and opportunities. Keeping a close mind won't allow you to explore different aspects of college. Tip 2: Lower your expectations. When I was first attending Hartford, I had high expectations. Hartford hadn't met most of my expectations. Especially the fact it didn't have a football team; I was highly disappointed. I figured if I went in not expecting too much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Tip 3: Always stay on top of your own education career. Meaning use your Advisor for what he/she is meant for advice. You only control your school path. Advisors will not map your school path. They'll give you advice as to what you probably should do. Its okay to disagree with your advisor and begin following your own choices. Start figuring out what classes would go best with your major, how many credits you've taken so far, how long you intend on being in school for, and etc. I've attended Hillyer College; and many of my friends in Hillyer have told me how their advisor screw them over. Other friends I've spoke to told me they rarely met with their advisor and just chose to control their own path. They started speaking to professors and dean of their fields (majors). Tip 4: College is ultimately what you make it. Don't expect fun to come to you. Make your own adventures and fun. Make a group of good friends and just enjoy yourself. Remember academics first, yourself second, and friends third. Once in that order college will be everything you want it to be."", 'University of Hartford is very diverse, both racially and academically. There are several activities throughout the year to help students achieve their college experience.

After talking with someone in the SSC (Student Success Center), I found solutions to my problems and felt at home, especially with friendly staff members checking in on me every now and then like they were my parents! On an unrelated note, for any incoming freshman living on campus-- try to live in either A or B complex or Hawk Hall! A-Complex is a freshman dorm and isn't as far away from all the action as C, D, E, or F complex! B-Complex is literally the perfect complex-- and I'm not just saying that because I live there now! It's right beside the main dining hall, Commons, it's backyard opens into Alumni Plaza (center where everything and everyone meets, Commons, path to The Village Market, bridge to the academic side of campus located here) so everything is way more easy to get to! Hawk Hall is great too-- I got into Hawk Hall but enjoyed living in the complexes so much that I refused! But it's a gorgeous building and the rooms are all really nice there! It's also right in Alumni Plaza, so it's convenient to live there!"", ""University of Hartford is a wonderful school, situated in a quaint and quiet area in West Hartford, CT. The campus is the perfect size-- not too small, but small enough, clean, and beautiful. With a super-friendly staff, helpful Red Caps to guide you around campus when you're lost during the first week, and a very accepting and welcoming community, you'll never feel too alone there and you'll always have fun finding something to do!""]]",University of Hartford Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Hartford/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/76986,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,47,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00008-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,896423427,896344432,HORIZONTAL,"08/02/2009 Reviewer is A past student here. 23 out of 33 people found this review useful. 6 people found it offensive. 7 people found this inaccurate. 1 of 85 Carolyn from Naugatuck, CT Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For a state that is so accustomed to snow in the winter, the university really needs to learn to keep up with the plowing of roads and ESPECIALLY sidewalks. Every day when I step out my front door in the winter, I almost break my neck from the amount of ice that hardened under the unplowed areas of snow. What are we paying for if such simple tasks can't be met? The grass is never well-kept either in the spring, especially in high traffic areas, it can turn into a mud pit sometimes. Anyone is allowed to have a car on campus, but there is barely enough parking available, and the cost is RIDICULOUS."", ""Greek life or join a club or a team.

Thursdays....everybody knows. (if you're 21+...)"", ""I hear they're re-doing commons? The quality of the food is sometimes questionable, and people avoid commons because they usually have to hit the restrooms 20 minutes later. The Hawk's Nest is alright, but the choices of food never change, and the service is SO SLOW. On top of that, they always mess up. Gengras is the best dining option for sure, but it's closed on weekends."", ""The complexes........ I lived in Dirty D Comp, it was the spot at the time. The dorms look like government housing or something, but they're slowly but surely making improvements. RA's are actually really, really nice and for the most part cool/interesting people. Freshman have no choice, they all have to live in the complexes. At least they have AC. The Village is the party spot for sure, considering it is mostly upperclassmen living with pre-arranged groups of friends in apartment-style dorms. The apartments have a full kitchen and everything. They would be pretty nice if they weren't so run down, but regardless, its still a good time. Warm weather brings EVERYONE outside in all 7 quads. If you look at a map of the school and make proper inferences, you can most likely guess where the 24 hour quiet-hour apartments are, and where the party apartments are. Park River is hallway-style apartments, and it is the newest and nicest place to live on campus. Park River is the only upperclassmen housing that is air conditioned, and it is located right near the market. Don't know much more about it. Regents is the worst. Walking through the halls of regents feels like you are walking down one of those collapsable hallways that you take to board an airplane. It is so, SO loud, because the walls are so thin, residents can hear every move practically anyone in their whole wing makes. That really isn't dramatic, either. The good thing about Regents: BIG bathroom mirror, and BIG closets with built in organizing shelfs and drawers."", ""Hillyer kind of ruined my life :/ don't do it if you don't have to!!

The Rhetoric and Writing classes had busy work curriculum. I did not learn a single thing in either of them and I was taking them on the honors level. I did most of my learning at my job in the Faculty Center for Learning Development (FCLD), where I could apply what I learned in my AUCT150 class on HTML and CSS. I had previous knowledge of HTML and CSS so what I did learn in that class was minimal. Also the exams for that class were online so the majority of students just opened another tab in Firefox and Googled for answers.

OpenGL only allows ""RED"", ""RG"", ""RGB"", or ""RGBA""; other combinations are not allowed as internal image formats. The size is the bitdepth for each component. The type indicates which of the 5 types mentioned above the format is stored as. No type at all means normalized unsigned integers. For other types, the following suffixes are used:  GL_[components][size][type] OpenGL has a particular syntax for writing its color format enumerants. It looks like this:  Image formats do not have to store each component. When the shader samples such a texture, it will still resolve to a 4-value RGBA vector. The components not stored by the image format are filled in automatically. Zeros are used if R, G, or B is missing, while a missing Alpha always resolves to 1.  Signed normalized integer formats","GL_RGB9_E5: This one is complicated. It is an RGB format of type floating-point. The 3 color values have 9 bits of precision, and they share a single exponent. The computation for these values is not as simple as for GL_R11F_G11F_B10F, and they aren't appropriate for everything. But they can provide better results than that format if most of the colors in the image have approximately the same exponent, or are too small to be significant. This is a required format, but it is not required for renderbuffers; do not expect to be able to render to these. sRGB colorspace Normally, colorspaces are assumed to be linear. However, it is often useful to provide color values in non-linear colorspaces. OpenGL provides support for the sRGB colorspace with two formats: GL_SRGB8: sRGB image with no alpha. GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8: sRGB image with a linear Alpha. These are normalized integer formats. When used as a render target, OpenGL will automatically convert the output colors into the sRGB colorspace. The alpha will be written as given. Compressed formats Texture compression is a valuable memory-saving tool, one that you should use whenever it is applicable. There are two kinds of compressed formats in OpenGL: generic and specific. Generic formats don't have any particular internal representation. OpenGL implementations are free to do whatever it wants to the data, including using a regular uncompressed format if it",True,1,0,,,
