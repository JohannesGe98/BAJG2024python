The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011.

UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other college but they do offer financial aid and have scholarships available. UC Merced also has job opportunities from Teacher's Assistant to Library Student Assistant to Catering. Also, the education a student receives at UC Merced is worth it. Am enjoying being here The people here are great and very supportive and the town is small which is a definite",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment.

Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it!

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it!

Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year.

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid.

The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

This university is still growing which will provide a lot of opportunities for students to make the most out of it. New clubs are always being made and just recently, a friend of mine pushed members of a committee to give her credit as a triple major. UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad.

Both are very beautiful and make good places to relax and calm down from the stresses of college life.', ""There's definitely a lot of bang for your buck, you get a wholesome education, not only from the courses and degree, but from the people and how great friendships develop and thrive. Merced's biggest strength is the sense of community. It's small but very close, and we all look out for one another, teachers and faculty included."", ""There are a ton of things to do for fun. Merced's night sky is gorgeous, so stargazing is always interesting. In town, there is a nickel arcade, a mall, and plenty of food places, as well as two major movie theaters. The Office of Student Life is always planning something, be it a Bhangra Bash or a concert, or maybe a Job fair, things along those lines, in the main quad on campus, so most weekends are jam-packed with activities!"", ""The Dining Center at Merced is alright at best. There isn't much variety, and the food quality itself is mediocre, but the biggest drawback is that none of the options are very healthy, nor appetizing. Don't expect gourmet meals and fancy silverware. It's a canteen, it's enough to get by on, and at least it's edible."", ""Dorm life at Merced is excellent. Everyone is friendly, and the Resident Advisors are all very well-qualified. You are expected to do your part to keep the peace and the serenity, but that isn't so difficult. There are two types of housing on campus; suite-style and community-style. The suite-style buildings have one bathroom per every 2 rooms, and the community-style buldings have one community bathroom per 4 rooms. They are well-maintained and are relatively new, so they are in very good condition. Facilities are clean and well-kept, and any problems with furniture or other parts of your room are solved within a few days, at most 4. Overall, they are very satisfactory and I have no complaints."", 'In terms of academic rigor, UC Merced is not a walk in the park. The most challenging courses are related to the Engineering majors, but every class is taken very seriously. There is no such thing as an Easy-A class here. In every course, you must take notes. You must attend lectures regularly, you must take your education very seriously in order to succeed. A college acceptance is one thing, but keeping your spot as a student here is another.', ""There is plenty of room for everyone here! If you are serious about your education, you'll find there are plenty of resources to keep you on the right track and to help you in your academic endeavors. Especially in science- and engineering-related fields, there are many research opportunities that you don't need to fight tooth and nail for, contrary to other University of California campuses. If you're interested in Humanities as well, there are always ongoing social experiments that anyone can take part in. UC Merced is a suburban campus. It is far enough from town to thrive as its own community, but still close enough to have a fun day out. If you want city life, but to keep nature close, this place is perfect. But, just because the atmosphere is comfortable doesn't mean that the academics are as comfortable either. Classes are very rigorous and challenging but nothing a little hard work cannot overcome."", ""UC Merced's student body is very dynamic and incredibly diverse. There is enough healthy competition in terms of grades and intellect to keep you on your toes, but it seldom gets out of hand or progresses into negative behavior. The campus atmosphere is relaxed and very well-balanced, and if you enjoy nature's beauty this campus is perfect for you. There are lakes and paths on campus to relax near during finals week, there is always some type of cultural performance or event in front of the Kolligian Library, and everyone is very friendly and comfortable.""]]",University of California-Merced (UC Merced) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Merced/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/81566,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,89,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00229-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898669167,898548367,HORIZONTAL,"12/03/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 32 out of 32 people found this review useful. 1 of 138 Gabriel from Hercules, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

This university is still growing which will provide a lot of opportunities for students to make the most out of it. New clubs are always being made and just recently, a friend of mine pushed members of a committee to give her credit as a triple major. UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center.

There is currently only one dining common to eat at. Inside the dining commons are multiple stations for you to choose from i.e. the Grill, Asian Kitchen, etc. You choose what you want and then pay the cashier with either cash/credit or, if you live on campus, with your Catcard (student ID). Other places to eat on campus are the Market which (like the dining commons) is also located by the dorms down the hill, and the Lantern which is located on the first floor of the library (closer to the classrooms).', 'I highly recommend living in the suites (Valley Terraces). I lived in Kern Hall for the first two years that I lived on campus. The suites are pretty spacious. You can choose to live in a two room-suite or a three room-suite. All suites come with a living room and a big bathroom to share. You can think of it as a mini-apartment on campus. If you want more of the stereotypical dorm life as seen on TV, you may want to choose the other dorm options. Every year more and more dorms are being built.', 'I would imagine that the academic rigor at UC Merced is just like any other UC. I have heard from one of my professors that the academic curriculum is actually stricter than other UCs because UC Merced is still under review by the UC system. If you want good grades or to simply pass the class, make like a good student and attend classes, take notes, visit professors and TAs at office hours, ask questions for things you do not understand, and study/review frequently so you do not pull an all nighter the day before an exam. I am a firm believer that hard work really does pay off. Do not depend of grade curving--you should get whatever grade you get for your hard work.', ""Remember that going to college is a huge step for your life. I think the most important thing that you can do is try to go into college with an open mind. If you come to UC Merced as someone who views the school as too small and as a place where there is nothing to do, then you will probably not enjoy your next four or five years here. Remember that every school needs to begin somewhere; all schools are essentially built in the middle of nowhere so that the schools have the ability to expand. If you do choose to attend UC Merced, keep an open mind--get to know your dormmates (I would recommend living in the suites), get to know your professors and TAs (they will make your classes easier and more enjoyable), join a few clubs that you might have the tiniest interest in (you might actually end up loving them), join that sports team, sign up for a trip to Yosemite through the school, visit the Career Counselor, take up that leadership position--when you get over the idea of there's nothing to do in Merced and see the bigger picture you will see that there really is a lot to do."", 'UC Merced is still a relatively new school that has a great potential to grow and develop; once you get over the small size, you will see that there is a lot more to the school and the town. One of the perks of attending a new school is being able to easily implement changes i.e. new clubs or organizations; student voices can be easily heard.

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year.

I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid.

The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid.

There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness.

This university is still growing which will provide a lot of opportunities for students to make the most out of it. New clubs are always being made and just recently, a friend of mine pushed members of a committee to give her credit as a triple major. UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim.

This university is still growing which will provide a lot of opportunities for students to make the most out of it. New clubs are always being made and just recently, a friend of mine pushed members of a committee to give her credit as a triple major. UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other college but they do offer financial aid and have scholarships available. UC Merced also has job opportunities from Teacher's Assistant to Library Student Assistant to Catering. Also, the education a student receives at UC Merced is worth it. Am enjoying being here The people here are great and very supportive and the town is",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment.

UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics.

It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

It is easy to make friends here. UC Merced is such a mesh of different people, cultures, ideas, and personalities that anyone can make friends.

The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment.

UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it!

I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

The teachers are so passionate about the classes that they teach and they really do care about their students. Although UC Merced does not have a lot majors compared to the other UC campuses, this gives an opportunity for other students to create these majors which will also give later students more possibilities when choosing a major.

Students who are interested in watching something grow and change right in front of them--I would say that UCM is great for the laid-back but adventurous sort. Tips for prospective students",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other college but they do offer financial aid and have scholarships available. UC Merced also has job opportunities from Teacher's Assistant to Library Student Assistant to Catering. Also, the education a student receives at UC Merced is worth it. Am enjoying being here The people here are great and very supportive and the town is small which is a definite plus if one enjoys the serenity and quiet life more than hustle and bustle. It is easy to make friends here. UC Merced is such a mesh of different people, cultures, ideas, and personalities that anyone can make friends. Am learning a lot Although UC Merced may be a young, small school, the class sizes are not so large for one to be so bored and fall asleep. The teachers are",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The teachers are so passionate about the classes that they teach and they really do care about their students. Although UC Merced does not have a lot majors compared to the other UC campuses, this gives an opportunity for other students to create these majors which will also give later students more possibilities when choosing a major.

Students who are interested in watching something grow and change right in front of them--I would say that UCM is great for the laid-back but adventurous sort. Tips for prospective students",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

This university is still growing which will provide a lot of opportunities for students to make the most out of it. New clubs are always being made and just recently, a friend of mine pushed members of a committee to give her credit as a triple major. UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

They try to accommodate everyone. For instance sometimes if financial aid cover a lot then you can end up only having to pay no more than 800 dollars for tuition although it varies for everyone.

It just takes some getting used too. If your a person that can eat burgers and pizza all day then good because there are many types of burgers and pizzas. But the school could use more food variety but its understandable because it is a small campus.

They also provide a student coffee shop as well as a small market place to get basic groceries.', 'The student housing puts on lots of fun events for students living in the dorms. These events help you make friends in your hall as well as from other dorms around campus. Also whatever type of dorm you get (single, double, tripple, or quad) all the dorms are new and provide a lot of space for studying and relaxation.', 'I find all my classes to be extremely fair, and the professors are very reasonable. As long as you stay on top of your reading do your homework getting good grades should be fairly easy. Office hours are very important at this university it gives you a chance to familiarize yourself with the professor as well as getting a different perspective on learning through teachers assistants.', ""One of the first difficulties I encountered was there are very few art related courses so don't expect a great variety. One great resource to use is the many Facebook pages that connect current students that enable them to get first hand information on classes, buying books, and transportation so make sure to take advantage of them. Also Merced is very close to Yosemite so my mom bought me a Yosemite season pass which came in handy when me and my friends wanted to leave Merced for the weekend and go camping."", 'UC Merced is a really good school if your interested in Natural Sciences, Engineering, or Psychology, because it is a new university they offer research opportunities for undergraduates in these fields. Also because it is a small campus the class sizes are small and professors have more time to spend with individual students. There are tons of fun events put on by the school such as carnivals, art galleries, and social events which makes for a good on or off campus student life.']]",University of California-Merced (UC Merced) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Merced/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/81566,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,115,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00229-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898669167,898548367,HORIZONTAL,"12/03/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 32 out of 32 people found this review useful. 1 of 138 Gabriel from Hercules, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment.

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it!

I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

UC Merced gives students possibilities to make it their college. Tips for prospective students Always visit potential colleges before making a decision and apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible so as not to take out so many loans and have to worry about them after graduation. The last thing on a student's mind should be how they will be able to pay off their student loans. Bang for the buck UC Merced is quite expensive just like any other",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

It is easy to make friends here. UC Merced is such a mesh of different people, cultures, ideas, and personalities that anyone can make friends. Am learning a lot Although UC Merced may be a young, small school, the class sizes are not so large for one to be so bored and fall asleep. The teachers are so passionate about the classes that they teach and they really do care about their students. Although UC Merced does not have a lot majors compared to the other UC campuses, this gives an opportunity for other students to create these majors which will also give later students more possibilities when choosing a major.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

UC Merced also has job opportunities from Teacher's Assistant to Library Student Assistant to Catering. Also, the education a student receives at UC Merced is worth it. Am enjoying being here The people here are great and very supportive and the town is small which is a definite plus",True,0,0,"{19130=This is a major case of Your mileage may vary. The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year.

However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

The campus police are seen regularly around campus, and there are stands with call buttons located around campus for anytime someone feels they are in need of being escorted somewhere. During my time attending so far, I have not once felt that I was unsafe on campus.', 'UC Merced is great for the introverted and quiet students. There is always plenty of study space, Lake Yosemite in walking distance for additional study space. You are not pushed to participate in anything you are not interested in.', 'UC Merced provides a significant amount of financial aid, which allows the college experience overall to be more enjoyable. While college education is, in general, extremely pricey, UC Merced is one of the most reasonably priced colleges that I applied to.', 'The University of California Merced is not by any means close to the rest of the city of Merced- it is located more in the outskirts of the city, and isolated. While transportation is provided in terms of a bus system, even in the city of Merced there is not much to do at all. Even if students were to take advantage of the transportation provided, to get to town the bus ride overall can be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour long. In regards to the city of Merced, there really is nothing to do. Students at the University mainly depend on activities that take place on campus for something to do. Events are planned by RAÃƒÂ¢??s and organizations regularly, usually at least once a week. These activities allow students at UC Merced to have something to do, since the city of Merced doesnÃƒÂ¢??t really provide anything significantly fun.', 'The food at UC Merced is something that, while acceptable, could use improvement. While the hours of the dining center seem to be something that everyone has an issue with, the quality of the food should be improved before looking into extending the hours. Some foods at the dining center are of good quality; however others simply taste like typical cafeteria food. While there are few items in the dining center that I refuse to even try, there is a large variety of options to choose from. Even with these options however, at times it seems as if you are eating the same thing day after day, because nothing else seems appetizing. It is an option for students to submit ideas of dishes for the dining center to have- however I feel students are not aware of this option; if they were then there is potential for additional options and variety to be added to the menus in the dining center. Overall, the food somewhat what would be expected out of a high school cafeteria- some options are good while others, not so much.', 'Dorm life at UC Merced makes living on campus significantly more enjoyable. The campus is large enough to enjoy the college atmosphere, yet small enough to where everything students need is within walking distance. All on campus housing is less than a ten minute walk from all classroom buildings, the dining center, and other locations on campus, which is extremely convenient. In regards to the dorms themselves, the different buildings have different living styles- from apartment like suites to traditional dorms with community bathrooms. In all housing buildings the janitorial staff does an amazing job of keeping the buildings clean. The dorm rooms themselves are very cozy and comfortable to live in. The closeness to any building on campus makes the college experience so much more convenient, without having to worry about a building on the opposite side of campus being too long of a walk. The housing buildings are quiet and lounges are peaceful places to study in if you need a change of scenery from your room to study in. The dorm rooms are neither too small nor too big, and are exactly what you would expect when thinking of a typical dorm room in college.', 'It is obvious that the success of students is a top priority at the University of California Merced. The small class sizes contribute significantly to the quality of the classes offered, and being able to form one-on-one relationships with professors. The professors at UC Merced clearly put the success of their students first, and are always willing to answer any questions, and see students outside of class. Free tutoring is offered to students as well, so there is really no reason to be falling behind in any classes. Even if a student did not choose to participate in tutoring, there are plenty of professors and other individuals on campus who are willing to help out. It is not as difficult to get into the classes that you need as it is at some other schools, and advisers are always willing to help you put you on track to graduation, whether itÃƒÂ¢??s through helping you choose what classes to take or answering any other questions you might have.', 'Be aware that the campus is located far from the city of Merced. Other than activities on campus, there is not much to do- and that leaves plenty of time to put academics first.', ""UC Merced is focused on the success of its students.

Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here.

To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help. I believe that what I'm paying to attend UCM is worth it. It's a new school so we get new everything, and plus we get a concert just for UCM students only. In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment. UC Merced also is one of world leading research facilities and have made groundbreaking research in cognitive science, biology and archaeology., 626422=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 133109=UC Merced is the newest UC campus and students get to have their college experience with new facilities. Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011. Two of the buildings on campus have received Gold Leed award for energy efficiency, one of them being the new management building and other the early childhood daycare center. UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid. It's a pain in the butt if you have to do the verification process, but their staff members makes it easy for you. You can get a hold of them real fast and their more than willing to help.

In 2011, LMFAO performed for us and in 2012 we had Travis Porter., 135039=UC Merced provides instructor's at the top of their field and provides undergraduate research opportunities for students which makes UC Merced so unique. The student to teacher ratio averages from 20:1 which is great because we are still paying for a UC education with a private school learning environment.

Recently the school opened their new management building fall of 2011.

UC Merced provides free tutoring where students can benefit from working in groups and combine socializing with class preparation. The Counseling Services are UC Merced offers assistance with test-taking anxiety, stress management and other academic difficulties, in addition to emotional problems. UC Merced has The Bright Success Center that offers workshops on time management, note-taking skills, test-taking strategies and other useful topics. Career Services in Kolligian Library offers free assistance in helping students determine the best career path for your personality type, in addition to general guidance and support in finding your pathway to a meaningful career., 6307=This section all depends on the person and what your preferences are. Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it. Each student is given about 1000 dollars in something called Cat Card and the we can buy pretty much anything we want on campus with it.}",,

I was walking to (or from) class and I look to the lake underneath the bridge that I'm walking on. Just as I was doing that I notice something next to the trees beside me and BAM! there it was. A bobcat statue pouncing. I admit, I jumped when I saw it. I did not expect it there. So of course I told my friend (best friend that attends UCM and came from the same high school). As we were walking to class I pointed it out. Her reaction: Stopped in her tracks, backed up, and gasped. I laughed at her, as any friend would, and made fun of her reaction, not admitting to my earlier response."", ""There is a lake walking distance from the university. It is beautiful during summer. You can visibly see the tree leaves change color from season to season, unlike the trees in LA. You can take buses into town. There are, I think, three theaters in town.

There aren't many stores here but there are a few good places to eat, like Panera Bread."", ""The first few weeks I was amazed by all the choices the dining center offered. Now, I know what to expect when I get there. I feel like I'm out of choices and stuck with eating the same old things. I miss homemade food!!! I want variation in my food.

I live in Mariposa and am glad to be close to the dining center, the gym and the classroom buildings. In Mariposa you only share a bathroom with your suite mates, meaning 5 other girls/boys, rather than 12 like in Cathedral. However, the walls here are very thin. Since the first night, I felt like our upstairs neighbors kept banging their feet against the floor every time they walked and I could hear every time they closed their drawers."", ""The classes are fast-paced as you would expect college classes to be. What I didn't expect was the amount of information that's given to you in a 1-2 hr session class. I feel bombarded with information sometimes and come out of class exhausted. I suggest bringing a drink, mints, or snacks to class in order to keep focused in 2 hr classes."", ""Do not give in to procrastination. Just because you're required to attend a class doesn't mean you can blow them off to go party or hang out with friends. You're only waisting your money and time. Then, don't spend the next 4 or more years in college worrying every second of the day. Relax, calm down, and enjoy the college life. Basically, find a balance between fun and work.

There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal. Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here.

However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year.

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it! It also means smaller classes and a great opportunity have more office hours to meet the professors! Its new so that means everything on campus is new! I am very excited to attend this school in fall 2011., 49021=I had to pay 29000 dollars and its a lot of money but its worth it.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard. Your CatCard is your ID card that is used for, of course, identification purposes, and for everything else on campus--to access some doors, the key to your room (some rooms), to check out things from the library, and of course, for your meal-plan. So again, you have $2500 for the entire year, $1250 per semester. The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year. Most people end up with a lot of money by the end of the semester (I still have $400 and there's 2 weeks of class left before the end of the semester) while others like my roommate have $47 left for the next two weeks. I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food. To make sure you spend just the right amount, a typical day of food should consist of only 2 meals per day, usually around $10 per meal.

Obviously, as mentioned earlier, if you simply want to learn, then there's no problem at all. However, UC Merced has some perks..some that can be good and some bad. I don't want to spoil everything for you and chase you away/convince you--I want you to form your own opinions based on facts. - UC Merced is in the middle of NOWHERE. There's really nothing to do here. Sure, there are clubs and stuff, parties here and there, the typical (if this is what you were concerned about don't worry haha). The university is about an 8 minute drive to downtown Merced, which is where all the fun is. There are a lot of places to eat in downtown Merced. From In N Out, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and Sonic to Jamba Juice, Apple Bee's, Hometown Buffet, Chinese Buffets, great Indian food places, Steak Houses, BBQ places, and other Merced exclusive food places. The most popular non-partying/drinking thing to do here is go to the movies. There are 2 theaters here, one significantly bigger than the other. The bigger theater has In N Out a 5 minute walk away, while the smaller theater has the Merced Mall a 5 minute walk away and Carl's Jr a 10 minute walk away. Merced Mall is disappointing. It's not your Great Mall or Sunvalley Mall in Concord, or any other big mall. It's more like a medium sized strip with the main shopping stores. I've only been there 2 or 3 times so I can't really remember what they have, but they have some good stuff, and a food court. One troublesome thing is the transportation between UC Merced and downtown Merced. Merced has what are called CatTracks which is basically the free bus system provided for UCM students. (btw if you didn't know already, the UCM mascot is the bobcat) The problem is, it takes approximately 45 minutes to get from UCM to downtown Merced and vice-versa, when a car ride takes about 8 minutes. I've ridden the CatTracks at least 10 times this semester to get downtown and back. It was okay at first, but then I started picking up motion sickness easily, and it was really horrible. Thankfully one of my roommates was able to bring his car after Thanksgiving break. Also, another thing to note is that Freshman that are staying at the Residence Halls (aka dorms) aren't allowed to park their car at the school (aren't allowed to have a parking permit). You're only allowed to have a permit to park at the community college, which is about a 10 minute bike-ride away. The campus itself is nice. It's still fairly new, having been opened since 2005 I believe? The school is also famous for having Michelle Obama at the 08-09' Commencement Ceremony. Whenever I mentioned UC Merced to my friends in high school when I first got accepted, the majority never even heard of it. The school has a lot of opportunities for you, and a lot to offer. I almost forgot--the food. The dining center/commons (aka DC) is a non-profit organization and isn't directly connected to the UC itself (most people don't know this). Thus, a lot of people typically complain about the food here, saying common phrases such as The DC food..ugh.. or DC food again? I want some REAL food. The food here, is better than people exclaim. There is a wide variety of items to choose from. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just be very brief about the food. There's the grill where you can order your hot dogs, burgers, fries, and other items. The Asian section has rice/noodle bowls. The Mexican section has nachos, quesadillas, burritos, and other items. There's a salad bar, a section to make your own sandwich, and a dessert section. There's the pizza section, hot sandwich and smoothie section, refrigerated section (with standard refrigerated foods like microwaveable burritos, string cheese, eggs, milk, yogurt, etc.). There's the Blue Plate section, which is supposedly the healthiest section and has foods that are served at a typical buffet like Hometown Buffet. Finally, there's a fruit section along with a breakfast section that has cereal, a Quiznos-style mini-oven, and your basic breakfast essentials (except for pancakes). Some of the food really is just terrible, but there's a lot of good food here that overpowers the terribleness. Overall, if you're going to school and want to get something out of it, this is the place for you. But if you're the party every weekend type of person, you might be a bit disappointed...might be., 365199=Campus food is campus food, but there are some nice varieties throughout the weeks. The meal plan, instead of giving you a certain number of meals per week, gives you around 1300 dollars per term to work with. That's about 11 dollars a day, which sounds difficult at first, but you can always add more money in, so that's good. My main gripe about the food here is that many of our food options close on the weekends, leaving us with very little choice about what to eat. Overall though, I've been happy with the food here, and it's good enough for me., 115372=This university is small, but I love it!

The leftover money from the $1250 from the 1st semester gets carried over to the 2nd semester, but you have to use it all up by the end of the school year, as the leftover money from 2nd semester doesn't carry onto the next year.

I ended up with a lot of money left because my parents always brought me food from home. My roommate, however, only ate the DC food, plus he spent about $30 per day worth of food.

The University itself is very nice and modern, with facilities that are, while a little limited, very good--the fitness center and the library, in particular. The downside is, of course, that the area surrounding it isn't the most spectacular. It may get a little boring, especially if you don't have a car or a way to get around. It also doesn't have as many activities as other schools, being fairly new. Though, again, there is a greater bond with teachers (15:1 student-teacher ratio!), and the facilities that the school DOES have are top-notch., 77081=As the question says I really feel I am getting the Bang for the Buck here at Merced. There are only 6000 students on Campus as of 2013. We are growing every year. Like I said we are a well kept secret., 3337=If you live on campus, you have a $2500 balance placed on your CatCard.

Meal prices can vary, but it's about $10 average. $10 for a meal...doesn't seem bad right? But in fact, it's terrible at times. Knowing that most students have no other choice but the DC food, they over-charge things. A small bag of Kettle Chips is $1.75. String cheese is $0.97. A banana is around $0.75. An English Muffin, yogurt, string cheese, and Raspberry Candied Almonds costs $8. Many people complain about the price of food here, but you just have to accept the prices. Education-wise, you pay to attend school here (assuming you weren't completely covered by financial aid) and you really do get a bang for your buck. You get a great education here. Many class sizes are restricted to 20 people per discussion section, and lectures usually consist of only 250-300 people max. It's a really small environment, great for learning. However, the trend for the past few years has been that the population of UC Merced has been doubling every year, and expects to continue doing so. However, when UC Merced is critiqued, it might be appreciated for its' small population size, and if it is shown that students perform better in much smaller population conditions, the school might decrease the amount of admissions to the school--but for now, it's definitely increasing greatly every year. You get a solid education here. This is a University of California, the 10th UC, and the 1st UC of the 21st century. Everything is pretty much new. You're truly getting what you pay for, regardless of the food situation at times., 260908=UCM gives out a lot of financial aid.

I passed all my class yet the classes were more difficult than I was expecting. Bang for the buck Going to a school such as Western Nevada College is an excellent way to save on money. Many basic level classes at this school are the exact same content and difficulty-wise as top-flight universities so you might as well take them where they are cheaper. Also, if you rake up enough scholarships, you get a nice check back from the financial office that you can really use for anything. Am enjoying being here With such an excellent demographic make-up it's difficult to not meet new people.

The Commission is proposing amendments to Exchange Act rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 that would address the application of the de minimis exception to security-based swap transactions connected with a non-U.S. person's security-based swap dealing activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of such person's agent, located in a U.S. branch or office. The Commission is also re-proposing Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c) and proposing certain amendments to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) to address the applicability of external business conduct requirements to the U.S. business and foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers. The Commission also is proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR to apply the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of non-U.S. persons, or personnel of such non-U.S. persons' agents, that are located in the United States and to transactions effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility), along with certain related issues, including requiring registered broker-dealers (including registered security-based swap execution facilities) to report certain transactions that are effected by or through the registered broker-dealer., 58326=15 U.S. Code Ã‚Â§ 32, 33 - Repealed.

Regulation SCI will apply to certain self-regulatory organizations (including registered clearing agencies), alternative trading systems (Ã¢Â€ÂœATSsÃ¢Â€?), plan processors, and exempt clearing agencies (collectively, Ã¢Â€ÂœSCI entitiesÃ¢Â€?), and will require these SCI entities to comply with requirements with respect to the automated systems central to the performance of their regulated activities., 85636=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 (Ã¢Â€ÂœRuleÃ¢Â€?) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœActÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), which exempts certain brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national securities association (Ã¢Â€ÂœAssociationÃ¢Â€?). The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 168485=On February 25, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission re-opened the comment period on two releases related to asset-backed securities. The Commission re-opened the comment period to permit interested persons to comment on an approach for the dissemination of potentially sensitive asset-level data. The comment period is scheduled to end on March 28, 2014. In light of public interest in providing comment on the approach, the Commission is extending the comment period until April 28, 2014 to permit interested persons additional time to analyze and comment on the approach., 55164=The Securities and Exchange Commission published a document in the Federal Register of January 8, 2014 that contained an incorrect instruction. This correction is being published to correct instruction 5.b in that document., 29262=We are adopting significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure, and reporting for asset-backed securities (Ã¢Â€ÂœABSÃ¢Â€?). The final rules require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 (Ã¢Â€ÂœSecurities ActÃ¢Â€?) and ongoing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) of asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related assets, or backed by debt securities, including resecuritizations, contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information is required to be provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (Ã¢Â€ÂœXMLÃ¢Â€?). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria., 64600=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01, 8777=Pursuant to Section 763(i) of Title VII (Ã¢Â€ÂœTitle VIIÃ¢Â€?) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting new rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) governing the security-based swap data repository (Ã¢Â€ÂœSDRÃ¢Â€?) registration process, duties, and core principles. The Commission is also adopting a new registration form. Additionally, the Commission is amending several of its existing rules and regulations in order to accommodate SDRs. First, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T and Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that all filings by SDRs, including any confidential portion, and their requests for confidential treatment must be filed electronically. Second, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T by, among other things, adding a new rule that specifically applies to the electronic filing of SDRs' financial reports., 157993=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœClearing Supervision ActÃ¢Â€?), adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?). Among other things, the proposed rules would establish standards for the operation and governance of certain types of registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a Ã¢Â€Âœcovered clearing agency.Ã¢Â€?, 163009=In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), is proposing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (Ã¢Â€ÂœSBSDsÃ¢Â€?) and major security-based swap participants (Ã¢Â€ÂœMSBSPsÃ¢Â€?), securities count requirements applicable to certain SBSDs, and additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to broker-dealers to account for their security-based swap and swap activities. The Commission also is proposing an additional capital charge provision that would be added to the proposed capital rule for certain SBSDs. Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements., 102003=We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement Title V and Title VI of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the Ã¢Â€ÂœJOBS ActÃ¢Â€?). The proposed amendments would revise rules adopted under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) to reflect the new, higher thresholds for registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting that were set forth in the JOBS Act. The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for determining whether securities are Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? for purposes of registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g)., 44750=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting rules and providing guidance to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), to cross-border security-based swap activities. These rules and guidance in large part focus on the application of the Title VII definitions of Ã¢Â€Âœsecurity-based swap dealerÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœmajor security-based swap participantÃ¢Â€? in the cross-border context. The Commission also is adopting a procedural rule related to the submission of applications for substituted compliance. In addition, the Commission is adopting a rule addressing the scope of our authority, with respect to enforcement proceedings, under section 929P of the Dodd-Frank Act., 64192=124 Stat. 1376, 63800=Ã‚Â§ 1350 - Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports, 19073=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of September 15, 2014 (79 FR 55078). The rule applies to credit rating agencies registered with the Commission as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (Ã¢Â€ÂœNRSROsÃ¢Â€?), providers of third-party due diligence services for asset-backed securities, and issuers and underwriters of asset-backed securities. 1 1 See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 72936 (Aug. 27, 2014), 79 FR 55078 (Sep. 15, 2014)., 75167=We are proposing amendments to Item 402 of Regulation S-K to implement Section 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), as added by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?). Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant. The proposed disclosure would be required in proxy or information statements in which executive compensation disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K is required. The proposed disclosure requirements would not apply to emerging growth companies or foreign private issuers.}","Sat, 30 May 2015 23:48:50 GMT",{1039=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01.}

The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for determining whether securities are Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? for purposes of registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g)., 44750=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting rules and providing guidance to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), to cross-border security-based swap activities.

We add our INT value to our CHAR value and come up with the total (55), returned as an INT value. The database engine has implicitly converted the CHAR value to an INT value. The INT data type is used because INT takes precedence over CHAR. SQL Server is quite explicit when it comes to data type precedence. INT wins out over CHAR and VARCHAR every time. If a DATETIME value is tossed into the mix, it will beat out INT and just about all other types. (You can find details about precedence rules in the MSDN topic Ã¢Â€ÂœData Type Precedence.Ã¢Â€?) Returning to our example, SQL Server converts the CHAR value to INT and then proceeds to add the two integers together, giving us a result of 55.

In addition, when the variable is converted to an integer, it returns a value different from what it was assigned. Instead, it now equals the value stored in @stuff1. In many cases, you shouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t leave it up to the database engine to do your conversions, no matter how tempting that might be. In fact, some developers insist that all conversions should be explicit. At the very least, be sure that whenever the integrity of the data could be brought into question, error on the side of converting the data explicitly. Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™ve created a query that uses the ISNUMERIC function to verify whether a value is numeric and, if so, convert it to an integer.

The ISNUMERIC function can be a slippery one. On the surface, its purpose appears only to determine whether the submitted value is indeed a valid numeric type. But looks can be deceiving.

We add our INT value to our CHAR value and come up with the total (55), returned as an INT value. The database engine has implicitly converted the CHAR value to an INT value. The INT data type is used because INT takes precedence over CHAR. SQL Server is quite explicit when it comes to data type precedence. INT wins out over CHAR and VARCHAR every time. If a DATETIME value is tossed into the mix, it will beat out INT and just about all other types. (You can find details about precedence rules in the MSDN topic Ã¢Â€ÂœData Type Precedence.Ã¢Â€?) Returning to our example, SQL Server converts the CHAR value to INT and then proceeds to add the two integers together, giving us a result of 55.
