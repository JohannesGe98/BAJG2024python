Although they do offer scholarships, the cost to attend the university is significant. I do believe that it is a wonderful institution, but I'm not sure if the cost is necessary--I feel like it puts a burden on many students. Am enjoying being here Whitworth has a great atmosphere and a welcoming community. Events are always occurring on-campus to provide students with a study break or a chance to hang out with others. Primetime, which happens from 8-11 every night, is put on by the RA's in every dorm to give students an option to have fun for a little while. Some of the Primetimes in my dorm this past semester included baking, Candy Corn Olympics, Sleeping Bag Wrestling, board games, and many others. The people at Whitworth are very friendly, and everyone cares for each other. Overall, the community and the campus itself makes Whitworth an amazing school. Am learning a lot Whitworth has great academics--the classes are rigorous, and the class sizes are small enough for students to get the help they need from their professors. All classes integrate faith and learning, and my classes so far have been hard but definitely worthwhile. The CORE classes are required for all",True,0,0

The whole campus is small, enclosed by beautiful pine trees, well-lit and well-patrolled by campus security. You can call security at any time if you want them to walk you to your dorm, but this is rarely necessary because virtually no dangerous situations come up on campus. Everyone gets that feeling that they are right at home there.', 'None - We love dorm community!', ""Whitworth is a compartitively smaller school and does have a good amount of activities and certainly plenty of things to keep the students busy (most often too busy), but it can't truly compete with larger Universities and state schools that offer tremendous variety in sports, extracurriculars, clubs etc. Whitworth doesn't have a tai chi club or a mime group, but despite that, I think most people will find an activity they enjoy and want to be involved in. In all honestly, I spent most of my time in pursuit of academics and working so I didn't even have time to go after extra groups. If you are looking for activities centered around helping others though, Whitworth has a ton! For example, on Saturdays there is a group called En Christo that makes sack meals for the homeless and takes them downtown every week to hand out. There are so many groups similar to that and they prepare the students to work in non-profit agencies."", 'This school is ideal for the student that is seeking truth in this world and has the desire to make global impact. Whitworth is a Christian College that is not afraid to ask the hard questions and yet still remains utterly faithful and dedicated to following God and serving humanity. Whitworth explores the concept of worldview and has incredible grace and understanding for how other people may see the world differently and explores why they see it differently. With that, students are challenged to determine why they have their own views and by the end, many students find that their faith has grown not from being protected in a safe little bubble, but rather their faith has been sharpened by being tested and proven of worth. The incredible thing is that Whitworth is also a wonderful school for atheists and people of all different faiths and the reason for this is that the university had a focus once again on grace and understanding. I have a very dear friend who is an atheist and graduated from Whitworth and she loved her time there and loved her school. It was a safe place for her and she grew in incredible ways despite her rejection of religion. As long as a student wants to grow and wants to be engaged in their learning environment, Whitworth is a near perfect school.', 'At Whitworth we have something called The Little Three. These are essentially 3 things you have to accomplish before you graduate: 1) You need to catch a virgin pine cone (This is a pinecone that has fallen from a tree and not yet hit the ground. WARNING: Pine cones are spiny. I got my pine cone but not without a few battle wounds!) 2) You need to drop your lunch tray in the cafeteria (the coolest part is, every time this happens, the entire room claps and cheers for you - embarrassing moment over) 3) You need to get your ring before spring (What this is really referring to is the tendency for students at small Christian Liberal Arts Colleges to get hitched or engaged before graduation. There has been some protest against this item of the little 3 but we keep it on there for kicks and giggles ;)', ""The school is expensive but Whitworth does a great job at awarding scholarships and really helping out those who cannot afford it on their own. One of my closest friends actually received a full ride based on merit. Another friend had it almost entirely paid for because she came from a low-income family. I was incredibly blessed to have a generous family who helped me but with that, I also got almost half of my schooling paid for by the University just for my grades and achievements. They want you to be at Whitworth and I think for most people, it is possible to make it happen. Ultimately too, you cannot put a price on the quality of education you get there because it's about so much more that just head knowledge. You come out changed for the good and empowered to impact the world."", ""There is so much to do for fun! Try the Pleasant Blends coffee shop down the street for some amazing Chai Tea. Pop into a prime time at any dorm on a given night. Join the swing dancing club that meets on Saturdays and learn to dance. Some of the best fun I ever had at Whitworth though was going to the improv team shows that took place once a month. I don't ever think I laughed so hard I peed my pants until those nights. It's just that funny!"", ""Whitworth has done quite a bit to improve the food over the time that I was there. They even built a new dining hall and opened up with dozens more food choices and options based on comments made by the students. I give them all the credit in the world for responding to the suggestions. However, I am a very healthy eater as well as gluten-intolerant and with this comes a sensitivity to the quality and hidden content of food that most people wouldn't have. Over time, I came to not enjoy the food quite as much because I felt there were limited options for myself, but I can see how I am definitely the exception to the rule."", ""Whitworth has what they call Prime Time. Each night in the dorms, the R.A.'s put on a game or activity that anyone is able to participate in. Let me tell you, it was so fun! We did everything from Disney movie marathons, to prison tattoos with Crayola markers to marshmallow blow gun wars to fort building. It was like being a kid again each and every day and it was the perfect way to build meaningful relationships with the other students in the dorm. I made some of my best friends during those times. With that, every R.A. I ever had was just a wonderful person. Whitworth goes through a highly selective process to find the R.A.'s and in the end, I have always found them to be people of excellent character. Several times they were there for me just to listen or help out. With that, they were amazing at building hall camaraderie. I can tell you one thing, you will always feel safe and cared for in the dorms at Whitworth, and you might just get pelted with a marshmallow to the face while you are at it!"", 'During my time at Whitworth, I maintained a 4.0 GPA all the way to graduation. I have always been a good student and extremely disciplined, and getting good grades is entirely possible, but let me tell you, it was very challenging. I had to give it my all and choose to study even when no one else was. I had to choose to fight for my GPA and make it a priority. It was worth it though and I received so much help and encouragement fro my professors along the way. If I needed support, I quickly and easily had it. I never felt frustrated or along in the pursuit of academic excellence. The classes were hard, but every test every lecture was so fair and I felt that if I tried hard enough, I was always able to succeed.', ""1) When you go to Whitworth, don't just go to get a degree and certainly don't have the get in, get out mentality.
