Some of the services and offerings are maybe not so inspired. It falls to about average after you run into some of the shortcomings.', ""Going to town can be fun, but the buses usually aren't exactly speedy so don't plan on any quick trips. Other than that, you have a whole forest to explore, and can usually find plenty of privacy, so have at it. There are some spots you'll learn about early on that most people go to, but don't limit yourself."", 'Typical dining hall food. I heard otherwise before attending the university, but it just about average here at College 8.

Obviously, as with any school, there are many what if's when it comes to dorm life. Roommates, RA's, and room situations are not things I can comment on.However, I have noticed a generally positive atmosphere at College 8: I live in a quad(which is a great choice for those looking to save some money and don't minding living with 3 other people. With my roommates at least, the extra space is more than worth it.) and have not run into any problems. While it can be very boring at times, and access to downtown is limited, and may not be the typical college experience, it is definitely fun and easy going. I am lucky enough to have an awesome RA however, some may not be so lucky. One note: Colleges are spread out across the campus, so much so that often it will not be appealing to make the trip to another college, be warned."", 'So far in my academic experience here, I have noticed highly varying degrees of difficulty. Some classes require constant devotion and a rigorous work ethic, while others are much more similar to High school in terms of difficulty. Regardless, thanks to the schools location and goals, there are many interesting classes to take.', ""This is definitely a place of ideas, liberal and environmentally conscious individuals, and a constant passion for gaining knowledge and inspiring those around you.

Beginning by the totem pole at Porter College, students gather together in the nude and run throughout campus. In the rain. Naked. While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April.

The availability of food is as good as the quality., 179234=The First Rain Run is a run that occurs on the first day of the year that it rains the entire day and is still raining at nighttime. It begins at Porter College and runs a loop around the school. Everyone runs naked, though a small handful only partially naked. The run ends in a drum circle in the Porter Meadow, though the end is even less official and tends to end however the runners end up wanting it to. Tree Nine is a massive tree above College Nine with many branches that many students climb their first year at UC Santa Cruz. It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student. April 20th, or 4/20 is, as you probably know, a nationwide and possibly worldwide event that is specifically for smoking marijuana, at 4:20 on the dot, though not everyone follows that rule. One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day.

There are a few duds, but you'll find that at any school. Tuition was increased for the 2009-2010 school year, but where in the country hasn't college tuition gone up, with the way the economy is? The only thing that I don't like is that a lot of classes are hard to get into as a first or second year because enrollment times are issued by the number of credits you have.

The cafes and restaurants on campus serve great food and are in great prices."", 'The dorms and apartments are very expensive on campus and some of the housing are old. The people living in the dorms are very friendly and outgoing and also you have options in what type of dorm life you would like to live in.', 'The classes here start out pretty easy, but at the end they become very difficult. I recommend going to all of the class discussion sections and all of the teachers office hours to have answers questioned. The students here are all pushed to do some type of research and gain experience in work.', 'I recommend prospective students to be prepared for the quick quarter system. The quarter system flies by very fast. It is only 10 weeks and this makes it great because you quickly finish classes and move on to the next on. Prospective students should not also under estimate classes and should keep up with their assigned readings before each class.', 'University of California, Santa Cruz is a great place to learn and make new friends.

Some may complain about climbing the hills to classes, but it's well worth it. Where else can you go to class in the middle of a redwood forest, or wake up to a panoramic view of Monterrey Bay. If you end up at UCSC, be sure to visit Pogonip - the state park that is literally next-door to the campus. Not a huge party school, if that's what you're looking for, but weekends aren't boring either. There's plenty to do down town, and of course, at the beach. Am learning a lot After completing my first year at UCSC - and most of my GEs - I feel that I have learned a lot in many different areas of study. The classes offered as general education requirements are both interesting and informative. I have only taken two of my major prerequisites thus far, but both have also exceeded my expectations in the amount I learned from them.

Tuition is to raise 5% each year after 2014., 665594=If interested in attending this institution, I would advise you to do good in your school. You do not have to be involved in something for your community or play any sports. I graduated the school with a GPA of 3.7 and SAT score of around 1400 and was able to get in.

Beginning by the totem pole at Porter College, students gather together in the nude and run throughout campus. In the rain. Naked. While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April.

Active students are at an advantage; the campus terrain is hilly and vast. But, if you're not yet prepared for that, don't worry. In a few days, your legs will be sore, and, in a few more, they will have adjusted to the new environment. Most students at Santa Cruz are very liberal (as well as most teachers) and are activists for what they believe in. Everyone has a place here, though.

Although we live in a beautiful campus, there is a lot of walking to do from place to place so one must be ready for that. Also, do not procrastinate. Because we are on the quarter system, everything is extremely fast paced so missing out on one lecture or not doing a particular homework assignment could be the dividing factor between a passing and non-passing grade. Also, remember to branch out and have fun. College is a once in a lifetime experience so along with working hard, remember to meet new people and try out for clubs or other extra curricular activities to help you spread your wings and meet the people whom you can call your lifetime friends and family.', 'UCSC is just like home.

Tuition is to raise 5% each year after 2014., 665594=If interested in attending this institution, I would advise you to do good in your school. You do not have to be involved in something for your community or play any sports. I graduated the school with a GPA of 3.7 and SAT score of around 1400 and was able to get in. In other words if you are good at your academics, you are good to go., 342802=April 20th will show you the true hippie tradition of UCSC. Porter Hill is packed with pot-smoking students and locals alike., 789213=It was rated #1 in vegan food I think in 2011 which a plus to me because Im a vegetarian so they do have a lot of options compared to others schools. Usually has a good variety of healthly food and unheathly food. But they start to serve the same stuff and it gets old., 788670=Go to Natural Bridges ! Beautiful beach Use a rent a car or a zip car to go on road trips Hiking on beautiful trails Take a trip or class through OPERS Downtown - restaurants, shops and the Del Mar is a cool movie theater Dances on campus or off campus, 864444=I felt safe on campus, the only incidents that occurred in the academic school year 2012-13 were in town., 1043323=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 192333=This year (2013-2014), we do not have guards at the entrances of campus anymore so almost anyone can set foot on campus, however we do have CSO's and escort systems if you're feeling unsafe at night., 491042=First Rain, or the Naked Run, occurs during the first rainfall of the school year. Beginning by the totem pole at Porter College, students gather together in the nude and run throughout campus. In the rain. Naked. While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April. Drum circles abound. A police force is present, though, they are mostly there to ensure that people stay safe., 21156=Every year at the first rain, thousands of students begin from the east side of campus and run naked to the west side of campus, ending in the OPERS pool. There are often full moon drum circles at the Porter Meadows as well. April 20th brings thousands of students and non-affiliates to the Porter Meadows for the day and has fun student-run activities such as slacklining competitions. The Rock Garden and the Garden of Eden are seemingly magical places in Pogonip that gathers nature loving students frequently (if you can find them). The amphitheater by the bookstore is also a really cool place. There are tons of secret places around campus that people have found and there are plenty more to be discovered since the campus is located inside a forest., 551777=Besides the rain run that started in the fall and the 4/20 event that happen as well as the protest on May, no nothing out of the ordinary., 705370=in 2011 UCSC won the best Vegan food on a college campus. The food is good for omnivores too. There is a wide variety of dining locations on campus, 5 dining halls and specialty restaurants on campus. With your housing you will have the option of selecting a 7 day unlimited food plan, which means you can enter and eat at any hall as much as you want and whenever you want. The availability of food is as good as the quality., 179234=The First Rain Run is a run that occurs on the first day of the year that it rains the entire day and is still raining at nighttime. It begins at Porter College and runs a loop around the school. Everyone runs naked, though a small handful only partially naked. The run ends in a drum circle in the Porter Meadow, though the end is even less official and tends to end however the runners end up wanting it to. Tree Nine is a massive tree above College Nine with many branches that many students climb their first year at UC Santa Cruz. It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student. April 20th, or 4/20 is, as you probably know, a nationwide and possibly worldwide event that is specifically for smoking marijuana, at 4:20 on the dot, though not everyone follows that rule. One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day. Drum circles happen in the various meadows at Santa Cruz, especially at the full moon. Everyone gets together to dance, play music, and be with friends., 67768=UC Santa Cruz is not only a great place to learn and succeed in a higher education, but also a great place to live. In fact, Santa Cruz was voted best campus for it's cleanliness. surrounded by trees, trees, and more trees the campus is nice and shady on warm sunny days and throughout the whole year great weather. May i add that the beach is within a 5-10 minute drive. If you are someone who loves nature Santa Cruz is right for you. i know it was for me. i love the hills and the trees in Santa Cruz., 614046=1) Tango lessons at the Palomar 2) Natural Bridges Beach 3) Seabright Beach 4 ) Trivia night at Woodstocks, 981671=UCSC had the honor of placing first place in PETA's Most Vegan Friendly College in 2011. The dining halls try something new at least once a week, always finding new ways of mixing up the menu., 5140=The professors are amazingly brilliant, and most teach with excellent clarity and enthusiasm. There are a few duds, but you'll find that at any school. Tuition was increased for the 2009-2010 school year, but where in the country hasn't college tuition gone up, with the way the economy is? The only thing that I don't like is that a lot of classes are hard to get into as a first or second year because enrollment times are issued by the number of credits you have. It is disappointing to try to sign up for a class numerous quarters in a row, and still not get in because the class closes before your enrollment time rolls around.}","06/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 46 out of 47 people found this review useful. 1 of 217 Mary from Carmichael, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

For vegetarians I found there aren't many great tasty options, on occasion I'd be surprised to find good food (stick to the salad bar!) For meat eaters there a wide array of meat, burgers etc. Usually I'd make the trek to Merrill dining hall which has more vegetarian friendly options. Another good dinning hall would be Cowell/Stevenson dining hall, more variety if you happen to be lactose intolerant like me. Again it's a big school and has to make large quantities of food so it makes sense the food might not be so good."", ""Dorms at Santa Cruz are nestled into the natural environment. You'll find you'll get close to floor mates, living in dorms makes it easy to make friends. Sadly the restrooms aren't as private as you'd like and depending on the cleanliness of your neighbors you may find some surprises in the shower. Wi-fi also tends to be very spotty in the dorms, you'll have to get a router for better internet access."", ""Academic rigor depends on the classes you take, taking a chemistry class will be more rigorous than say an english class. However professors expect a lot, you'll find yourself working hard especially when your crunched for time on the quarter system."", ""Make sure to research beforehand, Santa Cruz is a great institution but if you have a wide range of ideas for a major you may find yourself having to transfer later on. If you attend Santa Cruz make sure to take advantage of resources like tutoring etc. after all you are paying for it! Most importantly visit the school! I had friends leave because they we're coming from a large city to a smaller town and didn't like the change."", ""At UC Santa Cruz you'll find a beautiful campus, with many students that work together to achieve their academic goals.

Some may complain about climbing the hills to classes, but it's well worth it. Where else can you go to class in the middle of a redwood forest, or wake up to a panoramic view of Monterrey Bay. If you end up at UCSC, be sure to visit Pogonip - the state park that is literally next-door to the campus. Not a huge party school, if that's what you're looking for, but weekends aren't boring either. There's plenty to do down town, and of course, at the beach. Am learning a lot After completing my first year at UCSC - and most of my GEs - I feel that I have learned a lot in many different areas of study. The classes offered as general education requirements are both interesting and informative. I have only taken two of my major prerequisites thus far, but both have also exceeded my expectations in the amount I learned from them.

While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April.

It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student.

One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day.

Some may complain about climbing the hills to classes, but it's well worth it. Where else can you go to class in the middle of a redwood forest, or wake up to a panoramic view of Monterrey Bay. If you end up at UCSC, be sure to visit Pogonip - the state park that is literally next-door to the campus. Not a huge party school, if that's what you're looking for, but weekends aren't boring either. There's plenty to do down town, and of course, at the beach. Am learning a lot After completing my first year at UCSC - and most of my GEs - I feel that I have learned a lot in many different areas of study. The classes offered as general education requirements are both interesting and informative. I have only taken two of my major prerequisites thus far, but both have also exceeded my expectations in the amount I learned from them.

While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April.

The availability of food is as good as the quality., 179234=The First Rain Run is a run that occurs on the first day of the year that it rains the entire day and is still raining at nighttime. It begins at Porter College and runs a loop around the school. Everyone runs naked, though a small handful only partially naked. The run ends in a drum circle in the Porter Meadow, though the end is even less official and tends to end however the runners end up wanting it to. Tree Nine is a massive tree above College Nine with many branches that many students climb their first year at UC Santa Cruz. It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student. April 20th, or 4/20 is, as you probably know, a nationwide and possibly worldwide event that is specifically for smoking marijuana, at 4:20 on the dot, though not everyone follows that rule. One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day.

Get involved with groups on campus, whether it be intramural sports, clubs, or sororities/fraternities.

One very important thing to consider about attending UCSC is the tuition rate. Tuition is to raise 5% each year after 2014., 665594=If interested in attending this institution, I would advise you to do good in your school. You do not have to be involved in something for your community or play any sports. I graduated the school with a GPA of 3.7 and SAT score of around 1400 and was able to get in. In other words if you are good at your academics, you are good to go., 342802=April 20th will show you the true hippie tradition of UCSC. Porter Hill is packed with pot-smoking students and locals alike., 789213=It was rated #1 in vegan food I think in 2011 which a plus to me because Im a vegetarian so they do have a lot of options compared to others schools. Usually has a good variety of healthly food and unheathly food. But they start to serve the same stuff and it gets old., 788670=Go to Natural Bridges ! Beautiful beach Use a rent a car or a zip car to go on road trips Hiking on beautiful trails Take a trip or class through OPERS Downtown - restaurants, shops and the Del Mar is a cool movie theater Dances on campus or off campus, 864444=I felt safe on campus, the only incidents that occurred in the academic school year 2012-13 were in town., 1043323=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 192333=This year (2013-2014), we do not have guards at the entrances of campus anymore so almost anyone can set foot on campus, however we do have CSO's and escort systems if you're feeling unsafe at night., 491042=First Rain, or the Naked Run, occurs during the first rainfall of the school year. Beginning by the totem pole at Porter College, students gather together in the nude and run throughout campus. In the rain. Naked. While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April. Drum circles abound. A police force is present, though, they are mostly there to ensure that people stay safe., 21156=Every year at the first rain, thousands of students begin from the east side of campus and run naked to the west side of campus, ending in the OPERS pool. There are often full moon drum circles at the Porter Meadows as well. April 20th brings thousands of students and non-affiliates to the Porter Meadows for the day and has fun student-run activities such as slacklining competitions. The Rock Garden and the Garden of Eden are seemingly magical places in Pogonip that gathers nature loving students frequently (if you can find them). The amphitheater by the bookstore is also a really cool place. There are tons of secret places around campus that people have found and there are plenty more to be discovered since the campus is located inside a forest., 551777=Besides the rain run that started in the fall and the 4/20 event that happen as well as the protest on May, no nothing out of the ordinary., 705370=in 2011 UCSC won the best Vegan food on a college campus. The food is good for omnivores too. There is a wide variety of dining locations on campus, 5 dining halls and specialty restaurants on campus. With your housing you will have the option of selecting a 7 day unlimited food plan, which means you can enter and eat at any hall as much as you want and whenever you want. The availability of food is as good as the quality., 179234=The First Rain Run is a run that occurs on the first day of the year that it rains the entire day and is still raining at nighttime. It begins at Porter College and runs a loop around the school. Everyone runs naked, though a small handful only partially naked. The run ends in a drum circle in the Porter Meadow, though the end is even less official and tends to end however the runners end up wanting it to. Tree Nine is a massive tree above College Nine with many branches that many students climb their first year at UC Santa Cruz. It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student. April 20th, or 4/20 is, as you probably know, a nationwide and possibly worldwide event that is specifically for smoking marijuana, at 4:20 on the dot, though not everyone follows that rule. One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day.

When the weather's nice we like to car pool down to the sand and set up the corn holes and play soccer by the ocean. There are also various events going on every week, and bonfires occur often on campus when the weather allows. However, the area around campus isn't too student-orientated, and the only things to do off campus are going to the movies or bowling, unless you want to make the thirty-minute drive to Hilton Head Island or Savannah."", ""The cafeteria on USCB is nice, well-lit and always has enough seats. They always have three separate meal options daily, however they do tend to serve a limited variety of foods such as hamburgers, chicken tenders, and pizza. The hours are wonderful, and the staff is lovely. Another drawback, however, is that the cafeteria isn't open on weekends, and a car is necessary if you want to go get any fast food considering the area around campus isn't student-friendly."", ""The dorms at USCB are very nice, and you get the bang for your buck. All dorms have a full kitchen and laundry set-up, and are nicely sized. The staff in the Housing Department are very kind and helpful, and will go above and beyond to welcome each student. The only inconveniences are that we don't get mail on the weekends and the visitor regulations are a bit strict, but other than that Housing on campus is wonderful!"", 'The classes USCB offers range in difficulty, but each course is individually-rewarding and intriguing. Some classes require a lot of studying and much writing of the fated college papers, while others just require your attendance and participation.', ""USCB is for students of all varieties- whether you are undecided, wanting to transfer to a bigger school, or ready to start your adult life.

I know Madison has a reputation as a party school, and it is very true that if you like to party this is sure to be a fun place for you. On the other hand (from personal experience) I can guarantee that if you are not into partying, or if you don't drink, you don't have to worry. There is so much other stuff to do you can still have an amazing experience here."", ""The school is large, but that doesn't mean that you have to feel overwhelmed here. When you break down all the academic programs you will most likely end up in a relatively small group of students. Go to the activities fair and find something to get involved with, but DO NOT take on too much. Choose one or two extra-curricular activities at one time. Freshman year is very hard for many students and often grades will show this. It will help you to have a couple of outlets to have some fun, but it will hurt you if you never have time to study. On that note - make sure you are studying and doing your work everyday. Procrastinating may get you by in high school but for the vast majority of people it doesn't work like that at Madison."", 'To be honest Madison is not the cheepest school to attend. You will get hit with costs that some may not immediately consider. Tuition, room, and board are not your only costs. Students do have to pay for tickets into sports games (this is different for many other universities), and if you want to bring a car to campus you will add a considerable amount to your yearly costs. All this considered I still think that the superior academic instruction you will recieve, the free entertainment that is offered, and the overall Madison experience make it 100% worth the costs.', ""I love this school and this city. There is almost always something going on. The Union has movies and music among other events, and state street is always fun to walk down. I always have a ton of fun going to Badger games - everyone has tons of school spirit so even if you don't enjoy the sport in itself you are bound to have fun."", 'I can honestly say that every class I have taken here has been worthwhile. Even going beyond the information that I have learned in classes I have learned better study strategies. Every professor I have had has been extremely nice and willing to help, but I will add the qualifier that because the school is so large you must be willing to put personal effort forth if you need help from your professors or Teaching Assistants.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

I'm not saying you have to be captain of the lacrosse team, but be an active contributor to the lacrosse team! Leadership skills will not only help you succeed at UW, but in life as well so it is best to start early! Study! Develop those study skills early because believe me Madison is not like high school anymore. Get to know your teachers so you can establish a relationship with them (you do need a strong letter of recommendation). Visit Madison! Make sure you see it. Most kids will write it off as a huge school taught by TAs that only cares about their grad students. This is far from true. As someone who easily gets lost, it's not as bad as it looks. If you visit, be sure to attend a class! Most lectures are rather large and it is easy to sneak in and see the academic atmosphere."", ""No university is cheap. Or at least, the ones worth going to aren't. I am a resident from Wisconsin so I am a little biased. If you are out of state though, still consider the school. Many scholarship and financial aid packages are available. I know many who get most of their tuition paid for each year. What are you paying for? Top teachers who all have graduated from excellent schools with PH D's in their respective fields. You'll be surprised that your professors will often be cited in your textbooks! You are also paying for research in each subject so once again I highly recommend getting involved! Housing is also included in their estimate which is a fair amount for the quality of the room. But their are many other less expensive options for housing if you want to explore those as well!"", ""Madison is more than just a good school with a strong emphasis on research. It is a place to have fun and enjoy many life experiences. Nothing quite compares to doing the Jump Around after the third quarter of a Badger Game in a sea of red and white (try not to lose your balance!!) There are numerous activities to get involved in and plenty of opportunities to meet new people. There are also plenty of free events at Memorial Union to attend if you are unfortunate enough not to get tickets to the numerous Badger athletic events. It pretty much can be anything you want it to be. If you want to spend your time droning at College Library, fine. But it's not all about doing homework. There is balance that must be had and the University of Wisconsin recognizes this. I love it here!"", 'I went into the University of Wisconsin overtly confident that I was going to breeze through and be on my way to UCLA medical school. This university has challenged me more than I ever would have expected. Almost in every major offered Madison recognized as one of the top programs in the country. Still overconfident? UW offers many honors programs. For example, I am currently enrolled in the Biology Core Curriculum program, a four semester researched based advanced biology program. It gives you opportunities to work one on one with professors, a rarity at most large schools. Programs like these are offered throughout each major. If you are finding yourself having troubles, there are many people available to help you. Professors are all required to have open office hours and will usually meet with you outside of them if you ask. Graduate TAs are often excellent resources as well. Also, most libraries have tutoring programs in a variety of subjects. If you are interested in getting more involved in your learning, join a research lab! Each program conducts research and many welcome undergrads. It is a great way to get to know leading researchers in the field and looks great on a resume.

For example, all students are entitled to a free bus pass for the Madison Metro bus system. These buses can take you to the mall, grocery store, or even some of your classes, free of charge. The University Health Services also offers free check ups and some immunizations, that can really help save you money. Although housing in Madison is steeply priced to begin with, deals can be found through the local leasing agencies on apartments and houses. I recommend living in the dorm your freshman year, which is a little pricey but well worth the experience. However, after that you can get more affordable housing if you search hard enough."", ""Madison is an awesome city to live in. There is something for everyone, no matter what you like to do in your spare time. If you're more into the party scene, the southwest dorms are a great way to meet people your freshman year, and are centered right in the heart of campus. If you'd rather have a more laid back residence, the lakeshore dorms provide beautiful scenery and the lakeshore trail for walking and running. The campus also offers many things to do. There are free movies at the union, game nights in the dorms, and american idol-like competitions to take part in. Another perk is that State Street and many other places to hang out are within walking distance from campus. Having a car is not necessary, and to be blunt, designated drivers are not needed, making the party scene safer for students."", 'The University of Wisconsin-Madison has multiple courses for anything your looking to learn. From Badminton to Molecular Biology, there are classes for everyone. However, this college is definitely only for the serious student. Large class sizes make some lectures difficult to follow. This is made up for by recitation sessions, where students meet with a teaching assistant to go over material covered in lecture. The hardest thing about the transition to college is learning how to study. If you can understand this, I can guarantee you will learn a lot. Listen to your teaching assistants. They have been there a while and have gone through the same kind of transition. Its their job to help you. If you take advantage of the resources available to you, you will have no trouble learning and enjoying the course material.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,12,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

You won't regret it."", 'Unless you are bringing your car to college you are somewhat restricted on the activities you can do but there are tons of fun things to do around campus. Get to know the bus system and the opportunities open up. Most people will say for fun you could go to a party, which is true but the city of Madison has so much more to offer. There are movie theaters in the Unions, there are a few museums close by, the lake is great in the summer, there is a bowling alley with rock climbing in Union south. Many great authors, poets, and artists come to speak on campus. Last year President Obama came twice and even the Dalai Lama came to speak. The Capitol is a short walk from campus and during the warm months the farmers market takes over Capitol Square. If you are still looking for something to do then join one of the many great student clubs, orgs, or even Greek life. I joined Cheerleading and it was one of the best choices I made. I got to continue something I loved in high school and I met so many new people in the club.', 'When it comes to the dining halls. . . you get what you pay for. My freshman year in the dorms was the first year the new Gordons Dining and Event Center opened and it was so convenient being right across the street from my dorm. The food at first seems great but after awhile you get sick of the same options everyday. There is only so much quality that can go into food made to feed 4,000 students three times a day. Also beware. . . the freshman 15 is a real thing. . . a very scary real thing. There are healthier options but they do tend to be a little more expensive. If you are willing to spend some extra cash there are so many great restaurants all around campus, especially on State Street.', 'First off, dorm life is a right of passage. It is the epitome of the college experience. Everyone that I know who chose a different route regrets it. Living in the dorms can be stressful and annoying sometimes but it is one of the best life experiences you will ever have. The people you meet are amazing and yes there are those people that you will just not get along with (hopefully it is not your roommate) but these people will be the friend you have for a lifetime. I had the lovely opportunity of not only living in the most documented dorm but also on the most documented floor so dorm life was never dull or boring. Partying and drinking happens a lot. Thursday night through Saturday night is filled with loud music, drunk students stumbling down the halls, and occasionally puke in front of the elevators. Even though a lot of partying goes on it will surprise you how studious people can really be, but then again we do go to Madison and it is pretty hard. If the dorms get to loud for you there are so many great campus building that are perfect for studying: the SAC (student activity center), the libraries, the unions, and even non-campus buildings life a coffee shop on State Street. You will find one building that becomes your study spot. Now I lived in a party dorm so I cannoÃƒ\x82?t speak for the experience in Lakeshore. Those dorms are known as more studious and no one really parties but I can guarantee that drinking still does occur just not to the same extent as Southeast. Now my dorm was older and the rooms were small but I would not trade it in a million years for one of the newer luxurious dorms. I am going to miss living in the dorms because when else will you be able to live on a floor with 72 of your closets friends? But I am so excited for my first apartment. Living in the dorms is a humbling experience and makes you appreciate everything a little bit more, like a bigger bed, a bigger closet, privacy, not wearing shoes in the shower. I loved dorm life but I cannot speak for everyone, I know some people absolutely hate it. You just have to make that decision for yourself.', 'Before you even start your classes you will have to do homework, and that homework is researching courses and professors. You could have the same course as someone else but the professor can make all the difference. Make sure you use you professors along with your TAs and fellow classmates because they will be your best resources for success. Coming from a top high school and having a great ACT/SAT score with a high GPA I was a little shocked at how hard Madison actually was. I came in thinking it is just some state school with a party reputation and I would pass by with flying colors but then reality hit. I failed my first midterm and eventually had to drop the class. This opened my eyes and I saw that I needed to change the way I was studying and planning my days. It is important to have fun and relax but Madison is a hard school and studying comes along with that.', 'If you are thinking about coming to UW-Madison then DO IT. This university will offer you everything you need to succeed. If you are having doubts then just come visit and see if it is the right fit for you. Madison may seem like a fun party school but remember it is nationally ranked, so studying comes along with the partying.', 'The University of Wisconsin Madison was not my first choice, in fact it was my last choice but I am glad I came here because I have grown to love it. It provides a student with everything, good academics, great sports, fun parties, and so much more. Madison has become a part of me and provided me with so much, the atmosphere, the people, the city, and the opportunities will not disappoint you.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,27,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

I am a Wisconsin resident, and I pay in-state tuition. However, for students from out of state, this could be pricey. The out of state tuition is still cheaper than many private institutions, and many scholarships are available for people from other areas. Truthfully, there are many scholarships available for any student as long as he or she is willing to search and apply.', 'When I graduated high school, I really wanted to go far away for college. Because I grew up in Madison, I wanted to venture out to other places. After spending the semester on the east coast, I realized that the people in the Midwest tend to be more welcoming and friendly than people from other regions. When I returned, I noticed that there are many more things to do on campus since it is in the heart of Madison, not on the outskirts of the city. No matter where you stay on campus, you can walk to main shopping areas, restaurants and bars, movies, museums, and events on the square. I would highly recommend attending some of the sporting events; all of the athletic teams are very successful. The fans and student section give the team great support and provide an exciting atmosphere.', 'I originally went to Boston College, hoping that a private school would help me achieve a great education, but I was unimpressed. I found myself bored and resorted to daydreaming through all of my classes. I transferred to UW Madison since I was unhappy with my experience out east. So far, all of my classes at the UW have been intruiging and challenging, including the subjects I did not particularly enjoy during high school. The professors are fantastic, and the TAs that run discussions and other sections that supplement the lectures are more helpful than I could have imagined.

And for those students who enjoy the nightlife, they will have ample opportunities for parties.', 'There are plenty of places to eat on campus, and there is usually always somewhere open when a snack is needed.

There's a reason employers are impressed when they see that you got your degree at UW - they know that you know your stuff. And, for those of you who are afraid you'll spend every night at the library? No worries - we Badgers still manage to find plenty of time for fun."", ""For any new students, make sure to take a stroll around the student organization fair (held at the beginning of each semester).

There are escort services for night-time walks from the library, and key card locks on all of the dorms. There are emergency call booths around campus with fast responses. In addition, city police are always present at bigger events such as Halloween and security in the dorms is increased.', 'There are many different Greek organizations present at UW-Madison. There are both social and professional groups. The professional groups are a great way to get to know the staff and create a life-long network within your discipline.', 'Clubs and Activities at UW-Madison are truly fantastic and so I give them a 5/5. They have all sorts of activities for every type of person from cheese club to belly dance, from Russian club to gamer club and from volunteer clubs to inter-mural, club and varsity sports. They have a big event where hundreds of clubs have booths at the Kohl Center at the beginning of the year and it is very easy to get involved.', 'UW-Madison is a great school for motivated and independent people. It is a school full of opportunities for those who are not afraid to seek them.', 'There is a gigantic snowball fight in the middle of campus every year as soon as snow permits, and the bell tower has a concert everyday around 1pm and plays all sorts different songs.', 'The university is large and therefore somewhat expensive, but there are almost limitless opportunities if you just seek them out. Whether its research, internships or co-ops with the university or local industries, or government involvement and volunteerism. In addition, the university provides health services, fitness services and many events that are paid for by tuition. All of these services are great to make having fun and staying healthy easy while you are at school.', 'The downtown area is very fun. There are museums, theaters, and farmers markets. There are concerts for everyone from classical to pop and from local bands to big names. There are plenty of restaurants and shops downtown and a few big malls only a bus ride away. In addition there are sports year round including hockey, basketball and of course badger Football. Not to mention the gorgeous lakes and trails that surround the campus.', 'The food is very affordable the dining halls for dorm residents, but expensive for non-dorm residents. There are many campus-run cafes and restaurants all around campus that are great for lunch and for the most part affordable. The food has a good mix of healthy and unhealthy options. Most of the dairy products are made on campus and the ice cream is excellent. There are many different options from many corners of the world off campus as well. Over all the food is great if you know where to look this is why the Food at UW-Madison receives a 3/5.', 'There are many different options for housing at UW-Madison. They have quiet and loud neighborhoods and different levels of amenities. The cheapest rooms are still expensive and the dorms are cramped, but the experience is valuable. Having a community to come home to and an older House Fellow to advise you and help you adjust are very important. This is why I give dorm life a 4/5.', 'The University of Wisconsin-Madison is academically very strong. There are easier classes, but there are honors programs and classes to really stretch your abilities. There are entry level classes to get you up to speed in weaker areas and plenty of ways to earn credit for things you already know. In addition there are many different options for any remaining general credits. The higher level classes are challenging but very rewarding so I give Madison a 4/5.', 'The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a very large university, but it can be made much smaller by seeking organizations that speak to you. Living the dorms may be cramped and a little crazy, but the activities put on by the hall and the resident adviser (House Fellow) that lives on your floor can really help you adjust to the city and college life in general. UW-Madison is a great choice for school it is strong both academically and socially.', 'The University of Wisconsin-Madison is open, diverse and unique with a club or community for everyone. The university is research oriented and has many opportunities for many different disciplines and plenty of classes for all interests from African dance to nuclear engineering. In addition, Madison is a very fun city with plenty of opportunities to get involved outside of the university.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,121,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

With every incident, there is e-mails sent out on WiscAlert, so that they ensure the safety of students. Campus safety is taken very seriously and allows for the student to feel secure on such a large campus.', 'The Greek Life in Madison is a big deal. Numerous students rush every semester. Greek life allows for a lot of social activities to get to know more people around campus and become a part of a group.', 'UW-Madison offers a giant array of different clubs and activities. Any sport, hobby, or even like that you have, you will be sure to find a match on campus. Madison also has some of these most random clubs and activities that I have ever learned about in a campus. It provides great opportunities and endless possibilities.', 'I think Madison is great for all types of students. I never realized how diverse it was before coming here. People from every state and many countries come here. There are quiet, loud, and every kind of student that you can think of on campus. I am positive that is impossible to not make a friend.', 'The cheering sections at sporting events is a tradition at this school, and it is a blast with the various authentic cheers and songs that are still held prominent at them. Some locations are the beautiful Menona Terrace overlooking Lake Menona, Picnic Point, also on the lake, and the many historical sites on Bascom Hill and many other places on campus.', 'There are a lot of things to do for fun in Madison. The city is very big, and there are a lot of places to explore. Whether you go to a party or restaurant or take a stroll down State Street, it is always a good time. Sports are also really big here, allowing for you many options to attend a football, basketball, or hockey game on many occasions.', 'Our dining hall is pretty good for the most part. There is a lot of variety to choose from. However, the food gets old sometimes because it is normal to just want a home cooked meal or to eat in your dorm. Also, the options are not always the healthiest, but there is a station to build your own salad, and there is always fruit and vegetables.', 'I personally love the dorm life and all of the new experiences and friends that it has brought to me. However, I am not a fan of living in such a small area where you have all of your belongings. I am also not too fond of the public bathrooms and showers that are not always exactly the cleanest.', 'The academics here are extremely rigorous. It is very different from high school. There is less class time and more your own time. Lots of reading is entailed for success in your classes, and studying for multiple hours is a must. Even when nothing is due tomorrow, there is still always something you could or meed to be doing. The amount of effort you put, your grades will show for it.', ""My tips for prospective students are to work hard in everything that you do, follow your dreams, and believe that you can. With hard work anything is possible, you just have to put your mind to it. Dreams should also be followed, because you want to go to school for something that you are going to love in the long run and enjoy going to work everyday. Don't do what other people want you to. Also believe that you can do the things you strive for. Achieving comes out of believing in your own abilities and showing confidence to bare your skills."", 'I rate Madison extremely high because I have loved everything about it so far. The academics push you to your full potential, and they really allow you to learn and grasp a better understanding. The social aspect of Madison is also outstanding, and I would have never expected to make so many friends in such a short period of time.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,167,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

There's also Picnic Point, which is a fun location to have campfires, or to jog to on a nice day. And most importantly...there's badger gamedays!! There is nothing like this. Showing up to a badger football game is one of the most exhilarating things to experience. It will truly astonish you as you see the sea of red marching towards Camp Randall to fill the stadium to cheer on the badgers on Saturdays. Being in the student section of a badger football game is one of the best memories you will hold onto in your life.

"[['Categories', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students', 'In three sentences'], ['Comments', 'Since UW Madison is known for the active nightlife, it is true that there are many fun parties to attend, but that is not where all of the fun lies. In the fall, the famous Badger football games are the ultimate crowd pleasers. Being surrounded by a field of red and swinging around chanting songs with your friends while supporting your favorite football team is one of the most fun ways to spend your Saturdays. In addition, UW Madison offers five hundred student organizations. These are groups of students run by students and are extremely fun to partake in and may eventually lead to a leadership position within the club, which always looks good on a resume. Joining something that intrigues your interest such as robotics club or swing dancing can make the college experience that much more fun. If there is something that you are interested in but it is not offered, then all you need to do is start your own student organization and the school will fund you the money to create one. This can be a fun and innovative way to endorse your leadership skills. Furthermore, if you are an active person but not committed enough to a sport to join the professional UW teams, intermural teams are an alternative route to pursuing your passions. Other things that you can do for fun are go swimming on Lake Mendota during the summer, or go skiing on the lake during the winter. ThatÃƒÂ¢??s the thing about UW Madison, there is always just so much to do that itÃƒÂ¢??s difficult to find time to fit it all in.', 'Although food and dining can get somewhat expensive at UW because there is no meal plan, the options available are more than enough. Since you have to spend the entire year there, in my opinion, it is more beneficial to pay just a little bit more and have more options instead of pay the minimal amount but be stuck eating the same food each week. The dining halls have different sections for different meals that one may be in the mood for. There are many stations: noodles, sandwich, Asian food, Mexican food, a salad bar, etc. Each day, there is fresh fruit and dessert, and the fridges are stocked with any type of drink imaginable. Overall, there are abundant options available to satisfy everyone.', 'The dorm life at UW Madison is phenomenal. There are various places that a student can choose to live on campus; it all depends on oneÃƒÂ¢??s personality. At UW Madison, there are two ÃƒÂ¢??neighborhoodsÃƒÂ¢??, Southeast, which is like the downtown area, and Lakeshore, which is the quieter area by the lake. As can be inferred, Southeast is the place where all of the parties and nightlife is centered around, meaning that it is a very rambunctious neighborhood to live in. Nonetheless, the dorms in Southeast are highly populated, so it is very easy to make friends and be social. On the other hand, Lakeshore is a more peaceful and calming place to live. There are small houses spread right along the lake, with few people populating each house. The bright side upon living in these houses on Lakeshore is that you can make long-lasting, meaningful friendships. In addition, since the Lakeshore neighborhood is a more peaceful atmosphere, it is much easier to focus on your studies and not get distracted. Either way, each dorm is special in its own way; it ultimately just comes down to personality. Wherever a student ends up living, they will get the total dorm experience, in just a different form.', 'The academic rigor at UW Madison is unbelievably challenging; but I say that in the most positive sense. There are a lot of introductory courses that many freshmen must take, in which there are about three hundred students per lecture hall and only fifteen percent of the students, which equates to about forty five students, will end up with an A in the course. This may be somewhat intimidating to students who have come into UW Madison as valedictorians of their high school, but nonetheless, it is a good form of intimidation because it forces each student to try their absolute best and put a lot of effort into their work. The professors at UW also make the transition a lot easier because they are always willing to help the student comprehend the material, but it is up to the student to visit them during their office hours. Doing this can be extremely beneficial because everyone is in the same boat, the material will be challenging for everyone, but the ones who ask for help are the ones who stand out to the professor. In return, the relationship that a student builds with their professor will only benefit them in the long run.', 'If I could advise prospective students upon arriving to Madison, I would give them two basic tips. The first piece of advice would be to not procrastinate. Procrastination is extremely common among college students because it seems as if you have more time to get things done as opposed to during the high school days, but this extra time that is available goes by very quickly and you are left to cramming a seven page research paper the night before it is due. Procrastination leads to nothing but poor results and it is not worth risking your grades to learn this lesson the hard way. The second piece of advice that I would give to prospective students is to try their best to come out of their comfort zone. It is a bit intimidating to do this when you are attending such a large and prestigious school, but it is definitely rewarding because it can lead to encountering upon something you love doing and making life-long friends.

There is a program called safe walk where a male and female will come pick you up from anywhere on campus at night and walk with you to any place you're going on campus free of charge, so that you aren't alone at night. It is a great way to be able to have fun and stay safe. The university also sends out alerts through text or email (your choice) if there is a threat of any kind on campus and does a fantastic job of keeping you up to date of what is happening, which areas to avoid, and when the threat is gone."", ""Greek life is prevalent on campus, but isn't dominant. If you want to be in a sorority or fraternity, there is plenty to choose from and rush week is crazy! But if it isn't your thing, its not a big deal at all. It is not clique-y like high school."", 'Great for all types of students! There is definitely a fit here for everyone! Everyone learns differently and enjoys different things and the university recognizes this and provides many opportunities for tutoring, research, clubs, activities, and other pastimes. There is literally something here for everyone.', ""There are many traditions, such as the snowball fight and Abe Lincoln's toe, but to find out more about these traditions and discover others, come to campus for a visit or just attend school here!"", 'Its a lot of money, but with the many opportunities on campus for research and internships, the well-known professors, academic rigor, and guidance provided by advisors, I feel like students here are just about getting an ivy league level of education for a lot less money than an actual ivy league. It is such a well known school and it takes pride in keeping its reputation among the best. Definitely worth the money!', 'There is plenty to do on campus, no matter what you enjoy. The school does have a big reputation for partying, and there definitely is a lot of that on campus, but there is also much more to do. There are beautiful trails to bike and walk on, and there are plenty of clubs to join that hold many activities throughout the semesters. Dorms hold several activities throughout the semester as well, for you to get to know the others that you are living with. Sports games are huge on campus and going to any kind of Badger game is always a good time and always exciting. State St. is just a block off campus with plenty to do, from shopping to several restaurants and coffee shops. Overall, there is something for everyone in the endless supply of things to do on campus or just off campus.', 'The food is really good on campus and there are plenty of dining halls to go to, no matter where you are on campus. There is no meal plan, just putting money onto your ID card, which doubles as a sort of debit card on campus, and using it to buy the food and other things on campus, such as laundry. Its a much more convenient way to keep track of your money and saves you from wasting any. They do a great job of having variety in the food choices and just about all the dining halls on campus are new.', 'Dorm life here is definitely like no other! There are two neighborhoods on campus where dorms are located. Lakeshore dorms are more far away from classes and are quieter. Southeast dorms have a good location on campus and are more for the social butterflies. Southeast dorms are louder and there is definitely always more going on on that side of campus. All dorms host different activities though, especially at the start of each semester, as a chance to get to know the people you are living with/near, which can be a lot of fun.', 'Not going to lie, this is definitely a tough school, but when your willing to make the effort to study and do as well as you possibly can, your grades will definitely reflect that. The professors are at the top of their field so they can expect a lot sometimes, but it makes you have a fuller understanding of the topic. The academic rigor makes you more proud of yourself and your grades when you do well and is often more rewarding.', 'Be ready to put in lots of hard work! The classes are tough and in no way like high school classes, but if you put in the time and effort to do well, your hard work will be reflected in your GPA. And before your first day of classes in the fall, do a walk through of where your classes are. Its a big campus and can be intimidating at first but doing a walk through of your schedule is super helpful and makes your first day more exciting and less nerve-racking.', 'As big as the school is, there is a strong sense of community and school spirit on campus that, to me, makes it very special and sets it apart from other big 10 schools. Game days are like no other, and there is always something to do, no matter what your preference. The campus is gorgeous and your professors are at the top of their field.']]",University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Madison/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/118185,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,203,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00051-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,902212559,902010411,HORIZONTAL,"{389112=During Fall, Saturdays on campus are a swarm of Red and White for Badger football games.

It's a very large campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus and I feel as though the services that Madison provides are sufficient. There is Safe Walk, which will walk you home from anywhere, no questions asked. The buses run all night and are free for University students, and the Campus police are always helpful and on call should you decide you need them."", ""I was not a part of Greek life, but it is part of the campus if that is something that you are interested in. I have friends in Greek Life, and we have Greek Row on Langdon. People who choose to join love it and I'm glad it's part of our culture. That being said, Greek Life does not run the culture at Madison, it does not over power other activities or interferre really in the average students life. It's just fun if that's what you want to do."", 'There are so many clubs that my head could explode. From Professional assocations like Society of Women Engineers to the Slack Line Club, (both of which I am a member) there is something for every one and should you feel like the clubs that already exist do not meet your needs, never fear...CREATE YOUR OWN! In addition to the clubs mentioned above, I am also in the Swing Dancing Club, which is the most fun I have ever had. If I could change my major to swing dancing I would. No joke.', 'Great for all types of students! There are so many people that you will find those who love the same things you do. Big lectures work for people who learn that way, but the broken down discussions and office hours leave plenty of room for one on one time if thats what you require. Every person I have run into wants you to succeed, but you have to make it happen.', ""At every football game, after the third quarter, the whole stadium gets up on its feet and makes the ground shake by dancing and screaming to the song Jump Around by House of Pain. It's catchy and energized and the whole stadium comes together in school spirit and general merriment. It's great, and every Badger should experience the rush."", 'I am an instate student, so I pay instate tution and I feel like I could not ask for anything more. I am beyond blessed that I was lucky enough to be a resident and recieve instate tution rates. People pay out of state tution to attend this fine institution and from what I have heard, they feel like they are getting enough bang for their buck as well.', ""There is so much to do that I can't even begin to express it. There are free movies at the Marquee, football games, hockey games, all other sporting events, tail gating, theatre performances, poetry readings, free art classes, countless clubs that host many events with free food most of the time, bonfires at Picnic Point, dances, shoppping, and literally any type of restuarant that you can think of. My favorites place are Nepali and Korean food, which is something that I have never experienced before going to Madison. And if that isn't enough for you, I'm sure you could stop in on a party."", ""Food is very good. There is always a variety, each little section of the dining hall has new dish each day, along with some staples if you like a little bit more continuity. There is always a supply of fresh fruit and a salad bar. The food is a la cart, so you never pay more than what you consume. There are times that you are gonna miss Mom's chicken pot pie, but that's inevitable, even if they were feeding you lobster every day."", ""Dorm life is great, as long as you pick the right dorm. If you are quieter and maybe like to stop in at the party but not live in it, Lakeshore dorms are for you. Organized into little neighborhoods and right along the lake, it's perfect for taking a run, throwing a frisbee, or decompressing from class in the sunshine. If you are the life of the party then the south east dorms are for you. Dancing late into the night and groups of people laughing for hours are commonplace, sometimes even on week nights. Whatever you choose, bonding with your floor mates is something that you will never get to replace."", ""Madison is no joke, you have to be serious about your studies. Some classes will kick you in the butt, but you will learn. Go to class. Make flash cards. Do the work your Professors tell you to do even if you don't turn it in and nobody checks it. This isn't highschool, nobody is holding your hand. It's work, but I'm also recieving a world-class education that will prepare me to be a sucessful human being."", ""You here this everywhere and from everyone, because it's true, JOIN THINGS! And take a risk when you do. Sure, join something you know you are already passionate about, but take a risk. Do something that makes you a little scared. I personally walked on the to Rowing Team and it was simultaneously the best and the hardest thing I have ever done. It's honestly the most rewarding thing I have ever done and I had to push myself to do it. Plus, I met my future roommate which was awesome."", ""The University of Wisconsin- Madison is everything someone could ask for in a college experience. The campus and surrounding city overflow with life and excitement, from walking down State St. and visiting the Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings, to spending a Tuesday night studying into the wee hours, and seeing others do the same, the sense of community cannot be matched.

A tail-log backup captures the log that has not yet been backed up (the tail of the log) and is the last backup of interest in a recovery plan. Restoring a database without first backing up the tail of the log results is a mistake, unless the RESTORE statement contains either the WITH REPLACE or WITH STOPAT clause., 111347=Windows 2008 (standard x64 edition), 108284=For a previous client our production build of SQL Server was 9.0.3152, so naturally the DRP server had to be the exact same build Ã¢Â€Â“ both systems must be as identical as possible., 105071=Sunday 6:30, 4326=Born and raised in Vancouver, Canada, with a brief excursion to study in Brussels, Melbourne & Washington D.C., Hugo has been working with SQL Server since 1998.
