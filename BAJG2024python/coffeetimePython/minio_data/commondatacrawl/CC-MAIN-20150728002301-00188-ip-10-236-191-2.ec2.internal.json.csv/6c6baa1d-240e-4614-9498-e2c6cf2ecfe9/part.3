However it is not advisable to pluck or wax the area between treatments as this disturbs the hair growth cycle which can make subsequent treatments less effective. However when returning for follow-on treatment please ensure that 1-2mm of hair is visible on the surface of your skin. You must also ensure that the area to be treated is not tanned, as explained above. Regrettably it is not possible to treat tanned skin for safety reasons. After treatment advice It is common to experience some redness and in some instances a heat rash. This should have dissipated in one to eight hours following treatment. Occasionally superficial Ã¢Â€Â˜skin flakingÃ¢Â€Â™ is experienced. This is a normal temporary reaction. The following skin care is advised: apply soothing cream such as Aloe Vera gel or after-sun lotion and continue your normal skin care routine.

Here's a breakdown of the differences between the kits: Choose from two kits You may choose to catch the burnt wish paper with the paper platform. However, this isn't necessary from a safety standpoint. The ash is cool to the touch. The earthly remains of your wish will float slowly back down after the wish paper has burned. We suggest catching it with your wish platform. However, it's completely safe to catch the ash with your hands. The remains are cool to the touch almost immediately after it has burned out. Catch what's left of your wish paper on the wish platform Just as the wish paper is nearly burnt up, it will fly into the air. The wish paper will burn from top to bottom in about 5 seconds. As soon as the flame reaches the bottom of the wish paper, the paper will suddenly take flight. Step 3: Watch it fly! Next, roll the wish paper into a tube and use a match","Choose between mini and large Flying Wish Paper kits. Frequently Asked Questions Question: Is this product dangerous? Answer: While anything having to do with fire is potentially dangerous, Flying Wish Paper is actually more safe than a traditional candle. Flying Wish Paper only burns for roughly 6-8 seconds. As it heads into the air, it is nearly finished burning and becomes cool to the touch almost immediately thereafter. However, use common sense and follow the instructions on the packaging to ensure maximum safety. Question: Can I use Flying Wish Paper indoors? Answer: Yes. In fact, it is intended to be used indoors. Windy conditions outdoors will most likely knock over your wish paper. Question: Why are there fewer wish platforms than sheets of wish paper in each kit? Answer: Each wish platform can be used multiple times. Question: Seriously, is Flying Wish Paper going to set my drapes on fire? Answer: No. The paper itself does not have any accelerants or propellants added to it. So, as soon as the paper has completely burned (which occurs in about 6-8 seconds), there is no more ""fuel"" for the fire. Question: How do I roll the Flying Wish Paper into a tube? Answer: Just wrap the paper around your index finger and then set it on the wish platform.",True,0,0,,
