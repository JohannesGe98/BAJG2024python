While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. WLAJ-TV LLC has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 25 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 51817=At the request of Chris Samples Broadcasting, Inc., licensee of Station KXDJ(FM), Channel 252C2, Spearman, Texas, the Audio Division amends the FM Table of Allotments, by substituting Channel 221A for vacant Channel 252A at Silverton, Texas to accommodate the Application that requests to upgrade the facilities of Station KXDJ(FM) from Channel 252C2 to Channel 252C1 at Spearman, Texas. The channel substitution at Silverton, Texas would be in the public interest because it would accommodate the Application and eliminate the Station KICA-FM 73.215 short-spacing. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 221A can be allotted to Silverton, Texas consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) east of Silverton. The reference coordinates are 34-28-15 NL and 101-13-09 WL., 99798=The Audio Division, at the request of Threshold Communications, substitutes FM Channel 235C1 for Channel 249C1 at Altamont, Oregon. Channel 235C1 can be allotted at Altamont in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 20 km (12.6 miles) northeast of Altamont, at 42-08-37 North Latitude and 121-30-19 West Longitude., 258460=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Ã‚Â§ 73.202(b) of the Commission's rules, by allotting Channel 277A at Shelter Island, New York, as a first local service. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 277A can be allotted to Shelter Island consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's rules with a site restriction located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of the community. The reference coordinates are 40-57-54 NL and 72-22-59 WL., 128795=In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) announces that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved, for a period of three years, the information collection associated with the Commission's Report and Order, 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review, FCC 14-28. This notice is consistent with the Report and Order, which stated that the Commission would publish a document in the Federal Register announcing OMB approval and the effective date of the requirements., 405739=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Entravision Holdings, LLC (Ã¢Â€ÂœEntravisionÃ¢Â€?), the licensee of station KCEC(TV), channel 51, Denver, Colorado, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Denver. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. KCEC(TV) has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 26 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 156330=The Audio Division, at the request of JER Licenses, LLC, substitute alternative Channel 281C for vacant Channel 280C at Toquerville, Utah to accommodate the Ã¢Â€ÂœhybridÃ¢Â€? application that requests the downgrade of the new FM station from Channel 281C3 to Channel 280A at Peach Springs, Arizona. A staff engineering analysis confirms that Channel 281C can be allotted to Toquerville, Utah consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Rules without a site restriction. The reference coordinates for Channel 281C at Toquerville are 37-15-12 NL and 113-17-00 WL. See Supplementary Info. supra., 159346=Title 47 published on 2014-10-01, 278266=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Section 73.202(b) of the Commission's Rules, by allotting Channel 233A at Sagaponack, New York, as a first local service.

In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 243058=In this document, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) further extends the deadline for filing comments on the Auction 1000 Request for Comment, which initiates the pre-auction process by which the Federal Communications Commission will develop detailed procedures for the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, taking into account public comment received in response to its proposals., 318051=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by KCEB License Company, LLC (Ã¢Â€ÂœKCEB LicenseÃ¢Â€?), the licensee of KCEB(TV), channel 51, Longview, Texas, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 51 at Longview. While the Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of full power television rulemaking petitions requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, it subsequently announced that it would lift the freeze to accept such petitions for rulemaking seeking to relocate from channel 51 pursuant to a voluntary relocation agreement with Lower 700 MHz A Block licensees. KCEB License has entered into such a voluntary relocation agreement with T-Mobile USA, Inc. and states that operation on channel 26 would eliminate potential interference to and from wireless operations in the adjacent Lower 700 MHZ A Block., 208093=The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by TDS Broadcasting LLC (Ã¢Â€ÂœTDSÃ¢Â€?), the licensee of KOHD, channel 51, Bend, Oregon, requesting the substitution of channel 18 for channel 51 at Bend.

The Auction 1000 Request for Comment includes specific proposals, including on determination of the initial broadcast television spectrum clearing target, opening bid prices, benchmarks for the final stage rule, and the final television channel assignment process, and seeks comment on those proposed procedures., 430508=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Chris Samples Broadcasting, Inc, licensee of Station KXDJ(FM), Channel 252C2, Spearman, Texas, proposing to substitute Channel 221A for vacant Channel 252A at Silverton, Texas. A staff engineering analysis indicates that Channel 221A can be allotted to Silverton, Texas consistent with the minimum distance separation requirements of the Commission's Rules with a site restriction located 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) east of Silverton.

Aunque no existe un lÃƒÂ­mite definido en cuanto al nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces que deberÃƒÂ­a incluir en una pÃƒÂ¡gina, es mejor limitar el nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces a 200 por pÃƒÂ¡gina.
