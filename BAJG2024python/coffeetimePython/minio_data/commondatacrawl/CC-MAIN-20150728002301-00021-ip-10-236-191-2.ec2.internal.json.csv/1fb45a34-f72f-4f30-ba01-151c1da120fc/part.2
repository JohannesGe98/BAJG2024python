This is just a provisional pre-entry list, so expect some changes, especially in the 250SX class.

Ã‚Â These stages are based on five factors: primary tumor characteristics (T), involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), presence of distant metastasis (M), PSA and histologic grade (G), which represents the Gleason score. These values are combined to give a stage from 0-IV. The staging guidelines are published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 2014). Staging Once the tissue is removed, a doctor called a pathologist will examine the specimen under a microscope. The pathologist can tell if it is cancer or not; and if it is cancerous, the pathologist will characterize it by what type of prostate cancer it is and how abnormal it looks (known as the grade). The vast majority of all prostate cancers (at least 95%) are a subtype known as adenocarcinoma, but occasionally they can be small cell carcinomas or lymphomas (two rare types of prostate cancer that are treated differently than the more standard adenocarcinomas). The pathologist then characterizes how much the cancer looks like normal prostate tissue, and this is known as the grade of the tumor. Pathologists often use a scale, called the Gleason score, when they grade prostate tumors. The Gleason score can range from 2 to 10, with 2 being a very normal looking tumor and 10 being a very abnormal looking tumor. Generally, the more abnormal the tumor looks, the more aggressive it is.",M1 Distant mestastasis M1a Non-regional lymph node(s) M1b Bone(s) M1c Other site(s) with or without bone disease or more than one site of metastasis is present (pM1c) Histologic Grade (G) Gleason X Gleason score cannot be processed Gleason ? 6 Well differentiated (slight anaplasia) Gleason 7 Moderately differentiated (moderate anaplasia) Gleason 8-10 Poorly differentiated/undifferentiated (marked anaplasia) Anatomic Stage/Prognostic Groups * Stage (Group) T N M PSA G I T1a-c N0 M0 PSA <10 Gleason ? 6 Ã‚Â  T2a N0 M0 PSA <10 Gleason ? 6 Ã‚Â  T1-2a N0 M0 PSA X Gleason X IIA T1a-c N0 M0 PSA <20 Gleason 7 Ã‚Â  T1a-c N0 M0 PSA ? 10 <20 Gleason ? 6 Ã‚Â  T2 N0 M0 PSA <20 Gleason ? 7 Ã‚Â  T2b N0 M0 PSA <20 Gleason ? 7,False,-1,0,"{18622=OncoLink Team The Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Last Modified: January 28, 2015, 15470=Every man is at risk for prostate cancer as he ages.

Powered by Xpose Media Designed by: Xpose Media",True,1,0,,"{11733=R.T.: In primul si in primul rand trebuie mentionat faptul ca piata online din Romania este in stadiul sau incipial de dezvoltare, din cauza faptului ca internetul nu este folosit de nici macar 50% din populatia activa a Romaniei, ceea ce inseamna ca discutia de astazi va fi despre o piata aflata in curs de dezvoltare, nicidecum despre o piata dezvoltata sau mai mult, despre una saturata. Incepand cu anul 2000 incoace, s-au pus bazele unor idei de magazine online. Printre primii antreprenori care s-au gandit la deschiderea unui astfel de magazin virtual au fost comerciantii de haine si de incaltaminte, care au dorit sa-si vanda produsele si pe internet, ei vazand o adevarata solutie un website, in locul chiriilor uriase din marile centre comerciale, dar si o alternativa la cumparaturile clasice ce necesitau o gramada de timp pierdut printre rafturi. De atunci si pana in 2012, magazine virtuale au tot continuat sa apara, ritmul si diversitatea lor fiind intr-o continua crestere. Au aparut magazine virtuale de bijuterii, accesorii, pana chiar si magazine online de cadouri sau de alte chestiuni haioase. Este meritul desavarsit al antreprenorilor pasionati de dezvoltarea afacerilor pe care le-au creat, dar si al e-commerce-ului. Cu siguranta, aceste magazine online se vor inmulti si in continuare, iar concurenta va fi tot mai mare, lucru deosebit de benefic pentru clienti., 13563=R.T.: Asa cum am mentionat si anterior, magazinele online de imbracaminte au fost printre primele care au aparut in tara noastra si si-au continuat trend-ul ascendent pana in 2012 si il vor continua probabil cel putin 7-10 ani de acum inainte. Magazinele online de imbracaminte au avantajul ca pot fi accesate de oriunde, oricand, ele sunt deschise 24 de ore din 24, produsele sunt intr-un numar mult mai mare decat intr-un mall, deoarece antreprenorii nu mai platesc tone de bani pentru chiria spatiilor de vanzare situate cat mai central, acestia avand in schimb depozite cu produsele, depozite de unde si pleaca marfa spre clienti. Este un real avantaj sa poti consulta in acelasi timp mii de produse pe site-urile de profil, in loc sa umblii dintr-un mall intr-altul, sa vezi daca gasesti sau nu ceva pe gustul tau sau daca respectivul produs este ori nu este pe stoc si asa mai departe. Practic, a cumpara haine dintr-un magazin online de imbracaminte este o solutie alternativa viabila si de un real succes, iar asta o pot argumenta solid: accesibilitate si manevrabilitate extrem de usoara in urma navigarii pe un website de profil, functii de cautare si filtre special dedicate pentru a ajunge la produsl dorit, oferte de preturi si de reduceri pentru a fideliza publicul cu produsele vandute, dar si cu acest tip de cumparaturi online, posibilitati nenumarate de a face platile (transfer bancar, plata cu cardul personal de cumparaturi, plata prin servicii electronice securizate ca PayPal sau MoneyBookers, etc.), timp de livrare intre 24 Ã¢Â€Â“ 48 de ore oriunde ati fi in tara, precum si multe, multe altele.}",

This meeting date was changed from an earlier date and I have a feeling it will be moved again into the summer. Should this happen, I feel there will be further weakness in the share price. Good news if you are planning to buy soon but not so good if you want to sell as this kind of an announcement will see impatient investors head for the exits. Don't get me wrong. I see lots of potential here for longer term investors but you will be disappointed if you think you can jump in, be eligible for the ORTSBO dividend and jump ou with a quick profit.t.

We have to say the results are pretty dramatic, as the Impala looked like a tugboat going though the cones. At one point, we thought the bumper was going to drag the ground. After the new stuff was on, the car was flat and much more controllable. We actually reached the limits of the engine before we could reach the limits of the new suspension and rolling stock package. For the actual installation and track testing, we took a mostly stock '64 Impala to Willow Springs Raceway in Rosamond, California. We say mostly because the car had a power steering conversion from Classic Performance Products (CPP) that uses a more traditional power steering box, instead of the ram assist the factory used. Other than that, the car is a really nice stocker with a well worn 327 and Powerglide. The car was before and after tested on a 600-foot slalom and 200-foot diameter skid pad, with Chief Engineer Aaron Ogowa from Hotchkis behind the wheel. Since we were going to do the install at the track, we needed an expert wrench on hand. That came in the form of Corey Bedortha. The author helped when not manning the camera, but Corey","200-ft Skidpad Before Direction Time G-Force CCW 14.27 0.60 CW 14.37 0.59 After Direction Time G-Force CCW 12.67 0.76 CW 12.90 0.74 Just for reference, here are the numbers Hotchkis got with a new 5th gen Camaro SS on the same track, with the same driver. Skid Pad: 0.85g and Slalom: 66.4 mph 41/41 34 Here is how the Impala looks with all the new goodies. Not only does the car handle much better, it has the look of a super Chevy. We would like to lower the rear just a little bit more, but we know some really like the raked look as do we, just not quite this much. Since Hotchkis will be coming out with springs and shocks for this system by the end of 2012, we will revisit this '64 when those become available. We are sure both components will help even more. Till then, we'll get some discs on the car, and possibly a little more power underhood.

Hotchkis built all new upper and lower trailing arms that are a much stiffer design and construction, with polyurethane bushings to reduce deflection while maintaining good joint articulation. Also, the upper trailing arm is adjustable, so the pinion angle can be changed to alleviate any driveline vibration. The last piece in the rear suspension puzzle is an adjustable panhard rod that allows you to easily center the rearend, maximizing straight-line performance and tire clearance, no matter what static ride height is.

After a bit of back and forth, we thought we had the first name down, but were still unsure about the second name. I tried to find another authoritative source that gave pronunciations, but really couldn't. For pop culture questions, sometimes the best answer comes from polling the wisdom of the crowd - and there were lots of search matches for how to pronounce bryn terfel. The most helpful website was http://www.pronunciationguide.info/thebiglist.html which is a long list of names, phonetic spellings, and an audio clip of the pronunciations. It sounded more or less like what I expected after reading the other websites, and I played it for the patron by holding the phone up to the computer's speakers. What will the internet think of next?

This change does not affect any of the data in the newly released 2010 U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations & Membership Study. In fact, the data for these groups are now more comparable to that of other bodies than it was in previous decadal reports.

In fact, the data for these groups are now more comparable to that of other bodies than it was in previous decadal reports., 254344=2010 data were collected by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) and include statistics for 236 religious groups, providing information on the number of their congregations and adherents within each state and county in the United States.

Great writing and a wonderful episode. There was alot of emotion watching Melinda help a girl named Julie who reminds her of herself at a younger age. The development to finding out that Julie was taken as an infant and then reuniting her with her real mom was tear jerking. To see Homer the dog again was great, he seemsÃ‚Â to have a greater purpose of protecting Melinda and Jim. I also think it is great to watch Melinda and Jims relationship, it may be a tv one but one I wish to aspire for.

This episode was honestly so funny! It was a light break form the drama, yet it brought us a lot of develoopment, this episode is definitely ranked as one of my favorites. Grace prokmites a ""Just Say Me"" campaign which means masturbating and now the whole school is Just Say Me, even Amy. The whole Monday-Sunday sequence was hilarious! ItÃ‚Â was good at first, and all the girls were happy and satisfied, then they got bored, hilarious! Meanwhile the guys are getting the cold shoulder from the girls. The only thing wrong with this episode is all the parents being okay with Just Say Me, seems a bit unrealistic. I love how Grace's idea goes out of proportion like that. Adrian & Amy become friends! And they actually mean it by the end, as Amy lets Adrian hold her baby, a bit unexpected, but GREAT development. Madison & Jack start dating by the end. Lauren gets a guy out of nowhere. And Ashley remains single.

However, volatile oil prices and political pressures for more fuel-efficient cars have taken a toll on the market for these larger vehicles. As a quick fix, Ford announced plans to retool three manufacturing facilities formerly used to produce trucks to instead make six of its more fuel efficient european models in the US (such as the Mondeo and European version of the Focus, both of which are far more efficient than Ford's current American offerings).[17] This offers the advantage of quickly bringing highly demanded fuel efficient cars to the U.S. market without having to invest the money and time to create an entirely new automobile.[18] In the longer-term, the company intends for all of its vehicles to be the leader (or co-leader) for fuel economy in any given car category. The company is also embracing lower tech solutions such as low resistance tires and 6-speed automatic transmissions that improve fuel efficiency over transmissions with fewer gears. These 6-speed transmissions allow the engine to rev at more efficient levels and improve fuel efficiency by 4-6% over the 4 and 5 speed transmissions currently installed on most Ford vehicles.[19] Ford hopes to build 98% of its vehicles with six-speed transmissions by 2012.[citation needed], 76989=The company's balance sheet liquidity improved in FY 2011, reporting reporting a 9.8 billion USD net cash position vs. 1.4 billion USD in FY 2010.[15]}",

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 61869=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 21216=From the marketÃ¢Â€Â™s perspective, however, a positive jobs picture may raise unnerving questions about what the Fed would do to its to its bond-purchase program. Looked at from that Fed prism, this morningÃ¢Â€Â™s jobs data could be viewed as market unfriendly. The ADP report shows a total of 188K private sector jobs in June vs. consensus expectations of about 175K. The May tally was modestly revised lower to 134K from 135K. This reportÃ¢Â€Â™s primary purpose is to serve as a preview of the non-farm payroll report from the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s BLS coming out on Friday. The consensus expectation is for Ã¢Â€Â˜headlineÃ¢Â€Â™ BLS gains of +161K, though a straight extrapolation from todayÃ¢Â€Â™s ADP report would mean a positive surprise on Friday. If the government sector lost about 10K jobs in June as has been the case in recent months, then a straight extrapolation from the ADP number would mean a +178K headline jobs tally Friday. But with the ADP report consistently undershooting the BLS numbers in recent months, we could be in for a bigger positive surprise on Friday. The positivity coming out of this report is broad-based, with employers of all sizes adding to payrolls. Small businesses, employers having less than 50 employees, added +84K jobs in June vs. 58K jobs in May. Medium-sized businesses (less than 500 employees) added +55K in June vs. +39K jobs in May, while large businesses (1000+ employees) added +49K in June vs. +39K jobs in the preceding month. Notably, the goods-producing sector added +27K jobs in June, the biggest gain in four months, with gains in the construction sector the biggest since January this year at +21K. Manufacturing added +1K jobs in June after shedding jobs in the preceding two months, broadly in-line with what we saw in the June manufacturing ISM report on Monday, which showed the factory sector getting back into positive territory after falling into contraction territory the month before. Most of the May jobs came from the services-providing sectors, with gains on that side at +161K. We will get the service sector ISM report a little later. The big issue from the marketÃ¢Â€Â™s perspective is what all of this means for Fed policy. My sense is that this report is consistent with a steadily improving economy that affords the Fed enough flexibility to take its foot off the QE paddle. The ADP report hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t been a very accurate predictor of BLS numbers in recent months. But if we are on track to get a positive number on Friday, then I would expect the Ã¢Â€Â˜taperÃ¢Â€Â™ scenario to be back in the spotlight, notwithstanding denials and explanations from Fed officials.}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 21:02:30 -0500"

The ADP report shows a total of 188K private sector jobs in June vs. consensus expectations of about 175K. The May tally was modestly revised lower to 134K from 135K. This reportÃ¢Â€Â™s primary purpose is to serve as a preview of the non-farm payroll report from the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s BLS coming out on Friday. The consensus expectation is for Ã¢Â€Â˜headlineÃ¢Â€Â™ BLS gains of +161K, though a straight extrapolation from todayÃ¢Â€Â™s ADP report would mean a positive surprise on Friday. If the government sector lost about 10K jobs in June as has been the case in recent months, then a straight extrapolation from the ADP number would mean a +178K headline jobs tally Friday. But with the ADP report consistently undershooting the BLS numbers in recent months, we could be in for a bigger positive surprise on Friday. The positivity coming out of this report is broad-based, with employers of all sizes adding to payrolls. Small businesses, employers having less than 50 employees, added +84K jobs in June vs. 58K jobs in May. Medium-sized businesses (less than 500 employees) added +55K in June vs. +39K jobs in May, while large businesses (1000+ employees) added +49K in June vs. +39K jobs in the preceding month. Notably, the goods-producing sector added +27K jobs in June, the biggest gain in four months, with gains in the construction sector the biggest since January this year at +21K. Manufacturing added +1K jobs in June after shedding jobs in the preceding two months, broadly in-line with what we saw in the June manufacturing ISM report on Monday, which showed the factory sector getting back into positive territory after falling into contraction territory the month before. Most of the May jobs came from the services-providing sectors, with gains on that side at +161K. We will get the service sector ISM report a little later. The big issue from the marketÃ¢Â€Â™s perspective is what all of this means for Fed policy. My sense is that this report is consistent with a steadily improving economy that affords the Fed enough flexibility to take its foot off the QE paddle. The ADP report hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t been a very accurate predictor of BLS numbers in recent months.

Judges 17-18). Joshua told Ephraim earlier that if they wanted more land they should conquer what was already allocated to them. Some commentators see this as explaining Dan's relocation, but to me it was an act of unbelief. This is why it is listed in the conclusion of Judges (cf. chapters 17-21) which documents the Israelites acts of faithlessness. Dan's original allocation was in the Philistine area. They chose to move instead of trusting YHWH to help them take their land., 9345=19:1 Part of Judah's land was given to Simeon. Simeon was incorporated early into Judah and lost its identity. It is not even listed in Moses' blessings to the tribes in Deuteronomy 33., 19516=NASB (UPDATED TEXT): JOSHUA 19:51 Ã‚Â 51These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land., 12294=19:15 ""Bethlehem"" This means ""house of bread"" (BDB 111, cf. Jdgs. 12:8,10); it was about ten miles west of Nazareth. It was a common name. This is not the one in Judah (i.e., Gen. 35:19; 48:7; Ruth 1:1-2,19; Micah 5:2)., 10730=Simeon's allotted area was totally surrounded by Judah's allotment. In time Simeon disappears as an individual tribe. They are not even listed in Moses' blessings of Deuteronomy 33. In 1 Kgs. 19:3 Beersheba (cf. Jos. 19:2) is said to belong to Judah., 9837=Ã¢Â–Â£ ""Sheba"" In Jos. 15:26, it is called ""Shema"" which is the Hebrew word ""to hear so as to do"" (BDB 1035). It is the name of the famous creedal statement of Deut. 6:4-5 (BDB 1033). The NKJV and the JPSOA translations think it was another way of referring to Beersheba or possibly a scribal error in writing the last of the previous city's name twice. In Jos. 19:6 it says 13 cities, but there are 14 names., 15477=19:28 ""the Great Sidon"" This shows the antiquity of the text because in the future Sidon is replaced by Tyre as Phoenicia's capital (cf. Jos. 19:29)., 13344=19:22 ""Beth-shemesh"" This name means ""sun-temple"" (BDB 112). This is not the same as the city by the same name in the tribal allocation of Judah (cf. Jos. 15:10) or in Naphtali (Jos. 19:38)., 14701=19:27 ""east. . .south"" The ancient Hebrews denoted compass directions by facing ""east"" (the rising sun). The tabernacle faced east. It became a symbol of help and hope. The Messiah will come from the east., 18855=Ã¢Â–Â£ ""Leshem"" This city (BDB 546) is also called Laish (""lion,"" BDB 539, cf. Jdgs. 18:7,14,27,29)., 17060=19:38 ""Beth-anath"" This name means ""temple of Anath"" (BDB 112, cf. Jdgs. 1:32). Anath was a fertility goddess., 16742=19:33 ""from the oak"" Trees often were associated with holy sites (cf. Gen. 13:18; 14:13; 18:1; 21:33; 35:4; Jdgs. 4:5,11; 6:11,19; 9:6,37; 1 Sam. 10:3), possibly because of the presence of underground water which was so valuable to desert and semi-desert peoples., 9575=19:2 ""Beersheba"" This means ""well of oath"" (BDB 92). It is one of the most southern cities. It was part of the idiomatic phrase, ""from Dan to Beersheba"" which described the Promised Land., 10316=19:4 ""Bethul"" This city (""man of God,"" BDB 143) is also in the allocation of Judah (cf. 1 Sam. 30:27; 1 Chr. 4:30, spelled ""Bethuel"")., 12115=19:13 ""Gath-hepher"" This is the birthplace of the prophet Jonah (cf. 2 Kgs. 14:25), about three miles northeast of Nazareth., 10525=19:9 This verse explains why Simeon received part of Judah's land inheritance and also that Judah was having trouble possessing its land., 19973=19:51 ""the tent of meeting"" The tent of meeting is the same as the tabernacle. It is described in Exodus 25-40. Its procedures are given in Leviticus. The Shekinah cloud of glory, which led the Israelites during the exodus and wilderness wandering period, disappeared as soon as Israel crossed Jordan. YHWH's presence was now enshrined at the tabernacle. It was first set up at Gilgal (4:10), then moved to Shiloh (18:1; 19:51; 1 Sam. 2:22). Later the tabernacle, without the ark (Jdgs. 20:18,27), was at Gibeon (cf. 1 Chr. 16:39-40; 2 Chr. 1:3-6)., 20604=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2012 Bible Lessons International}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:38:54 +0000"

This deficit could contribute to decreased activity level, avoidance of driving with resultant diminished independence and, ultimately, limited social interactions and increased isolation. Oscillopsia occurs because of inadequate vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and suggests that compensation for the vestibular loss has not occurred. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of an exercise intervention on visual acuity during head movement in patients with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction. We hypothesized that 1) patients performing vestibular exercises would have improved visual acuity during head movement compared to patients performing placebo exercises; 2) there would be no correlation between dynamic visual acuity (DVA) and the patients' subjective complaints of oscillopsia; and 3) improvement in DVA would be reflected by changes in residual vestibular function as indicated by an increase in VOR gain. Patients are assigned randomly to either the vestibular exercise or placebo exercise group. The randomization schedule is generated using a computer program for 2-sample randomization. The sequence was not concealed from the investigator who obtained consent from the subjects and supervised the exercises (SJH). The group assignment (vestibular exercise or placebo exercise) was concealed from the participants and from the investigator who performed the outcome measures. The vestibular exercise group practiced exercises that consisted of adaptation exercises and eye-head",False,-1,0,,,

Since the emergence of the HIV epidemic in Africa, the incidence rates of TB have risen dramatically, overwhelming national TB control programs across the continent. Over 50% of TB patients presenting to TB clinics in Africa are HIV infected. These patients often present in the early stages of HIV infection. Recent World Health Organization guidelines on the management of HIV-associated pulmonary TB recommend antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in patients with CD4 cells less than 200 cells/mm3, but not for HIV infected TB patients who present with a high CD4 count. In Uganda, over half of HIV infected patients with active TB present to TB clinics with CD4 counts above 200 cells/mm3, and there is evidence that coinfected patients with a high CD4 count should be treated with ARV therapy. First, mortality in HIV-associated TB is high, even when patients respond to effective anti-tuberculosis therapy. Second, excess mortality associated with TB is most evident when CD4 counts are above 200 cell/mm3. Third, in coinfected patients, TB results in prolonged immune activation, which may enhance viral replication and accelerate the decline of CD4 cells. This study will evaluate whether short-term ARV therapy of abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine given during treatment of active TB will slow progression of HIV disease in TB",False,-1,0,,,

Previous Ticket Context Navigation Notifications Login Search: Create a New Ticket Trac Timeline Browse Source Components Tickets Handbook Blog Make WordPress Core Download WordPress Hosting Blog About Get Involved Documentation Forums,"Description This ticket attempts to bring consistency to the way slashes are handled throughout the WordPress API functions that persist data. Currently these API functions expect slashed data and strip slashes within their code. Most of the code that invokes these functions understands this and generally passes slashed data to them (sometimes calling add_magic_quotes() when necessary). Most of the code understands this, but not all. While auditing the code for the purposes of creating this patch I found a variety of places that do not slash data before passing it to the model functions as it currently should be done. Further, most developers do not think to manually add slashes to the data they programatically create and pass to these functions. Finally, it is not documented in the Codex that all data passed to these functions should be slashed before being passed in. As such, we can generally consider such behavior a bug. There are a few potential caveats, which I will cover shortly. Some of the functions that are being affected here: wp_insert_post() wp_update_post() add_post_meta() [and other meta functions that call add_metadata()] update_post_meta() [and other meta functions that call update_metadata()] wp_insert_attachment() wp_insert_term() wp_update_term() up_insert_user() wp_update_user() wp_new_comment() etc... Point being, while it's cool that this stuff can work: update_post_meta($post->ID, 'key', $_POST['key']);",True,0,0,,"{233372=Use wp_slash() instead of the DB layer in XML-RPC. see #21767., 151623=Props alexkingorg see #21767, 181200=Ã¢Â€Â‹http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/02/17/slashing-insanity/, 222868=Remove dead code.

Dezember 1997 im Freestyle-Skiing-Weltcup, wobei er in Piancavallo auf den vierten Platz sprang und sich sogleich in der Weltspitze etablierte. Er qualifizierte sich fÃƒÂ¼r die Olympischen Winterspiele 1998, bei denen ein achter Platz resultierte. Der erste Podestplatz folgte am 7. MÃƒÂ¤rz 1998 in Hasliberg. Die ersten beiden Weltcupsiege konnte er am 11. und 12. September 1999 in Mount Buller feiern. In der Disziplinenwertung der Saison 1999/2000 musste er sich dem Kanadier Nicolas Fontaine um lediglich acht Punkte geschlagen geben., 15342=Bei der Weltmeisterschaft 2001 in Whistler gewann Hryschyn die Goldmedaille, vor seinem Landsmann Dsmitryj Daschtschynski. Zum Saisonabschluss folgte der dritte Weltcupsieg. Wiederum verpasste er den Gewinn der Disziplinenwertung nur knapp. Ein weiterer Sieg kam in der Saison 2001/02 hinzu. Bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2002 gewann Hryschyn hinter dem US-Amerikaner Eric Bergoust und dem Tschechen AleÃ…Â¡ Valenta die Bronzemedaille. In der Saison 2002/03 blieb er ohne Sieg, holte sich aber bei der Weltmeisterschaft 2003 in Deer Valley die Silbermedaille (wobei die Differenz zum siegreichen Russen Dmitri Archipow weniger als zwei Punkte betrug)., 17675=Im Dezember 2008 gelang Hryschyn nach ÃƒÂ¼ber viereinhalb Jahren wieder ein Weltcupsieg. Allerdings fielen seine Leistungen in der Folge markant ab. Zwar erzielte er in der Saison 2009/10 erneut einen Podestplatz, doch gehÃƒÂ¶rte er vor den Olympischen Winterspielen 2010 nicht zum engeren Favoritenkreis. Beim olympischen Springen in Cypress Mountain zeigte er seine beste Leistung seit lÃƒÂ¤ngerer Zeit und gewann etwas unerwartet die Goldmedaille.

This will allow airside connections from Terminals 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 to the Tom Bradley International Terminal. An additional security checkpoint will be available in this connector to allow passengers to enter Terminal 4 after arriving on an international arrival in the Tom Bradley Terminal avoiding the main Terminal 4 security screening area, also allowing easier connections to Terminal 5, 6, 7 and 8.[36], 51190=At 12:51Ã‚Â pm on Friday, September 21, 2012, a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at LAX on runway 25L.[29] An estimate of over 10,000 people saw the shuttle land in person. Interstate 105 was backed up for miles at a standstill. Imperial Highway was shut down for spectators. Along the way the shuttle passed many landmarks in the Los Angeles area including the Santa Monica Pier, Getty Center, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Griffith Observatory, Malibu coastline, the Hollywood Sign, Universal Studios Hollywood, the Disneyland Resort, and Los Angeles City Hall. It was quickly taken off the Boeing 747 and was moved to a United Airlines hangar. The shuttle spent about a month in the hangar while it was prepared for transport to the California Science Center., 209372=The airport handled 28,861,477 enplanements, the total number of passengers boarding an aircraft, in 2008. This makes LAX the third busiest airport in the United States in terms of enplanements.[95], 77489=Terminal 7 has 11 gates: Gates 70A-70B, 71A-71B, 72, 73, 74, 75A-75B, 76, and 77. This terminal opened in 1962 and was expanded to accommodate widebody aircraft in 1970.[49] The terminal was expanded in 1982 with the addition of a connector building, which today compromises of gates 70A-70B and 71A-71B.[49] Four of these gates have two jetways, which accommodate large aircraft. TerminalÃ‚Â 7 is used for United Airlines' domestic and international operations. The interior of the terminal was renovated between January 1998 and June 1999 at a cost of $250 million, was designed by HNTB, and was constructed by Hensel Phelps Construction. Added were new gate podiums, increased size of gate areas, relocated concessions, expanded restrooms, new flooring, and new signage.[51] Also, the roof of the terminal was raised, and new, brighter light fixtures were added in order to provide more overall lighting.[52] As of 2012, Terminal 7 is undergoing another facelift, with significant changes to concessions. The terminal also contains a United Club and an International First Class Lounge. The terminal has a customs area located on the arrivals floor, used by international flights served by United Airlines., 91267=On March 25, 2007, Runway 7R/25L reopened after being shifted 55 feet (17Ã‚Â m) south to prevent runway incursions and prepare the runway for the Airbus A380. Additional storm drains and enhanced runway lighting were added. Runway 25L is now 800 feet (240Ã‚Â m) south of the parallel runway centerline to centerline, allowing a parallel taxiway between the runways; the taxiway was completed in 2008., 38957=In 1981, LAX began a $700 million expansion in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics. The U-shaped roadway past the terminal entrances got a second level, with arriving passengers on the lower level and departing on the upper. Connector buildings between the ticketing areas and the satellite buildings were added, changing the layout to a ""pier"" design. Two new terminals (Terminal 1 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal) were built and Terminal 2, then two decades old, was rebuilt. Multi-story parking structures were also built in the center of the airport.[10], 75991=In April 2011, Alaska Airlines agreed to a deal with Los Angeles World Airports to renovate TerminalÃ‚Â 6 and build an Alaska Airlines Board Room Lounge. The airline moved its flights to TerminalÃ‚Â 6 on March 20, 2012, and Spirit Airlines was relocated to Terminal 3.[50] US Airways moved operations to Terminal 6 on November 6, 2014.[46], 242275=In June 2014, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a $200 million Metro Rail infill station at Aviation Boulevard and 96th Street on the under construction Crenshaw/LAX Line to connect to an automated people mover (APM) system called the Airport Metro Connector , connecting terminals 1Ã¢Â€Â“8 to the light rail system.[108] The people mover will have six stations: three serving the terminal area, one serving a ground transportation hub, one serving the infill light rail station, and one serving a rental car hub, decreasing the need for shuttle bus services. Construction, estimated to cost $1.5 billion, is planned to start in early 2017 and to be completed by early 2024.[109][110] Currently, shuttle bus ""G"" runs every 10Ã¢Â€Â“15 minutes (synched with the train schedule) from 5Ã‚Â amÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ 1:30Ã‚Â am.[111], 18839=LAX is one of the few airports in North America with direct scheduled service to all six inhabited continents, the others being John F. Kennedy International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport (starting in December 2015), and Toronto Pearson International Airport., 240348=The FlyAway Bus is a motorcoach shuttle service run by the LAWA, which currently travels between one of three off-airport areas: San Fernando Valley (Van Nuys), downtown Los Angeles (Union Station), and the Westside (Westwood). The Irvine FlyAway was discontinued on August 31, 2012. The shuttle service stops at every LAX terminal. The service hours vary based on the line. All lines use the regional system of High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to expedite their trips., 74623=Terminal 6 has 14 gates: Gates 60Ã¢Â€Â“63, 64AÃ¢Â€Â“64B, 65A-65B, 66, 67, 68AÃ¢Â€Â“68B, and 69AÃ¢Â€Â“69B. Parts of this terminal have changed little from its opening in 1961; in 1970, new gates were expanded from the main building, as is obvious from the rotunda at the end. Four of these gates have two jetways, which can accommodate large aircraft. An expansion of the terminal, including a connector of the original satellite to the ticketing areas, was completed in 1987.[49], 92914=On August 15, 2007, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $1.2 billion project to construct a new 10-gate terminal to handle international flights using the Airbus A380.[57] Adding the first new gates built since the early 1980s, the new structure was to be built directly west of the Tom Bradley International Terminal on a site that was occupied mostly by aircraft hangars.[57], 89708=On September 18, 2013, the new Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX officially opened. Airlines started to use the new, smarter gates that can handle larger aircraft, with multiple gates configured for the Airbus A380. Inside, Southern California scenes and eccentric videos are played on seven huge multimedia screens. It is the largest immersive system in an airport and the most advanced multimedia environment in a North American airport. This system was created by Moment Factory.[54] Lounge-like seating for relaxation, and the 25,000-square-foot duty-free shopping area are located in the Great Hall. Many restaurants and high-end shops are located there, such as ChloÃƒÂ©, Burberry, Fred Segal, and Porsche amongst others. Franchises of popular LA restaurants including Umami Burger, 800 Degrees, Larder, Ink.Sack and Lucky Fish are among the restaurant selections available.[55], 34992=The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed 66 weekday departures on United Airlines, 32 American Airlines, 32 Western Airlines, 27 TWA, nine Southwest, five Bonanza Air Lines and three Mexicana Airlines; also 22 flights a week on Pan American World Airways and five a week on Scandinavian Airlines (the only direct flights from California to Europe)., 54338=The distinctive white googie ""Theme Building"", designed by Pereira & Luckman architect Paul Williams and constructed in 1961 by Robert E. McKee Construction Co., resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. A restaurant with a sweeping view of the airport is suspended beneath two arches that form the legs. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1992. A $4 million renovation, with retro-futuristic interior and electric lighting designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, was completed before the ""Encounter Restaurant"" opened there in 1997.[30] Visitors are able to take the elevator up to the roof of the ""Theme Building"", which closed after the September 11, 2001 attacks for security reasons and reopened to the public on weekends beginning on July 10, 2010.[31] Additionally, a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks is located on the grounds, as three of the four hijacked planes were originally destined for LAX.[32], 91798=On September 18, 2006, Los Angeles World Airports started a $503 million facelift of the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Improvements included new paging, air conditioning and electrical systems, along with new elevators, escalators, baggage carousels, and a digital sign that automatically update flight information. With federal funding, explosives-detection technology was incorporated into the terminal's underground baggage system., 88035=In 2010, modernization efforts resulted in additional space for inline baggage screening, three large alliance-aligned lounges plus one unaffiliated lounge (to replace the multiple airline specific lounges) and cosmetic upgrades in the departures and arrivals areas., 40806=In 1996, a $29 million, 277-foot-tall (84Ã‚Â m) air traffic control tower was built near the Theme Building.[10], 53064=On Friday, October 12, Endeavour left the hangar at 2:00Ã‚Â a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and moved eastward on Manchester Boulevard on its way to the California Science Center. The shuttle transport vehicle (STV) was constructed of over 60 individual wheels and weighed over 12,000 pounds (5,400Ã‚Â kg). It was designed to move the shuttle at a speed of 2 miles per hour (3.2Ã‚Â km/h). This was both for safety concerns for the shuttle and so people could take many photos. As the entire planned route was only 12 miles, it should have only taken 6 hours to complete. Instead, the shuttle arrived in one piece on the morning of Sunday, October 14, 2012., 254175=Continental Airlines once had its corporate headquarters on the airport property. At a 1962 press conference in the office of Mayor of Los Angeles Sam Yorty, Continental Airlines announced that it planned to move its headquarters to Los Angeles in July 1963.[118] In 1963 Continental's headquarters moved to a two-story, $2.3 million building on the grounds of the airport.[119][120] The July 2009 Continental Magazine issue stated that the move ""underlined Continental's western and Pacific orientation"".[121] On July 1, 1983 the airline's headquarters were relocated to the America Tower in the Neartown area of Houston.[122], 34521=On July 10, 1956, Boeing's 707 prototype (the 367Ã¢Â€Â“80) visited LAX. The Los Angeles Times said it was its first appearance at a ""commercial airport"" outside the Seattle area.[15], 69768=Terminal 4 has 14 gates: Gates 40Ã¢Â€Â“41, 42AÃ¢Â€Â“42B, 43Ã¢Â€Â“45 (Gate 44 is for the bus to the American Eagle remote terminal, Gates 44A-44J), 46AÃ¢Â€Â“46B, 47AÃ¢Â€Â“47B, 48AÃ¢Â€Â“48B, and 49A, and houses American Airlines flights. TerminalÃ‚Â 4 was built in 1961, was expanded in 1983 by adding a connector from the ticketing areas to the original satellite,[42] and was renovated in 2002 at a cost of $400 million in order to improve the appearance and functionality of the facility. The renovation was designed by Rivers & Christian.[47] An international arrivals facility was also added as part of the renovations., 63560=Terminal 2 was built in 1962, and was the original international terminal. It was completely torn down and rebuilt in stages between 1984 and 1988 at a cost of $94 million.[38] The rebuilt terminal was designed by Leo A Daly.[39] TerminalÃ‚Â 2 has CBP (Customs and Border Protection) facilities to process arriving international passengers., 36346=In 1958, the architecture firm Pereira & Luckman was contracted to plan the re-design of the airport for the ""jet age"". The plan, developed with architects Welton Becket and Paul Williams, called for a series of terminals and parking structures in the central portion of the property, with these buildings connected at the center by a huge steel-and-glass dome. The plan was never realized, and the Theme Building was built on the site intended for the dome., 88871=On February 22, 2010, construction began on the $1.5 billion Bradley West project, part of the multi-year $4.11 billion LAX improvement and redevelopment projects. The project added over 1,250,000 square feet (116,000Ã‚Â m2) of shops, restaurants, and passenger lounges, as well as new security screening, customs, immigration, and baggage claim facilities. The terminal's existing two concourses will be demolished and replaced with a larger pair with 18 gates, nine of which will be able to accommodate the Airbus A380. The terminal opened in phases beginning on September 2012, and was completed in 2014.[53], 250030=The museum has on display ""The Spirit of Seventy-Six,"" which is a DC-3 (DC-3-262, Serial No. 3269). After being in commercial airline service, the plane served as a corporate aircraft for Union Oil Company for 32 years. The plane was built in the Douglas Aircraft Company plant in Santa Monica in January 1941, which was a major producer of both commercial and military aircraft.[115], 47171=In 2008 plans were unveiled for a $4.11 billion renovation and improvement program to expand and rehabilitate the Tom Bradley International Terminal to accommodate the next generation of larger aircraft, as well as handle the growing number of flights to and from the Southern California region, and to develop the Central Terminal Area (CTA) of the airport to include streamlined passenger processing, public transportation and updated central utility plants.[24] As of 2013, Los Angeles International Airport is the biggest airport in California. The multi-year project, originally projected to be completed in 2014, is ongoing as of February 2015,[25] and is the largest public works project in Los Angeles history.[26][27], 283805=Numerous films and television shows have been set or filmed partially at LAX, at least partly due to the airport's proximity to Hollywood studios. Film shoots at the Los Angeles airports, including LAX, produced $590 million for the Los Angeles region from 2002 to 2005.[155], 96567=Asiana Airlines launched an Airbus A380 service to LAX on Wednesday, August 20, 2014. This new A380 route makes Asiana the eighth A380 operator at LAX and the eleventh airline to operate an A380. Previously, Asiana deployed regional Asian A380 routes to Osaka, Hong Kong, and Bangkok.[61], 39754=On July 8, 1982, groundbreaking for the two new terminals were conducted by Mayor Tom Bradley and World War II aviator General James Doolittle. The $123 million 963,000-square-foot (89,500Ã‚Â m2) International Terminal opened on June 11, 1984, and was named for Bradley.[10], 79692=Terminal 8 has 9 gates: Gates 80Ã¢Â€Â“88. This terminal was originally constructed in 1961 as Concourse 8 and was redeveloped in 1982 and renamed Terminal 8.[49] The terminal formerly served Shuttle by United flights. While at one point, United solely operated United Express flights from Terminal 8 and operated non-Express flights from Terminals 6 andÃ‚Â 7, TerminalÃ‚Â 8 is now used once again for some mainline flights., 44903=It is illegal[dubious Ã¢Â€Â“ discuss] to limit the number of passengers that use an airport, but in December 2005 the city agreed to limit the passenger gates to 163. Once passenger usage hits 75 million, a maximum of two gates a year for up to five years will be closed, intending to limit growth to 79 million passengers a year. In exchange civil lawsuits were abandoned, to allow the city to complete badly needed improvements to the airport.[21], 211773=The number of aircraft operations (landings and takeoffs) has steadily increased to 636,706 in 2014, up from 614,917 in 2013, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.[101] The Airports Council International places LAX at third most aircraft movements in the world, as of 2013.[102], 15717=In 2014, LAX handled 70,622,212 passengers, far exceeding a previous record of 67.3 million travelers set in 2000.[4] The airport holds the claim for ""the world's busiest origin and destination (O & D) airport"" in 2011, meaning it had the most non-connecting passengers.[5] The airport also was the third busiest in the world by aircraft movements. It is also the only airport to rank among the top five U.S. airports for both passenger and cargo traffic.[6], 37235=In the new terminal area west of Sepulveda Blvd that started opening in 1961, each terminal had a satellite building out in the middle of the tarmac, reached by underground tunnels from the ticketing area.[16] United's satellites 7 and 8 were first to open, followed by 3, 4 and 5; satellite 2 opened as the international terminal several months later and satellite 6 was to be the last to open.[17][18], 88314=On November 17, 2008, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa unveiled design concepts for LAX's Bradley West and Midfield Concourse projects. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), along with city officials, selected Fentress Architects in association with HNTB to develop a design concept for the modernization of LAX. The emphasis of the modernization is to improve the passenger experience and to keep Los Angeles competitive with other global cities., 35977=American Airlines' 707-123s flew the first jet passengers out of LAX to New York in January 1959; the first wide-body jets were TWA's Boeing 747s to New York in early 1970.[10], 75368=Continental Airlines originally built the Connector Building (which links the Ticketing and rotunda buildings). Prior to October 2014, United Airlines used the connector gates, supplementing its base at TerminalÃ‚Â 7. Delta also leases some space from the Airport in TerminalÃ‚Â 6, in addition to its base at TerminalÃ‚Â 5. Most of the rotunda gates can feed arriving passengers into a sterile corridor that shunts them to TerminalÃ‚Â 7's customs and immigration facility., 32606=Mines Field opened as the airport of Los Angeles in 1930 and the city purchased it to be a municipal airfield in 1937. The name became Los Angeles Airport in 1941 and Los Angeles International Airport in 1949.[10] In the 1930s the main airline airports were Burbank Airport (then known as Union Air Terminal, and later Lockheed) in Burbank and the Grand Central Airport in Glendale. (In 1940 the airlines were all at Burbank except for Mexicana's three departures a week from Glendale; in late 1946 most airline flights moved to LAX, but Burbank always retained a few.)[11], 31369=In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council selected 640 acres (1.00Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi; 260Ã‚Â ha) in the southern part of Westchester for a new airport for the city. The fields of wheat, barley and lima beans were converted into dirt landing strips without any terminal buildings. It was named Mines Field for William W. Mines, the real estate agent who arranged the deal.[8] The first structure, Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929 and is in the National Register of Historic Places.[9], 44235=Starting in the mid-1990s, under Mayors Richard Riordan and James Hahn, modernization and expansion plans for LAX were prepared, only to be stymied by a coalition of residents who live near the airport. They cited increased noise, pollution and traffic impacts of the project. In late 2005, newly elected Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was able to reach a compromise, allowing some modernization to go forward while encouraging future growth among other facilities in the region., 97028=As of 29 March 2015[update], LAX has more A380 services than any other North American city, with twelve daily flights spread among nine operators: Emirates (Dubai), China Southern Airlines (Guangzhou), British Airways (London), Qantas (Sydney and Melbourne), Korean Air and Asiana Airlines (Seoul), Air France (Paris), Singapore Airlines (Singapore via Tokyo), and Lufthansa (Frankfurt)., 33526=Mines Field did not extend west of Sepulveda Boulevard;[12] Sepulveda was rerouted circa 1950 to loop around the west ends of the extended eastÃ¢Â€Â“west runways (now runways 25L and 25R), which by November 1950 were 6,000 feet (1,800Ã‚Â m) long.[13] A tunnel was completed in 1953 allowing Sepulveda Boulevard to revert to straight and pass beneath the two runways; it was the first tunnel of its kind. For the next few years the two runways were 8,500 feet (2,600Ã‚Â m) long.[10][14], 76713=Former tenants of the terminal include Continental Airlines until its merger with United in 2011 and Eastern Air Lines, which went bankrupt in 1991. The terminal also originally housed Pacific Southwest Airlines., 66274=Terminal 3 has 12 gates: Gates 30, 31AÃ¢Â€Â“31B, 32, 33AÃ¢Â€Â“33B, 34Ã¢Â€Â“36, 37AÃ¢Â€Â“37B, and 38 (gate 39 was removed to make room for Virgin Australia Boeing 777 operations at gate 38). Terminal 3 opened in 1961 and was Trans World Airlines' terminal. The terminal was expanded in 1970 to accommodate widebody operations and between 1980 and 1987, which included a new passenger connector building and baggage system connected to the original satellite.[42] It formerly housed some American Airlines flights after that airline acquired Reno Air and TWA in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Eventually, all American flights were moved to TerminalÃ‚Â 4. As of November 2014, Allegiant Air,[43] BizAir Shuttle operated by Ultimate Air Shuttle,[44] Frontier Airlines,[45] JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, and Virgin America use TerminalÃ‚Â 3. US Airways moved operations to Terminal 6 on November 6, 2014.[46], 94188=On March 31, 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that foreign carriers were once again flocking to LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal. The weaker dollar caused a surge in demand for U.S. travel, resulting in airlines either adding new destinations or increasing frequencies to existing routes. New airlines that introduced flights to LAX included Virgin Australia, Emirates Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and Iberia Airlines. Korean Air, Qantas, Air China, and Air France. The influx of new flights comes amidst the renovation of the airport and consolidates LAX's status as the premiere international gateway to the Western United States.[59], 72167=Terminal 5 has 15 gates: Gates 50AÃ¢Â€Â“50B, 51AÃ¢Â€Â“51B, 52AÃ¢Â€Â“52B, 53AÃ¢Â€Â“53B, 54AÃ¢Â€Â“54B, 55A, 56Ã¢Â€Â“57, 58, and 59, and is used for Delta Air Lines flights. Western Airlines occupied this terminal at its opening in 1962, and continued to do so until Western was merged with Delta on April 1, 1987. TerminalÃ‚Â 5 was redesigned by Gensler,[48] expanded to include a connector building between the original satellite and the ticketing facilities and remodeled from 1986 through early 1988. It was unofficially named 'Delta's Oasis at LAX' with the slogan 'Take Five at LAX' when construction was completed in the summer of 1988. Northwest Airlines moved all operations to TerminalÃ‚Â 5 and TerminalÃ‚Â 6 alongside Delta on June 30, 2009, as part of its merger with the airline. The terminal has a customs area in the arrivals floor, used for international flights served by Delta Air Lines., 92333=According to the Los Angeles Times, in February 2007, many Pacific Rim carriers began reducing flights to LAX in favor of more modern airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, due to the aging Tom Bradley International Terminal.[56], 126461=American Airlines/American Eagle operate the most departures from the airport, followed by United Airlines/United Express and Southwest Airlines. American operates the largest network of routes out of LAX serving 62 destinations, followed closely by Delta (58) and United (57). American (from December 17, 2015), Delta and United all operate nonstop services to the most transpacific destinations (four). Norwegian Air Shuttle (Operated by Norwegian Long Haul) serves the most destinations in Europe (three), while Alaska Airlines/Horizon serve the most destinations in Mexico (eight). This table lists passenger flights served with a nonstop or direct flight with no change of aircraft carrying passengers originating in Los Angeles according to the airlines' published schedules, unless otherwise noted., 93552=On March 19, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its debut at LAX, landing on runway 24L. Though LAX was originally to be the first U.S. city to see the A380, Airbus later decided to forgo LAX in favor of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. After city officials fought for the super-jumbo jet to land at LAX, Airbus had to get two A380s, where they A380 landed simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles.[58], 87436=This terminal opened for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games and is named for Tom Bradley, the first African-American and longest-serving (20 years) mayor of Los Angeles, and champion of LAX. The terminal is located at the west end of the passenger terminal area between TerminalsÃ‚Â 3 andÃ‚Â 4. Tom Bradley International Terminal hosts 29 airlines and handles 10 million passengers per year., 40624=The airport closed again on January 17, 1994 after the Northridge earthquake., 42091=In 2000, before Los Angeles hosted the Democratic National Convention, fifteen glass pylons up to ten stories high were placed in a circle around the intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and Century Boulevard, with more pylons of decreasing height following Century Boulevard eastward, evoking a sense of departure and arrival. Conceived by the designers at Selbert Perkins Design, the towers and 30-foot (9.1Ã‚Â m) ""LAX"" letters are a gateway to the airport and offer a welcoming landmark for visitors.[19] Illuminated from the inside, the pylons slowly cycle through a rainbow of colors that represents the multicultural makeup of Los Angeles and can be customized to celebrate events, holidays or a season. This was part of an overall face-lift that included new signage and various other cosmetic enhancements that was led by Ted Tokio Tanaka Architects. The LAX pylons underwent improvements in 2006, as stage lighting inside the cylinders was replaced with LED lights to conserve energy, make maintenance easier and enable on-demand cycling through various color effects.[20], 246500=The Coast Guard is planning to close Coast Guard Air Station Los Angeles and move its aircraft and personnel to Naval Air Station Point Mugu, part of Naval Base Ventura County in Oxnard, California, when the lease on the existing facility ends in 2016.[112][113], 210899=In terms of international passengers, as of 2012, LAX is the third busiest in the United States. (behind JFK in New York City and MIA in Miami)[99] and, as of 2006, 26th worldwide.[100], 209683=It is the world's fifth-busiest airport by passenger traffic[96] and fifteenth-busiest by cargo traffic,[97] serving over 70.6 million passengers and 2 million tons of freight and mail in 2014. It is the busiest airport in the state of California, and the second-busiest airport by passenger boardings in the United States, based on final 2013 statistics.[98], 64165=Former tenants of the terminal include Air China, Air New Zealand, Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, and TACA International Airlines. Air New Zealand moved to the Tom Bradley International Terminal on December 3, 2014[40] and Air China moved to the Tom Bradley International Terminal on July 1, 2015.[41], 95433=Qantas launched service with the Airbus A380 on October 20, 2008, using the west side remote gates. Though initially deployed between LAX and Sydney, Qantas' A380 service was extended to the LAX-Melbourne route. This was followed shortly by Korean Air, which initiated nonstop A380 flights to Seoul-Incheon in October 2011. Air France has launched A380 flights between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Los Angeles in May 2012. In addition, China Southern Airlines launched A380 service to Guangzhou in October 2012, representing an increase in capacity of 78% on the route. With the addition of these services, LAX boasted six daily A380 services. On October 15, British Airways' nonstop service from London Heathrow to LAX also became an A380 route.[60], 61004=Terminal 1 has 15 gates: Gates 1Ã¢Â€Â“3, 4AÃ¢Â€Â“4B, and 5Ã¢Â€Â“14 (re numbered to 9, 10, 11A-11B, 12A-12B, 13-15, 16A-16B, 17A-17B, and 18A-18B, as of mid-May 2015), and houses Southwest Airlines. Terminal 1 was built in 1984. Terminal 1 is presently undergoing an extensive renovation financed by Southwest Airlines. This renovation will continue through 2018 and provide updates to security screening area, curbside dropoff, terminal areas and baggage handling.[37], 48748=Before the 1930s, existing airports used a two-letter abbreviation based on the weather stations at the airports. At that time, ""LA"" served as the designation for Los Angeles Airport. But with the rapid growth in the aviation industry the designations expanded to three letters c. 1947, and ""LA"" became ""LAX."" The letter ""X"" has no specific meaning in this identifier.[28] ""LAX"" is also used for the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro and by Amtrak for Union Station in downtown Los Angeles., 40340=On April 29, 1992, the airport closed for violence and cleanup after the 1992 Los Angeles Riots over the Rodney King beating.}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 22:41:55 GMT"

This will allow airside connections from Terminals 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 to the Tom Bradley International Terminal. An additional security checkpoint will be available in this connector to allow passengers to enter Terminal 4 after arriving on an international arrival in the Tom Bradley Terminal avoiding the main Terminal 4 security screening area, also allowing easier connections to Terminal 5, 6, 7 and 8.[36], 51190=At 12:51Ã‚Â pm on Friday, September 21, 2012, a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at LAX on runway 25L.[29] An estimate of over 10,000 people saw the shuttle land in person. Interstate 105 was backed up for miles at a standstill. Imperial Highway was shut down for spectators. Along the way the shuttle passed many landmarks in the Los Angeles area including the Santa Monica Pier, Getty Center, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Griffith Observatory, Malibu coastline, the Hollywood Sign, Universal Studios Hollywood, the Disneyland Resort, and Los Angeles City Hall. It was quickly taken off the Boeing 747 and was moved to a United Airlines hangar. The shuttle spent about a month in the hangar while it was prepared for transport to the California Science Center., 209372=The airport handled 28,861,477 enplanements, the total number of passengers boarding an aircraft, in 2008. This makes LAX the third busiest airport in the United States in terms of enplanements.[95], 77489=Terminal 7 has 11 gates: Gates 70A-70B, 71A-71B, 72, 73, 74, 75A-75B, 76, and 77. This terminal opened in 1962 and was expanded to accommodate widebody aircraft in 1970.[49] The terminal was expanded in 1982 with the addition of a connector building, which today compromises of gates 70A-70B and 71A-71B.[49] Four of these gates have two jetways, which accommodate large aircraft. TerminalÃ‚Â 7 is used for United Airlines' domestic and international operations. The interior of the terminal was renovated between January 1998 and June 1999 at a cost of $250 million, was designed by HNTB, and was constructed by Hensel Phelps Construction. Added were new gate podiums, increased size of gate areas, relocated concessions, expanded restrooms, new flooring, and new signage.[51] Also, the roof of the terminal was raised, and new, brighter light fixtures were added in order to provide more overall lighting.[52] As of 2012, Terminal 7 is undergoing another facelift, with significant changes to concessions. The terminal also contains a United Club and an International First Class Lounge. The terminal has a customs area located on the arrivals floor, used by international flights served by United Airlines., 91267=On March 25, 2007, Runway 7R/25L reopened after being shifted 55 feet (17Ã‚Â m) south to prevent runway incursions and prepare the runway for the Airbus A380. Additional storm drains and enhanced runway lighting were added. Runway 25L is now 800 feet (240Ã‚Â m) south of the parallel runway centerline to centerline, allowing a parallel taxiway between the runways; the taxiway was completed in 2008., 38957=In 1981, LAX began a $700 million expansion in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics. The U-shaped roadway past the terminal entrances got a second level, with arriving passengers on the lower level and departing on the upper. Connector buildings between the ticketing areas and the satellite buildings were added, changing the layout to a ""pier"" design. Two new terminals (Terminal 1 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal) were built and Terminal 2, then two decades old, was rebuilt. Multi-story parking structures were also built in the center of the airport.[10], 75991=In April 2011, Alaska Airlines agreed to a deal with Los Angeles World Airports to renovate TerminalÃ‚Â 6 and build an Alaska Airlines Board Room Lounge. The airline moved its flights to TerminalÃ‚Â 6 on March 20, 2012, and Spirit Airlines was relocated to Terminal 3.[50] US Airways moved operations to Terminal 6 on November 6, 2014.[46], 242275=In June 2014, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a $200 million Metro Rail infill station at Aviation Boulevard and 96th Street on the under construction Crenshaw/LAX Line to connect to an automated people mover (APM) system called the Airport Metro Connector , connecting terminals 1Ã¢Â€Â“8 to the light rail system.[108] The people mover will have six stations: three serving the terminal area, one serving a ground transportation hub, one serving the infill light rail station, and one serving a rental car hub, decreasing the need for shuttle bus services. Construction, estimated to cost $1.5 billion, is planned to start in early 2017 and to be completed by early 2024.[109][110] Currently, shuttle bus ""G"" runs every 10Ã¢Â€Â“15 minutes (synched with the train schedule) from 5Ã‚Â amÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ 1:30Ã‚Â am.[111], 18839=LAX is one of the few airports in North America with direct scheduled service to all six inhabited continents, the others being John F. Kennedy International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport (starting in December 2015), and Toronto Pearson International Airport., 240348=The FlyAway Bus is a motorcoach shuttle service run by the LAWA, which currently travels between one of three off-airport areas: San Fernando Valley (Van Nuys), downtown Los Angeles (Union Station), and the Westside (Westwood). The Irvine FlyAway was discontinued on August 31, 2012. The shuttle service stops at every LAX terminal. The service hours vary based on the line. All lines use the regional system of High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to expedite their trips., 74623=Terminal 6 has 14 gates: Gates 60Ã¢Â€Â“63, 64AÃ¢Â€Â“64B, 65A-65B, 66, 67, 68AÃ¢Â€Â“68B, and 69AÃ¢Â€Â“69B. Parts of this terminal have changed little from its opening in 1961; in 1970, new gates were expanded from the main building, as is obvious from the rotunda at the end. Four of these gates have two jetways, which can accommodate large aircraft. An expansion of the terminal, including a connector of the original satellite to the ticketing areas, was completed in 1987.[49], 92914=On August 15, 2007, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $1.2 billion project to construct a new 10-gate terminal to handle international flights using the Airbus A380.[57] Adding the first new gates built since the early 1980s, the new structure was to be built directly west of the Tom Bradley International Terminal on a site that was occupied mostly by aircraft hangars.[57], 89708=On September 18, 2013, the new Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX officially opened. Airlines started to use the new, smarter gates that can handle larger aircraft, with multiple gates configured for the Airbus A380. Inside, Southern California scenes and eccentric videos are played on seven huge multimedia screens. It is the largest immersive system in an airport and the most advanced multimedia environment in a North American airport. This system was created by Moment Factory.[54] Lounge-like seating for relaxation, and the 25,000-square-foot duty-free shopping area are located in the Great Hall. Many restaurants and high-end shops are located there, such as ChloÃƒÂ©, Burberry, Fred Segal, and Porsche amongst others. Franchises of popular LA restaurants including Umami Burger, 800 Degrees, Larder, Ink.Sack and Lucky Fish are among the restaurant selections available.[55], 34992=The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed 66 weekday departures on United Airlines, 32 American Airlines, 32 Western Airlines, 27 TWA, nine Southwest, five Bonanza Air Lines and three Mexicana Airlines; also 22 flights a week on Pan American World Airways and five a week on Scandinavian Airlines (the only direct flights from California to Europe)., 54338=The distinctive white googie ""Theme Building"", designed by Pereira & Luckman architect Paul Williams and constructed in 1961 by Robert E. McKee Construction Co., resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. A restaurant with a sweeping view of the airport is suspended beneath two arches that form the legs. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1992. A $4 million renovation, with retro-futuristic interior and electric lighting designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, was completed before the ""Encounter Restaurant"" opened there in 1997.[30] Visitors are able to take the elevator up to the roof of the ""Theme Building"", which closed after the September 11, 2001 attacks for security reasons and reopened to the public on weekends beginning on July 10, 2010.[31] Additionally, a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks is located on the grounds, as three of the four hijacked planes were originally destined for LAX.[32], 91798=On September 18, 2006, Los Angeles World Airports started a $503 million facelift of the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Improvements included new paging, air conditioning and electrical systems, along with new elevators, escalators, baggage carousels, and a digital sign that automatically update flight information. With federal funding, explosives-detection technology was incorporated into the terminal's underground baggage system., 88035=In 2010, modernization efforts resulted in additional space for inline baggage screening, three large alliance-aligned lounges plus one unaffiliated lounge (to replace the multiple airline specific lounges) and cosmetic upgrades in the departures and arrivals areas., 40806=In 1996, a $29 million, 277-foot-tall (84Ã‚Â m) air traffic control tower was built near the Theme Building.[10], 53064=On Friday, October 12, Endeavour left the hangar at 2:00Ã‚Â a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and moved eastward on Manchester Boulevard on its way to the California Science Center. The shuttle transport vehicle (STV) was constructed of over 60 individual wheels and weighed over 12,000 pounds (5,400Ã‚Â kg). It was designed to move the shuttle at a speed of 2 miles per hour (3.2Ã‚Â km/h). This was both for safety concerns for the shuttle and so people could take many photos. As the entire planned route was only 12 miles, it should have only taken 6 hours to complete. Instead, the shuttle arrived in one piece on the morning of Sunday, October 14, 2012., 254175=Continental Airlines once had its corporate headquarters on the airport property. At a 1962 press conference in the office of Mayor of Los Angeles Sam Yorty, Continental Airlines announced that it planned to move its headquarters to Los Angeles in July 1963.[118] In 1963 Continental's headquarters moved to a two-story, $2.3 million building on the grounds of the airport.[119][120] The July 2009 Continental Magazine issue stated that the move ""underlined Continental's western and Pacific orientation"".[121] On July 1, 1983 the airline's headquarters were relocated to the America Tower in the Neartown area of Houston.[122], 34521=On July 10, 1956, Boeing's 707 prototype (the 367Ã¢Â€Â“80) visited LAX. The Los Angeles Times said it was its first appearance at a ""commercial airport"" outside the Seattle area.[15], 69768=Terminal 4 has 14 gates: Gates 40Ã¢Â€Â“41, 42AÃ¢Â€Â“42B, 43Ã¢Â€Â“45 (Gate 44 is for the bus to the American Eagle remote terminal, Gates 44A-44J), 46AÃ¢Â€Â“46B, 47AÃ¢Â€Â“47B, 48AÃ¢Â€Â“48B, and 49A, and houses American Airlines flights. TerminalÃ‚Â 4 was built in 1961, was expanded in 1983 by adding a connector from the ticketing areas to the original satellite,[42] and was renovated in 2002 at a cost of $400 million in order to improve the appearance and functionality of the facility. The renovation was designed by Rivers & Christian.[47] An international arrivals facility was also added as part of the renovations., 63560=Terminal 2 was built in 1962, and was the original international terminal. It was completely torn down and rebuilt in stages between 1984 and 1988 at a cost of $94 million.[38] The rebuilt terminal was designed by Leo A Daly.[39] TerminalÃ‚Â 2 has CBP (Customs and Border Protection) facilities to process arriving international passengers., 36346=In 1958, the architecture firm Pereira & Luckman was contracted to plan the re-design of the airport for the ""jet age"". The plan, developed with architects Welton Becket and Paul Williams, called for a series of terminals and parking structures in the central portion of the property, with these buildings connected at the center by a huge steel-and-glass dome. The plan was never realized, and the Theme Building was built on the site intended for the dome., 88871=On February 22, 2010, construction began on the $1.5 billion Bradley West project, part of the multi-year $4.11 billion LAX improvement and redevelopment projects. The project added over 1,250,000 square feet (116,000Ã‚Â m2) of shops, restaurants, and passenger lounges, as well as new security screening, customs, immigration, and baggage claim facilities. The terminal's existing two concourses will be demolished and replaced with a larger pair with 18 gates, nine of which will be able to accommodate the Airbus A380. The terminal opened in phases beginning on September 2012, and was completed in 2014.[53], 250030=The museum has on display ""The Spirit of Seventy-Six,"" which is a DC-3 (DC-3-262, Serial No. 3269). After being in commercial airline service, the plane served as a corporate aircraft for Union Oil Company for 32 years. The plane was built in the Douglas Aircraft Company plant in Santa Monica in January 1941, which was a major producer of both commercial and military aircraft.[115], 47171=In 2008 plans were unveiled for a $4.11 billion renovation and improvement program to expand and rehabilitate the Tom Bradley International Terminal to accommodate the next generation of larger aircraft, as well as handle the growing number of flights to and from the Southern California region, and to develop the Central Terminal Area (CTA) of the airport to include streamlined passenger processing, public transportation and updated central utility plants.[24] As of 2013, Los Angeles International Airport is the biggest airport in California. The multi-year project, originally projected to be completed in 2014, is ongoing as of February 2015,[25] and is the largest public works project in Los Angeles history.[26][27], 283805=Numerous films and television shows have been set or filmed partially at LAX, at least partly due to the airport's proximity to Hollywood studios. Film shoots at the Los Angeles airports, including LAX, produced $590 million for the Los Angeles region from 2002 to 2005.[155], 96567=Asiana Airlines launched an Airbus A380 service to LAX on Wednesday, August 20, 2014. This new A380 route makes Asiana the eighth A380 operator at LAX and the eleventh airline to operate an A380. Previously, Asiana deployed regional Asian A380 routes to Osaka, Hong Kong, and Bangkok.[61], 39754=On July 8, 1982, groundbreaking for the two new terminals were conducted by Mayor Tom Bradley and World War II aviator General James Doolittle. The $123 million 963,000-square-foot (89,500Ã‚Â m2) International Terminal opened on June 11, 1984, and was named for Bradley.[10], 79692=Terminal 8 has 9 gates: Gates 80Ã¢Â€Â“88. This terminal was originally constructed in 1961 as Concourse 8 and was redeveloped in 1982 and renamed Terminal 8.[49] The terminal formerly served Shuttle by United flights. While at one point, United solely operated United Express flights from Terminal 8 and operated non-Express flights from Terminals 6 andÃ‚Â 7, TerminalÃ‚Â 8 is now used once again for some mainline flights., 44903=It is illegal[dubious Ã¢Â€Â“ discuss] to limit the number of passengers that use an airport, but in December 2005 the city agreed to limit the passenger gates to 163. Once passenger usage hits 75 million, a maximum of two gates a year for up to five years will be closed, intending to limit growth to 79 million passengers a year. In exchange civil lawsuits were abandoned, to allow the city to complete badly needed improvements to the airport.[21], 211773=The number of aircraft operations (landings and takeoffs) has steadily increased to 636,706 in 2014, up from 614,917 in 2013, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.[101] The Airports Council International places LAX at third most aircraft movements in the world, as of 2013.[102], 15717=In 2014, LAX handled 70,622,212 passengers, far exceeding a previous record of 67.3 million travelers set in 2000.[4] The airport holds the claim for ""the world's busiest origin and destination (O & D) airport"" in 2011, meaning it had the most non-connecting passengers.[5] The airport also was the third busiest in the world by aircraft movements. It is also the only airport to rank among the top five U.S. airports for both passenger and cargo traffic.[6], 37235=In the new terminal area west of Sepulveda Blvd that started opening in 1961, each terminal had a satellite building out in the middle of the tarmac, reached by underground tunnels from the ticketing area.[16] United's satellites 7 and 8 were first to open, followed by 3, 4 and 5; satellite 2 opened as the international terminal several months later and satellite 6 was to be the last to open.[17][18], 88314=On November 17, 2008, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa unveiled design concepts for LAX's Bradley West and Midfield Concourse projects. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), along with city officials, selected Fentress Architects in association with HNTB to develop a design concept for the modernization of LAX. The emphasis of the modernization is to improve the passenger experience and to keep Los Angeles competitive with other global cities., 35977=American Airlines' 707-123s flew the first jet passengers out of LAX to New York in January 1959; the first wide-body jets were TWA's Boeing 747s to New York in early 1970.[10], 75368=Continental Airlines originally built the Connector Building (which links the Ticketing and rotunda buildings). Prior to October 2014, United Airlines used the connector gates, supplementing its base at TerminalÃ‚Â 7. Delta also leases some space from the Airport in TerminalÃ‚Â 6, in addition to its base at TerminalÃ‚Â 5. Most of the rotunda gates can feed arriving passengers into a sterile corridor that shunts them to TerminalÃ‚Â 7's customs and immigration facility., 32606=Mines Field opened as the airport of Los Angeles in 1930 and the city purchased it to be a municipal airfield in 1937. The name became Los Angeles Airport in 1941 and Los Angeles International Airport in 1949.[10] In the 1930s the main airline airports were Burbank Airport (then known as Union Air Terminal, and later Lockheed) in Burbank and the Grand Central Airport in Glendale. (In 1940 the airlines were all at Burbank except for Mexicana's three departures a week from Glendale; in late 1946 most airline flights moved to LAX, but Burbank always retained a few.)[11], 31369=In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council selected 640 acres (1.00Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi; 260Ã‚Â ha) in the southern part of Westchester for a new airport for the city. The fields of wheat, barley and lima beans were converted into dirt landing strips without any terminal buildings. It was named Mines Field for William W. Mines, the real estate agent who arranged the deal.[8] The first structure, Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929 and is in the National Register of Historic Places.[9], 44235=Starting in the mid-1990s, under Mayors Richard Riordan and James Hahn, modernization and expansion plans for LAX were prepared, only to be stymied by a coalition of residents who live near the airport. They cited increased noise, pollution and traffic impacts of the project. In late 2005, newly elected Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was able to reach a compromise, allowing some modernization to go forward while encouraging future growth among other facilities in the region., 97028=As of 29 March 2015[update], LAX has more A380 services than any other North American city, with twelve daily flights spread among nine operators: Emirates (Dubai), China Southern Airlines (Guangzhou), British Airways (London), Qantas (Sydney and Melbourne), Korean Air and Asiana Airlines (Seoul), Air France (Paris), Singapore Airlines (Singapore via Tokyo), and Lufthansa (Frankfurt)., 33526=Mines Field did not extend west of Sepulveda Boulevard;[12] Sepulveda was rerouted circa 1950 to loop around the west ends of the extended eastÃ¢Â€Â“west runways (now runways 25L and 25R), which by November 1950 were 6,000 feet (1,800Ã‚Â m) long.[13] A tunnel was completed in 1953 allowing Sepulveda Boulevard to revert to straight and pass beneath the two runways; it was the first tunnel of its kind. For the next few years the two runways were 8,500 feet (2,600Ã‚Â m) long.[10][14], 76713=Former tenants of the terminal include Continental Airlines until its merger with United in 2011 and Eastern Air Lines, which went bankrupt in 1991. The terminal also originally housed Pacific Southwest Airlines., 66274=Terminal 3 has 12 gates: Gates 30, 31AÃ¢Â€Â“31B, 32, 33AÃ¢Â€Â“33B, 34Ã¢Â€Â“36, 37AÃ¢Â€Â“37B, and 38 (gate 39 was removed to make room for Virgin Australia Boeing 777 operations at gate 38). Terminal 3 opened in 1961 and was Trans World Airlines' terminal. The terminal was expanded in 1970 to accommodate widebody operations and between 1980 and 1987, which included a new passenger connector building and baggage system connected to the original satellite.[42] It formerly housed some American Airlines flights after that airline acquired Reno Air and TWA in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Eventually, all American flights were moved to TerminalÃ‚Â 4. As of November 2014, Allegiant Air,[43] BizAir Shuttle operated by Ultimate Air Shuttle,[44] Frontier Airlines,[45] JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, and Virgin America use TerminalÃ‚Â 3. US Airways moved operations to Terminal 6 on November 6, 2014.[46], 94188=On March 31, 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that foreign carriers were once again flocking to LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal. The weaker dollar caused a surge in demand for U.S. travel, resulting in airlines either adding new destinations or increasing frequencies to existing routes. New airlines that introduced flights to LAX included Virgin Australia, Emirates Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and Iberia Airlines. Korean Air, Qantas, Air China, and Air France. The influx of new flights comes amidst the renovation of the airport and consolidates LAX's status as the premiere international gateway to the Western United States.[59], 72167=Terminal 5 has 15 gates: Gates 50AÃ¢Â€Â“50B, 51AÃ¢Â€Â“51B, 52AÃ¢Â€Â“52B, 53AÃ¢Â€Â“53B, 54AÃ¢Â€Â“54B, 55A, 56Ã¢Â€Â“57, 58, and 59, and is used for Delta Air Lines flights. Western Airlines occupied this terminal at its opening in 1962, and continued to do so until Western was merged with Delta on April 1, 1987. TerminalÃ‚Â 5 was redesigned by Gensler,[48] expanded to include a connector building between the original satellite and the ticketing facilities and remodeled from 1986 through early 1988. It was unofficially named 'Delta's Oasis at LAX' with the slogan 'Take Five at LAX' when construction was completed in the summer of 1988. Northwest Airlines moved all operations to TerminalÃ‚Â 5 and TerminalÃ‚Â 6 alongside Delta on June 30, 2009, as part of its merger with the airline. The terminal has a customs area in the arrivals floor, used for international flights served by Delta Air Lines., 92333=According to the Los Angeles Times, in February 2007, many Pacific Rim carriers began reducing flights to LAX in favor of more modern airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, due to the aging Tom Bradley International Terminal.[56], 126461=American Airlines/American Eagle operate the most departures from the airport, followed by United Airlines/United Express and Southwest Airlines. American operates the largest network of routes out of LAX serving 62 destinations, followed closely by Delta (58) and United (57). American (from December 17, 2015), Delta and United all operate nonstop services to the most transpacific destinations (four). Norwegian Air Shuttle (Operated by Norwegian Long Haul) serves the most destinations in Europe (three), while Alaska Airlines/Horizon serve the most destinations in Mexico (eight). This table lists passenger flights served with a nonstop or direct flight with no change of aircraft carrying passengers originating in Los Angeles according to the airlines' published schedules, unless otherwise noted., 93552=On March 19, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its debut at LAX, landing on runway 24L. Though LAX was originally to be the first U.S. city to see the A380, Airbus later decided to forgo LAX in favor of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. After city officials fought for the super-jumbo jet to land at LAX, Airbus had to get two A380s, where they A380 landed simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles.[58], 87436=This terminal opened for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games and is named for Tom Bradley, the first African-American and longest-serving (20 years) mayor of Los Angeles, and champion of LAX. The terminal is located at the west end of the passenger terminal area between TerminalsÃ‚Â 3 andÃ‚Â 4. Tom Bradley International Terminal hosts 29 airlines and handles 10 million passengers per year., 40624=The airport closed again on January 17, 1994 after the Northridge earthquake., 42091=In 2000, before Los Angeles hosted the Democratic National Convention, fifteen glass pylons up to ten stories high were placed in a circle around the intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and Century Boulevard, with more pylons of decreasing height following Century Boulevard eastward, evoking a sense of departure and arrival. Conceived by the designers at Selbert Perkins Design, the towers and 30-foot (9.1Ã‚Â m) ""LAX"" letters are a gateway to the airport and offer a welcoming landmark for visitors.[19] Illuminated from the inside, the pylons slowly cycle through a rainbow of colors that represents the multicultural makeup of Los Angeles and can be customized to celebrate events, holidays or a season. This was part of an overall face-lift that included new signage and various other cosmetic enhancements that was led by Ted Tokio Tanaka Architects. The LAX pylons underwent improvements in 2006, as stage lighting inside the cylinders was replaced with LED lights to conserve energy, make maintenance easier and enable on-demand cycling through various color effects.[20], 246500=The Coast Guard is planning to close Coast Guard Air Station Los Angeles and move its aircraft and personnel to Naval Air Station Point Mugu, part of Naval Base Ventura County in Oxnard, California, when the lease on the existing facility ends in 2016.[112][113], 210899=In terms of international passengers, as of 2012, LAX is the third busiest in the United States. (behind JFK in New York City and MIA in Miami)[99] and, as of 2006, 26th worldwide.[100], 209683=It is the world's fifth-busiest airport by passenger traffic[96] and fifteenth-busiest by cargo traffic,[97] serving over 70.6 million passengers and 2 million tons of freight and mail in 2014. It is the busiest airport in the state of California, and the second-busiest airport by passenger boardings in the United States, based on final 2013 statistics.[98], 64165=Former tenants of the terminal include Air China, Air New Zealand, Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, and TACA International Airlines. Air New Zealand moved to the Tom Bradley International Terminal on December 3, 2014[40] and Air China moved to the Tom Bradley International Terminal on July 1, 2015.[41], 95433=Qantas launched service with the Airbus A380 on October 20, 2008, using the west side remote gates. Though initially deployed between LAX and Sydney, Qantas' A380 service was extended to the LAX-Melbourne route. This was followed shortly by Korean Air, which initiated nonstop A380 flights to Seoul-Incheon in October 2011. Air France has launched A380 flights between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Los Angeles in May 2012. In addition, China Southern Airlines launched A380 service to Guangzhou in October 2012, representing an increase in capacity of 78% on the route. With the addition of these services, LAX boasted six daily A380 services. On October 15, British Airways' nonstop service from London Heathrow to LAX also became an A380 route.[60], 61004=Terminal 1 has 15 gates: Gates 1Ã¢Â€Â“3, 4AÃ¢Â€Â“4B, and 5Ã¢Â€Â“14 (re numbered to 9, 10, 11A-11B, 12A-12B, 13-15, 16A-16B, 17A-17B, and 18A-18B, as of mid-May 2015), and houses Southwest Airlines. Terminal 1 was built in 1984. Terminal 1 is presently undergoing an extensive renovation financed by Southwest Airlines. This renovation will continue through 2018 and provide updates to security screening area, curbside dropoff, terminal areas and baggage handling.[37], 48748=Before the 1930s, existing airports used a two-letter abbreviation based on the weather stations at the airports. At that time, ""LA"" served as the designation for Los Angeles Airport. But with the rapid growth in the aviation industry the designations expanded to three letters c. 1947, and ""LA"" became ""LAX."" The letter ""X"" has no specific meaning in this identifier.[28] ""LAX"" is also used for the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro and by Amtrak for Union Station in downtown Los Angeles., 40340=On April 29, 1992, the airport closed for violence and cleanup after the 1992 Los Angeles Riots over the Rodney King beating.}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 22:41:55 GMT"

As of 28 May 2008, only two countries still use the three-mile (5Ã‚Â km) limit: Jordan and Palau.[4] That limit is also used in certain Australian islands, an area of Belize, some Japanese straits, certain areas of Papua New Guinea, and a few British Overseas Territories, such as Anguilla. In the early 20th century, some nations expressed their desire to extend national claims: to include mineral resources, to protect fish stocks, and to provide the means to enforce pollution controls. (The League of Nations called a 1930 conference at The Hague, but no agreements resulted.) Using the customary international law principle of a nation's right to protect its natural resources, President Truman in 1945 extended United States control to all the natural resources of its continental shelf. Other nations were quick to follow suit. Between 1946 and 1950, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador extended their rights to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370Ã‚Â km) to cover their Humboldt Current fishing","In 1956, the United Nations held its first Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) at Geneva, Switzerland. UNCLOS I resulted in four treaties concluded in 1958: Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, entry into force: 10 September 1964 Convention on the Continental Shelf, entry into force: 10 June 1964 Convention on the High Seas, entry into force: 30 September 1962 Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas, entry into force: 20 March 1966 Although UNCLOS I was considered a success, it left open the important issue of breadth of territorial waters.[5] UNCLOS II[edit] In 1960, the United Nations held the second Conference on the Law of the Sea (""UNCLOS II""); however, the six-week Geneva conference did not result in any new agreements.[5] Generally speaking, developing nations and third world countries participated only as clients, allies, or dependents of the United States or the Soviet Union, with no significant voice of their own.[citation needed] UNCLOS III[",True,0,0,,"{3004=The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), also called the Law of the Sea Convention or the Law of the Sea treaty, is the international agreement that resulted from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982. The Law of the Sea Convention defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. The Convention, concluded in 1982, replaced four 1958 treaties. UNCLOS came into force in 1994, a year after Guyana became the 60th nation to sign the treaty.[1] As of January 2015, 166 countries and the European Union have joined in the Convention. However, it is uncertain as to what extent the Convention codifies customary international law., 12359=In 1956, the United Nations held its first Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) at Geneva, Switzerland. UNCLOS I resulted in four treaties concluded in 1958:, 16141=The issue of varying claims of territorial waters was raised in the UN in 1967 by Arvid Pardo, of Malta, and in 1973 the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was convened in New York. In an attempt to reduce the possibility of groups of nation-states dominating the negotiations, the conference used a consensus process rather than majority vote. With more than 160 nations participating, the conference lasted until 1982. The resulting convention came into force on 16 November 1994, one year after the sixtieth state, Guyana, ratified the treaty., 25395=From 1983 to 1990, the United States accepted all but Part XI as customary international law, while attempting to establish an alternative regime for exploitation of the minerals of the deep seabed. An agreement was made with other seabed mining nations and licenses were granted to four international consortia. Concurrently, the Preparatory Commission was established to prepare for the eventual coming into force of the Convention-recognized claims by applicants, sponsored by signatories of the Convention. Overlaps between the two groups were resolved, but a decline in the demand for minerals from the seabed made the seabed regime significantly less relevant. In addition, the decline of Socialism and the fall of Communism in the late 1980s had removed much of the support for some of the more contentious Part XI provisions., 8449=In the early 20th century, some nations expressed their desire to extend national claims: to include mineral resources, to protect fish stocks, and to provide the means to enforce pollution controls. (The League of Nations called a 1930 conference at The Hague, but no agreements resulted.) Using the customary international law principle of a nation's right to protect its natural resources, President Truman in 1945 extended United States control to all the natural resources of its continental shelf. Other nations were quick to follow suit. Between 1946 and 1950, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador extended their rights to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370Ã‚Â km) to cover their Humboldt Current fishing grounds. Other nations extended their territorial seas to 12 nautical miles (22Ã‚Â km)., 26241=In 1990, consultations were begun between signatories and non-signatories (including the United States) over the possibility of modifying the Convention to allow the industrialized countries to join the Convention. The resulting 1994 Agreement on Implementation was adopted as a binding international Convention. It mandated that key articles, including those on limitation of seabed production and mandatory technology transfer, would not be applied, that the United States, if it became a member, would be guaranteed a seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority, and finally, that voting would be done in groups, with each group able to block decisions on substantive matters. The 1994 Agreement also established a Finance Committee that would originate the financial decisions of the Authority, to which the largest donors would automatically be members and in which decisions would be made by consensus., 31643=The convention was opened for signature on 10 December 1982 and entered into force on 16 November 1994 upon deposition of the 60th instrument of ratification.[1] The convention has been ratified by 167 parties, which includes 166 states (163 member states of the United Nations plus the UN Observer state Palestine, as well as the Cook Islands, Niue) and the European Union.[2], 27176=On 1 February 2011, the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) issued an advisory opinion concerning the legal responsibilities and obligations of States Parties to the Convention with respect to the sponsorship of activities in the Area in accordance with Part XI of the Convention and the 1994 Agreement.[9] The advisory opinion was issued in response to a formal request made by the International Seabed Authority following two prior applications the Authority's Legal and Technical Commission had received from the Republics of Nauru and Tonga regarding proposed activities (a plan of work to explore for polymetallic nodules) to be undertaken in the Area by two State-sponsored contractors - Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (sponsored by the Republic of Nauru) and Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (sponsored by the Kingdom of Tonga). The advisory opinion set forth the international legal responsibilities and obligations of Sponsoring States AND the Authority to ensure that sponsored activities do not harm the marine environment, consistent with the applicable provisions of UNCLOS Part XI, Authority regulations, ITLOS case law, other international environmental treaties, and Principle 15 of the UN Rio Declaration.[10], 14222=In 1960, the United Nations held the second Conference on the Law of the Sea (""UNCLOS II""); however, the six-week Geneva conference did not result in any new agreements.[5] Generally speaking, developing nations and third world countries participated only as clients, allies, or dependents of the United States or the Soviet Union, with no significant voice of their own.[citation needed], 9814=By 1967, only 25 nations still used the old three-mile (5Ã‚Â km) limit, while 66 nations had set a 12-nautical-mile (22Ã‚Â km) territorial limit and eight had set a 200-nautical-mile (370Ã‚Â km) limit. As of 28 May 2008, only two countries still use the three-mile (5Ã‚Â km) limit: Jordan and Palau.[4] That limit is also used in certain Australian islands, an area of Belize, some Japanese straits, certain areas of Papua New Guinea, and a few British Overseas Territories, such as Anguilla.}","Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT"

Pero no nos queda otro remedioÃ‚Â»., 17456=De vuelta a 2012, tras el ataque de Zeca, el fratricidio de Robert y la narraciÃƒÂ³n de Marilia nos encontramos que Vicente, convertido completamente en una mujer que ha aceptado como suyo el nombre de Vera y estÃƒÂ¡ cooperando con Robert. Fulgencio, uno de los socios de Robert, lee una noticia sobre la desapariciÃƒÂ³n de un muchacho llamado Vicente y tras ver las fotos ata cabos y reconoce que ÃƒÂ©l es el paciente de la operaciÃƒÂ³n de cambio de sexo que Robert los engaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³ a ÃƒÂ©l y otros colegas para que le ayudaran a llevara cabo hace seis aÃƒÂ±os.}","Sun, 26 Jul 2015 20:32:17 GMT"

If yum updates are not working check your clock. Genesi Efika MX SmartTop generates a kernel warning on reboot and requires use of the reset button to actually reboot. Versatile Express images require the kernel parameter 'physmap.enabled=0' be passed to boot correctly. This is included in the boot-vexpress and boot-vexpress+x scripts. BeagleBoard-xM generates a kernel warning on reboot and requires use of the reset button to actually reboot. The tar.xz rootfs archives do not preserve SELinux information or file capabilities. If you use these to create your own filesystem image it is recommended that you switch SELinux to use warnings instead of enforcing for first boot, then relabel and reinstall packages that rely upon filesystem capabilities such as glibc-common and ping. Images are designed to be written to 2GB (console) or 4GB (xfce) SD cards. On first boot the partition will be resized to the maximum allowable amount. On the second boot the filesystem will be resized to fill the expanded partition. This works for SD cards, SATA Disks, and SSD drives.

Un dÃƒÂ©cret de l'AssemblÃƒÂ©e Constituante fait de Mont-de-Marsan le chef-lieu de ce dÃƒÂ©partement, au dÃƒÂ©triment de Dax, Saint-Sever et Tartas. GrÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  la dÃƒÂ©termination du dÃƒÂ©putÃƒÂ© Dufau, la ville fut donc dÃƒÂ©signÃƒÂ©e mais l'AssemblÃƒÂ©e prÃƒÂ©vit d'abord une alternance avec Dax, siÃƒÂ¨ge de l'ÃƒÂ©piscopat landais. En rÃƒÂ©alitÃƒÂ©, cette alternance n'a jamais eu lieu., 24917=Au dernier recensement de 2012, la commune comptait 31Ã‚Â 018Ã‚Â habitants, appelÃƒÂ©s Montois. Mont-de-Marsan est aussi ÃƒÂ  la tÃƒÂªte d'une agglomÃƒÂ©ration qui compte 18Ã‚Â communes rassemblant 56Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants. L'aire urbaine de la ville regroupe quant ÃƒÂ  elle 47Ã‚Â communes[2] pour un total de 68Ã‚Â 500Ã‚Â habitants comptabilisÃƒÂ©s en 2009[3]., 233232=Pour sa deuxiÃƒÂ¨me ÃƒÂ©dition, le festival prend de l'ampleur et dure deux jours. Les 5 et 6 aoÃƒÂ»t 1977, les arÃƒÂ¨nes accueillent notamment les groupes Little Bob Story, The Damned, Bijou, The Clash[44] (un 33 tours pirate a d'ailleurs ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© enregistrÃƒÂ© pour l'occasion), The Police, Rings, Maniacs, Lou's, Shakin'Street, Marie et les GarÃƒÂ§ons, Tyla Gang, Boys, Hot Rods, Dr. Feelgood et Asphalt Jungle (emmenÃƒÂ© par Patrick Eudeline). On pourra ÃƒÂ©galement noter le passage de Lou Reed, le lendemain du festival punk. Finalement, le festival de 1977 compta pas moins de 4Ã‚Â 000 spectateurs et il fit l'objet d'un film documentaire par Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois Roux nommÃƒÂ© Hot Cuts From Mont-de-Marsan[45],[46]., 84926=La fondation de Mont-de-Marsan est due ÃƒÂ  Pierre de Lobanner[20], vicomte du Marsan, du Tursan et du Gabardan. Jusque-lÃƒÂ , les vicomtes ÃƒÂ©taient basÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  Roquefort, plus ÃƒÂ  l'est, confluent entre deux cours d'eau, la Doulouze et l'Estampon. IntÃƒÂ©ressÃƒÂ© par le confluent de la Midouze, Pierre dÃƒÂ©cide entre 1136 et 1140 d'ÃƒÂ©tablir une nouvelle ville sur des terres issues des paroisses de Saint-Pierre-du-Mont et de Saint-GenÃƒÂ¨s-des-VallÃƒÂ©es[21]., 178932=En ce qui concerne le secteur privÃƒÂ©, l'ouverture rÃƒÂ©cente de l'autoroute Langon-Pau (A65) devrait permettre de stimuler de nouvelles activitÃƒÂ©s. La municipalitÃƒÂ© s'engage notamment dans le dÃƒÂ©veloppement des logiciels libres et souhaite voir ÃƒÂ©merger une zone d'activitÃƒÂ©s technopolitaine ÃƒÂ  l'est de la ville regroupant des entreprises innovantes autour d'une pÃƒÂ©piniÃƒÂ¨re, des ÃƒÂ©tablissements d'enseignement supÃƒÂ©rieur et des laboratoires de recherche. En parallÃƒÂ¨le, les diverses zones ÃƒÂ©conomiques de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration (Malage, Hapchot, Faisanderie...) se dÃƒÂ©veloppent au grÃƒÂ© des travaux et des acquisitions. La zone du Caloy, entre l'ÃƒÂ©changeur de l'A65 et la future gare LGV, constitue pour sa part un trÃƒÂ¨s fort enjeu pour les annÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ  venir. Entreprises de logistique et industries sont prÃƒÂ©vues d'ici 2016 ainsi que de nombreux bureaux., 118896=Avant-guerre, sous le mandat de Jean Larrieu, maire de la ville de 1932 ÃƒÂ  1944, sont rÃƒÂ©alisÃƒÂ©s les premiers pavillons du centre hospitalier LaynÃƒÂ©, des groupes scolaires ainsi que l'agrandissement des arÃƒÂ¨nes du PlumaÃƒÂ§on (ÃƒÂ©difiÃƒÂ©es en 1889)[19]., 119512=Durant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, la ville, occupÃƒÂ©e par l'armÃƒÂ©e allemande ÃƒÂ  partir du 28 juin 1940, est traversÃƒÂ©e par la ligne de dÃƒÂ©marcation. L'armÃƒÂ©e d'occupation rÃƒÂ©quisitionne la plateforme aÃƒÂ©rienne, et en fait la plus importante base de la Luftwaffe dans le Sud-Ouest de la France. Le 27 mars 1944, les installations militaires sont bombardÃƒÂ©es par une cinquantaine d'avions anglo-amÃƒÂ©ricains. Les dÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ¢ts collatÃƒÂ©raux entraÃƒÂ®nent la mort de 12 civils, on compte ÃƒÂ©galement quinze blessÃƒÂ©s[31]. La ville est finalement libÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e le 21 aoÃƒÂ»t 1944[19]., 117482=En 1866, l'annexion des communes de Saint-Jean-d'AoÃƒÂ»t-et-NonÃƒÂ¨res, Saint-MÃƒÂ©dard et d'une partie du territoire de Saint-Pierre-du-Mont augmente considÃƒÂ©rablement la superficie de la ville. La mÃƒÂªme annÃƒÂ©e est inaugurÃƒÂ© le lycÃƒÂ©e Victor-Duruy., 69083=En gascon le nom de la ville est Lo Mont[11][12][13] [lu.Ã‹Âˆmu(n)][14], voire Lo Mont de MarÃƒÂ§an [lu.mu(n).de.mar.sa(n)][14][15] quand il faut la distinguer d'autres villes aux noms similaires[1]. Par le passÃƒÂ© la forme Lou Mount, ÃƒÂ  prononciation identique mais dans une autre graphie, a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utilisÃƒÂ©, notamment par l'EscÃƒÂ²la Gaston FÃƒÂ¨bus, mais elle est aujourd'hui dÃƒÂ©suÃƒÂ¨te[16]., 213289=Dans le passÃƒÂ©, les pÃƒÂ¨lerins entraient dans la ville en franchissant l'ancien pont de la May de Diu, dont une pile est encore visible au niveau du parc Jean-Rameau. Ils avaient alors le choix entre se diriger vers la chapelle du prieurÃƒÂ© bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©dictin (dÃƒÂ©pendant de l'abbaye de Saint-Sever, sur l'emplacement actuel de l'ÃƒÂ©glise de la Madeleine) et trouver refuge dans les hÃƒÂ´pitaux du couvent des Clarisses ou des Cordeliers (aujourd'hui disparus). Ils remontaient ensuite l'actuelle rue Gambetta vers la place Jean-JaurÃƒÂ¨s (Sablar), quittaient la ville par la porte de Saint-Sever (dÃƒÂ©truite en 1777) et rejoignaient l'abbaye en passant par Saint-Pierre-du-Mont et Benquet., 126234=ArÃƒÂ¨nes du PlumaÃƒÂ§on (1889), labellisÃƒÂ©es Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Patrimoine du XXe siÃƒÂ¨cleÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» en 2007., 57345=Les hivers oscillent entre redoux atlantique et pÃƒÂ©riode froide avec phÃƒÂ©nomÃƒÂ¨ne de basse couche et fortes gelÃƒÂ©es pour environ quatre ÃƒÂ  six jours de neige par an. Le printemps est doux, bien que parfois pluvieux. En revanche, les ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©s sont particuliÃƒÂ¨rement chauds avec de gros orages les jours de fortes chaleurs. Quant ÃƒÂ  l'automne, c'est une saison plutÃƒÂ´t lumineuse avec des journÃƒÂ©es de fortes amplitudes thermiques. Des vents de 141Ã‚Â km/h ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© enregistrÃƒÂ©s le 24 janvier 2009 lors du passage de la tempÃƒÂªte Klaus, ÃƒÂ©tablissant un record depuis 1981[8]., 155191=En 2012, la commune comptait 31Ã‚Â 018Ã‚Â habitants. L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 105523=En 1517, le Marsan est rattachÃƒÂ© au domaine de la famille d'Albret, bordant la vicomtÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  l'ouest[19]. Cette famille rÃƒÂ¨gne alors sur la Navarre. Possession de Jeanne d'Albret (convertie au calvinisme en 1560), puis de son fils Henri III de Navarre, le futur roi Henri IV de France, la ville devient une place forte protestante. Elle se trouve totalement engagÃƒÂ©e dans les conflits armÃƒÂ©s opposant, ÃƒÂ  partir de 1560 en Gascogne, catholiques et rÃƒÂ©formÃƒÂ©s[19]. Blaise de Monluc s'en empare le 16 mai 1569, avant que les troupes huguenotes menÃƒÂ©es par Montgomery ne la reconquiÃƒÂ¨rent en 1577. De continuels assauts s'ensuivent, la ville passe ainsi de mains en mains. Un dÃƒÂ©cret tente de mettre fin ÃƒÂ  cette situation, mais sans rÃƒÂ©sultat. Les faubourgs de la ville sont dÃƒÂ©truits ainsi que le couvent des Clarisses[25],[26], situÃƒÂ© depuis le XIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle prÃƒÂ¨s de la porte de Roquefort[27],[28]. Henri III de Navarre, dans sa conquÃƒÂªte du pouvoir, entre en vainqueur en ville le 22 novembre 1583. Il adresse aux habitants une injonction qui ouvre la voie ÃƒÂ  une pÃƒÂ©riode de prospÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©conomique[24]. Jusqu'en 1586, il fait construire des bastions fortifiÃƒÂ©s, les Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â TenaillesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», protÃƒÂ©geant les accÃƒÂ¨s ÃƒÂ  l'est de la ville. Devenu le roi Henri IV de France, il rÃƒÂ©unit la ville ÃƒÂ  la couronne, en 1607[19]., 133774=AprÃƒÂ¨s une pÃƒÂ©riode de relatif endormissement, que ce soit sur le plan ÃƒÂ©conomique, dÃƒÂ©mographique ou urbanistique, on constate depuis la fin des annÃƒÂ©es 2000 une dynamique qui tend ÃƒÂ  changer le visage de la ville et ÃƒÂ  la rendre plus agrÃƒÂ©able et surtout, plus attractive. L'arrivÃƒÂ©e de l'autoroute A65 mettant Mont-de-Marsan ÃƒÂ  une heure de route des trois grandes villes que sont Bordeaux, Pau et Bayonne, et celle annoncÃƒÂ©e de la LGV donnent un nouveau souffle aux projets publics et privÃƒÂ©s qui se multiplient., 154697=En 1866, Mont-de-Marsan absorbe les communes de Saint-Jean-d'AoÃƒÂ»t-et-NonÃƒÂ¨res, Saint-MÃƒÂ©dard-de-Beausse et une partie du territoire de Saint-Pierre-du-Mont., 132518=Une politique d'urbanisation ÃƒÂ  l'horizontale, due ÃƒÂ  la volontÃƒÂ© du maire Charles Lamarque-Cando (1962 - 1983), fondateur des Castors Landais, modifie considÃƒÂ©rablement l'aspect de la commune ÃƒÂ  partir de 1962, faisant reculer sans cesse les limites de la forÃƒÂªt de pins au profit de nouveaux quartiers[19]. S'ÃƒÂ©tend sur la partie est de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration un vaste ensemble rÃƒÂ©sidentiel aisÃƒÂ© qui ne cesse de grignoter de nouvelles terres du fait de la rurbanisation., 229166=Le conseil gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral des Landes organise chaque annÃƒÂ©e depuis 1989 ÃƒÂ  Mont-de-Marsan un des plus grands festivals consacrÃƒÂ©s au flamenco en FranceÃ‚Â : Arte Flamenco. Lors de la premiÃƒÂ¨re semaine de juillet et pendant cinq jours, les thÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ¢tres, les cafÃƒÂ©s et les rues de la ville s'animent au rythme des spectacles de danse et de chant proposÃƒÂ©s par des artistes majeurs de la discipline. Des animations pour enfants, des projections et des expositions complÃƒÂ¨tent la programmation de ce festival devenu une rÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rence., 42785=La ville est concernÃƒÂ©e par les ZNIEFF de type 2 Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â VallÃƒÂ©e du Midou et forÃƒÂªt dÃƒÂ©partementale d'OgnoasÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[4] et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â VallÃƒÂ©es de la Douze et de ses affluentsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[5]. Elle est ÃƒÂ©galement concernÃƒÂ©e par les sites Natura 2000 Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â RÃƒÂ©seau hydrographique des affluents de la MidouzeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[6] et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â RÃƒÂ©seau hydrographique du Midou et du LudonÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[7]., 131911=En 1946, s'installe le Centre d'expÃƒÂ©riences aÃƒÂ©riennes militaires (base aÃƒÂ©rienne 118), donnant un nouvel essor ÃƒÂ  la citÃƒÂ© montoise[19]. La population augmente rapidement, ce qui permet l'ÃƒÂ©dification de premiers centres commerciaux., 133350=Le conseil gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral des Landes s'installe le 6 dÃƒÂ©cembre 1975 dans la Maison PlantÃƒÂ©, rue Victor-Hugo. Construite sous le Second Empire, elle fut d'abord la propriÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© d'Adolphe Marrast, conseiller gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral d'alors, qui la lÃƒÂ©gua ÃƒÂ  son neveu, le pianiste Francis PlantÃƒÂ©., 146151=Le plus grand projet d'amÃƒÂ©nagement entrepris par la ville est le programme phare baptisÃƒÂ© Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â RiviÃƒÂ¨res dans la villeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», qui marque le retour des trois cours d'eau (Douze, Midou et Midouze) au cÃ…Â“ur du nouvel amÃƒÂ©nagement du centre-ville. Les berges inondables doivent ainsi devenir des espaces de promenade verts pour piÃƒÂ©tons et vÃƒÂ©los. Le projet se propose ÃƒÂ©galement de mettre en valeur le patrimoine architectural et naturel jusque-lÃƒÂ  inexploitÃƒÂ© du cÃ…Â“ur de ville, notamment l'ancien port avec ses nombreuses cales et quais ainsi que les grandes places du centre-ville. C'est dans ce cadre que la place du thÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ¢tre et les rues piÃƒÂ©tonnes alentour ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© requalifiÃƒÂ©es en 2011, proposant notamment un pavage dit Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â en tresses brÃƒÂ©siliennesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» ÃƒÂ  partir de pierre calcaire de Catalogne[32]. En 2012, la cale de l'abreuvoir a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© entiÃƒÂ¨rement restaurÃƒÂ©e., 128158=Pont de Batz, point de passage entre zone occupÃƒÂ©e et zone libre, sous la voie ferrÃƒÂ©e marquant la ligne de dÃƒÂ©marcation de 1940 ÃƒÂ  1943., 180170=En outre, dans le cadre de la LGV Bordeaux-Espagne et grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  sa nouvelle gare, Mont-de-Marsan sera en 2027 (date prÃƒÂ©vue de la mise en service), ÃƒÂ  environ 30 minutes de Bordeaux, de Pau et de Bayonne, ÃƒÂ  1 heure de Toulouse et de Saint-SÃƒÂ©bastien (Espagne) et ÃƒÂ  2 h 30 de Paris., 115412=Mont-Marat, nom que prend la ville sous la RÃƒÂ©volution[30], n'est encore qu'une ville de campagne. Il faut rapidement y construire de nouveaux bÃƒÂ¢timents pour accueillir l'administration. Ainsi, au cours du XIXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, la citÃƒÂ© se transforme complÃƒÂ¨tement en se dÃƒÂ©pouillant de son aspect de ville forte. Les grands chantiers s'enchaÃƒÂ®nent dans le sillon de l'actuelle rue Victor-HugoÃ‚Â : construction simultanÃƒÂ©e du palais de justice et de la prison de Mont-de-Marsan, construction de la prÃƒÂ©fecture des Landes. AprÃƒÂ¨s que l'ancienne ÃƒÂ©glise du XIVe siÃƒÂ¨cle s'est effondrÃƒÂ©e, l'ÃƒÂ©glise de la Madeleine s'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ve en 1830, suivant un style nÃƒÂ©oclassique. Ailleurs, dans la ville, on refait les ponts et on commence la percÃƒÂ©e des boulevards[19]. Mont-de-Marsan bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ficie du dÃƒÂ©veloppement du rÃƒÂ©seau routier et de l'ouverture de voies ferrÃƒÂ©es., 178137=Aujourd'hui, la ville se redynamise petit ÃƒÂ  petit et profite de l'attractivitÃƒÂ© de la rÃƒÂ©gion pour gagner de nouveaux habitants. L'inauguration du centre pÃƒÂ©nitentiaire de Mont-de-Marsan a entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ© la crÃƒÂ©ation de 1Ã‚Â 000 emplois supplÃƒÂ©mentaires ÃƒÂ  partir de 2009 et la base aÃƒÂ©rienne 118 de Mont-de-Marsan a rÃƒÂ©cemment vu grossir ses effectifs avec l'arrivÃƒÂ©e de prÃƒÂ¨s de 380 nouveaux hommes grÃƒÂ¢ce au projet de rÃƒÂ©forme de l'armÃƒÂ©e voulu par le gouvernement Fillon., 118133=AprÃƒÂ¨s 1860 et l'implantation de la forÃƒÂªt des Landes voulue par l'empereur NapolÃƒÂ©on III, les activitÃƒÂ©s liÃƒÂ©es au bois s'ajoutent ÃƒÂ  celles du port. De riches nÃƒÂ©gociants s'installent et font bÃƒÂ¢tir plusieurs hÃƒÂ´tels particuliers sur la place du Commerce (l'actuelle place Pancaut). Mais dÃƒÂ¨s le dÃƒÂ©but du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, l'activitÃƒÂ© portuaire ralentit puis disparaÃƒÂ®t totalement en 1903., 122060=FaÃƒÂ§ade de l'ancienne prison de Mont-de-Marsan (1809, classÃƒÂ©e MH), 122933=PrÃƒÂ©fecture des Landes (1818, inscrite MH)., 165062=ÃƒÂ€ l'image de son territoire, Mont- de-Marsan gagne chaque annÃƒÂ©e un peu plus d'habitants, notamment grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  un solde migratoire et un accroissement naturel positifs. Pour 2020, les experts estiment que la population de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration atteindra 65Ã‚Â 000 habitants, contre 56Ã‚Â 000 ÃƒÂ  l'heure actuelle., 89501=Le port de Mont-de-Marsan s'ÃƒÂ©tablit plus loin, sur la rive gauche de la Midouze. Il connaÃƒÂ®t un dÃƒÂ©veloppement rapide grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  la position stratÃƒÂ©gique de la ville, ÃƒÂ  la limite de la Haute Lande, de la Chalosse et de l'Armagnac, entre Bayonne et Toulouse, Pau et Bordeaux. Ainsi, Mont-de-Marsan constitue une sorte de verrou entre toutes ces villes. Un nouveau quartier se dÃƒÂ©veloppe autour du nouveau port. S'y installe notamment le couvent des Cordeliers vers 1260[22]. Ce quartier est lui aussi entourÃƒÂ© de murailles percÃƒÂ©es de portes donnant accÃƒÂ¨s aux routes d'Aire-sur-l'Adour, Saint-Sever et Tartas. Le couvent de sainte Claire ou des Clarisses, installÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Beyries (sur la commune actuelle du FrÃƒÂªche) en 1256, est transfÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Mont-de-Marsan en 1275 non loin du ChÃƒÂ¢teau-Vieux., 235103=Il faudra que les organisateurs attendent l'arrivÃƒÂ©e du nouveau maire, Philippe Labeyrie, en 1983 pour faire renaÃƒÂ®tre le festival en 1984, 1985 et 1986. Il sera alors plus rock, le punk n'ÃƒÂ©tant plus tellement ÃƒÂ  la mode. Toutefois, aprÃƒÂ¨s cinq ÃƒÂ©ditions, le festival tire sa rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rence sans le soutien financier de la ville., 148687=La municipalitÃƒÂ© s'est ÃƒÂ©galement engagÃƒÂ©e dans le rÃƒÂ©amÃƒÂ©nagement et l'embellissement des entrÃƒÂ©es de ville avec notamment la volontÃƒÂ© de laisser un plus grand espace ÃƒÂ  la vÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©tation et aux modes de dÃƒÂ©placements Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â douxÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» (piÃƒÂ©ton et vÃƒÂ©lo). Actuellement, l'amÃƒÂ©nagement de l'entrÃƒÂ©e Ouest est achevÃƒÂ©e sur Mont-de-Marsan et offre dÃƒÂ©sormais des avenues entiÃƒÂ¨rement refaites ÃƒÂ  neuf agrÃƒÂ©mentÃƒÂ©es de pistes cyclables, de voies piÃƒÂ©tonnes, de nombreux arbres et de jardins linÃƒÂ©aires. ÃƒÂ€ mi-parcours, la place Saint-Louis est ÃƒÂ©galement transformÃƒÂ©e en plateau piÃƒÂ©ton et un belvÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨re offrant un point de vue sur la Midouze a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© amÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ©. Cet amÃƒÂ©nagement a reÃƒÂ§u plusieurs rÃƒÂ©compenses nationales comme le 2e prix du concours national des entrÃƒÂ©es de ville ou plus rÃƒÂ©cemment encore la Victoire d'Or aux Victoires du paysage 2012, catÃƒÂ©gorie Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Infrastructures vertesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». Prochaine entrÃƒÂ©e traitÃƒÂ©eÃ‚Â : l'entrÃƒÂ©e Nord-Ouest (avenue Henri Farbos, avenue de Sabres, avenue de Morcenx) entre 2015 et 2017., 109674=Les guerres de religion achevÃƒÂ©es, la parure militaire de la ville devient inutile. Richelieu, prÃƒÂ©textant des troubles, fait raser en 1622 une partie du ChÃƒÂ¢teau Vieux et le chÃƒÂ¢teau Nolibos[24]. Seuls subsistent aujourd'hui de ces fortifications quelques pans des anciennes murailles ainsi qu'une maison forte rue Maubec et une autre, appelÃƒÂ©e Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â donjon LacatayeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», ancien poste d'observation. La ville est ÃƒÂ  nouveau envahie pendant la Fronde, consÃƒÂ©quence de son ralliement aux princes fÃƒÂ©lons et de sa rÃƒÂ©bellion en 1653[24]., 124200=Ancienne bibliothÃƒÂ¨que municipale (1846), qui servit d'hÃƒÂ´tel de ville jusqu'en 1946., 111063=Au cours du XVIIe siÃƒÂ¨cle, plusieurs couvents s'installentÃ‚Â : les Clarisses, les Ursulines, les Barnabites, qui seront tous ÃƒÂ  leur tour rasÃƒÂ©s. La ville garde une place ÃƒÂ©minente comme marchÃƒÂ© aux vins, eaux-de-vie d'Armagnac et cÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©alesÃ‚Â : en 1654, Mont-de-Marsan est encore considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme le grenier de la Basse-Guyenne[19]. En 1777 est accordÃƒÂ©e l'autorisation de dÃƒÂ©molir les portes de la ville, et en 1809, on abattra dÃƒÂ©finitivement les restes du ChÃƒÂ¢teau Vieux. Tous ces travaux ont pour consÃƒÂ©quence d'aÃƒÂ©rer les accÃƒÂ¨s et de faciliter la traversÃƒÂ©e de la ville., 147408=Le programme CÃ…Â“ur de ville lancÃƒÂ© en 2009 entend redynamiser le centre en ravalant les faÃƒÂ§ades et en soutenant le commerce et l'habitat tandis que le quartier Nord (Peyrouat) fait actuellement l'objet d'une transformation, dans le cadre d'un ANRU et d'une ZAC, en ÃƒÂ©coquartier entiÃƒÂ¨rement rÃƒÂ©amÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ© (destruction des immeubles vÃƒÂ©tustes, crÃƒÂ©ation d'une voie verte et du concept de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Bois habitÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â Ã‚Â», mise en place du chauffage par gÃƒÂ©othermie[33], nouveau pÃƒÂ´le ÃƒÂ©ducatif...). Le programme court jusqu'en 2018 pour les derniÃƒÂ¨res touches sur les espaces verts et la circulation notamment., 196614=Dans son palmarÃƒÂ¨s 2014, le Conseil National des Villes et Villages Fleuris de France a attribuÃƒÂ© quatre fleurs ÃƒÂ  la commune au Concours des villes et villages fleuris[40]., 165562=Aussi, en 2009, 345 bÃƒÂ©bÃƒÂ©s sont nÃƒÂ©s sur le sol montois contre 280 personnes dÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©es. Par ailleurs, on compte plus de femmes (51Ã‚Â % de la population) que d'hommes et la tranche d'ÃƒÂ¢ge la plus forte est celle des 45-59 ans. Les retraitÃƒÂ©s reprÃƒÂ©sentent quant ÃƒÂ  eux 30Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages. La population montoise est ainsi plutÃƒÂ´t jeune comparÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  d'autres villes de taille comparable., 80741=Des fouilles archÃƒÂ©ologiques rÃƒÂ©alisÃƒÂ©es dans les annÃƒÂ©es 1980 puis dans les annÃƒÂ©es 2000 ont montrÃƒÂ© une occupation importante ÃƒÂ  l'ÃƒÂ¢ge du bronze. Les trÃƒÂ¨s nombreux vestiges de cÃƒÂ©ramiques richement dÃƒÂ©corÃƒÂ©es prouvent l'importance de ce secteur sans toutefois nous en donner son rÃƒÂ´le (habitats, fermes, lieux de cultes...)., 64524=Le rÃƒÂ©seau de bus urbain de la ville de Mont-de-Marsan se nomme Tma (prononcÃƒÂ© TÃƒÂ©ma) depuis le 9 juillet 2012. ExploitÃƒÂ© par la sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© Veolia Transport, il est composÃƒÂ© de 7 lignes (de la lettre A ÃƒÂ  G) parcourues par 18 bus (chacun reprÃƒÂ©sentant la couleur d'une des 18 communes de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration). En outre, une navette gratuite parcourt le centre-ville, effectuant une rotation toutes les quinze minutes. Le rÃƒÂ©seau propose ÃƒÂ©galement un service de transport ÃƒÂ  la demande ainsi que de location de vÃƒÂ©los (standard, pliants ou ÃƒÂ  assistance ÃƒÂ©lectrique)., 92337=AliÃƒÂ©nor d'Aquitaine apporte le duchÃƒÂ© d'Aquitaine en dot en 1152 ÃƒÂ  son mari Henri PlantagenÃƒÂªt, qui devient Henri II d'Angleterre en 1154. Mont-de-Marsan passe ainsi sous domination anglaise pendant prÃƒÂ¨s de trois siÃƒÂ¨cles, jusqu'en 1441. La population trouve refuge derriÃƒÂ¨re les murailles de la citÃƒÂ© durant les troubles liÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  la guerre de Cent Ans, pendant que sÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨vent des bastides[23] dans les environs. Durant cette pÃƒÂ©riode, la ville s'ÃƒÂ©rige en forteresse. Elle passe sous domination de la maison de Foix-BÃƒÂ©arn au XIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle. En 1344, Gaston PhÃ…Â“bus, vicomte de Marsan, fait restaurer le chÃƒÂ¢teau Nolibos et renforce les fortifications et dÃƒÂ©fenses de la ville[24]. La citÃƒÂ© connaÃƒÂ®t ensuite peu de transformations du XIVe au XVIIe siÃƒÂ¨cle[19]., 125112=Maison PlantÃƒÂ© (Second Empire), devenue l'hÃƒÂ´tel de DÃƒÂ©partement en 1975, 176898=La prÃƒÂ©sence de la base aÃƒÂ©rienne 118 a une influence primordiale sur le dÃƒÂ©veloppement ÃƒÂ©conomique et dÃƒÂ©mographique de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration, bien qu'elle empÃƒÂªche l'expansion gÃƒÂ©ographique au nord. Avec plus de 3Ã‚Â 800 hommes et femmes engagÃƒÂ©s, la base est un bassin d'emploi majeur qui, selon certaines ÃƒÂ©tudes, gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reraient plus de 200Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬ de retombÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ©conomiques par jour[37]. En outre, la BA 118 est considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme la premiÃƒÂ¨re entreprise du dÃƒÂ©partement. Les PME dans le secteur du bÃƒÂ¢timent sont pour leur part sources de valeur ajoutÃƒÂ©e. Cependant, durant les annÃƒÂ©es 1990 ÃƒÂ  2000, le tourisme[38] comme l'industrie sont restÃƒÂ©s quelque peu en retrait., 232123=Le 21 aoÃƒÂ»t 1976, de midi ÃƒÂ  trois heures du matin, sont ÃƒÂ  l'affiche Eddie and the Hot Rods (Angleterre), Ducks de Luxe, Brinsley Schwarz, Kursaat Flyers, Dr. Feelgood, Pink Fairies, Tyla Gang, Roogalator (Angleterre), The Gorillas (ÃƒÂ‰cosse), Railroad (Suisse), The Damned, Passion Force, Little Bob Story (Le Havre), Bijou, Il Biarritz et Kalfon Roc Chaud. Cette premiÃƒÂ¨re mouture du festival rassemblera prÃƒÂ¨s de 600 ÃƒÂ  700 personnes[43]., 150333=D'autres projets ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© lancÃƒÂ©s afin de dÃƒÂ©sengorger certaines parties de la ville. Ainsi, la crÃƒÂ©ation d'un boulevard Nord permettra d'ici 2016 d'allÃƒÂ©ger les problÃƒÂ¨mes de circulation sur le Nord de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration en proposant une liaison inÃƒÂ©dite d'est en ouest. La liaison Manot-Gare, dont le financement ÃƒÂ©tait assurÃƒÂ©, devait permettre quant ÃƒÂ  elle de dÃƒÂ©senclaver la gare de Mont-de-Marsan et de rÃƒÂ©duire de moitiÃƒÂ© le trafic automobile sur l'entrÃƒÂ©e Ouest de la ville. Or le chantier est au point mort ÃƒÂ  la suite d'ÃƒÂ©boulements imprÃƒÂ©vus qui ont fait exploser le budget., 82303=Les fouilles archÃƒÂ©ologiques des annÃƒÂ©es 1980 et 2000 ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utiles pour mieux comprendre comment se structurent les vestiges dans l'enceinte de Mont-de-Marsan. En effet, les niveaux archÃƒÂ©ologiques sont peu profonds et regroupÃƒÂ©s sur une faible ÃƒÂ©paisseur (40Ã‚Â cm environ). On peut aisÃƒÂ©ment comprendre que les constructions antÃƒÂ©rieures aux annÃƒÂ©es 1980 ont complÃƒÂ¨tement dÃƒÂ©truit les vestiges archÃƒÂ©ologiques et donc empÃƒÂªchÃƒÂ© de mieux connaÃƒÂ®tre l'occupation ancienne de la ville.}","Fri, 24 Jul 2015 13:31:19 GMT"

Un dÃƒÂ©cret de l'AssemblÃƒÂ©e Constituante fait de Mont-de-Marsan le chef-lieu de ce dÃƒÂ©partement, au dÃƒÂ©triment de Dax, Saint-Sever et Tartas. GrÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  la dÃƒÂ©termination du dÃƒÂ©putÃƒÂ© Dufau, la ville fut donc dÃƒÂ©signÃƒÂ©e mais l'AssemblÃƒÂ©e prÃƒÂ©vit d'abord une alternance avec Dax, siÃƒÂ¨ge de l'ÃƒÂ©piscopat landais.

L'ÃƒÂ©volution du nombre d'habitants est connue ÃƒÂ  travers les recensements de la population effectuÃƒÂ©s dans la commune depuis 1793. ÃƒÂ€ partir du XXIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, les recensements des communes de plus de 10Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â habitants ont lieu chaque annÃƒÂ©e ÃƒÂ  la suite d'une enquÃƒÂªte par sondage, contrairement aux autres communes qui ont un recensement rÃƒÂ©el tous les cinq ans[Note 1],[Note 2]., 105523=En 1517, le Marsan est rattachÃƒÂ© au domaine de la famille d'Albret, bordant la vicomtÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  l'ouest[19]. Cette famille rÃƒÂ¨gne alors sur la Navarre. Possession de Jeanne d'Albret (convertie au calvinisme en 1560), puis de son fils Henri III de Navarre, le futur roi Henri IV de France, la ville devient une place forte protestante. Elle se trouve totalement engagÃƒÂ©e dans les conflits armÃƒÂ©s opposant, ÃƒÂ  partir de 1560 en Gascogne, catholiques et rÃƒÂ©formÃƒÂ©s[19]. Blaise de Monluc s'en empare le 16 mai 1569, avant que les troupes huguenotes menÃƒÂ©es par Montgomery ne la reconquiÃƒÂ¨rent en 1577. De continuels assauts s'ensuivent, la ville passe ainsi de mains en mains. Un dÃƒÂ©cret tente de mettre fin ÃƒÂ  cette situation, mais sans rÃƒÂ©sultat. Les faubourgs de la ville sont dÃƒÂ©truits ainsi que le couvent des Clarisses[25],[26], situÃƒÂ© depuis le XIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle prÃƒÂ¨s de la porte de Roquefort[27],[28]. Henri III de Navarre, dans sa conquÃƒÂªte du pouvoir, entre en vainqueur en ville le 22 novembre 1583. Il adresse aux habitants une injonction qui ouvre la voie ÃƒÂ  une pÃƒÂ©riode de prospÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©conomique[24]. Jusqu'en 1586, il fait construire des bastions fortifiÃƒÂ©s, les Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â TenaillesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», protÃƒÂ©geant les accÃƒÂ¨s ÃƒÂ  l'est de la ville. Devenu le roi Henri IV de France, il rÃƒÂ©unit la ville ÃƒÂ  la couronne, en 1607[19]., 133774=AprÃƒÂ¨s une pÃƒÂ©riode de relatif endormissement, que ce soit sur le plan ÃƒÂ©conomique, dÃƒÂ©mographique ou urbanistique, on constate depuis la fin des annÃƒÂ©es 2000 une dynamique qui tend ÃƒÂ  changer le visage de la ville et ÃƒÂ  la rendre plus agrÃƒÂ©able et surtout, plus attractive. L'arrivÃƒÂ©e de l'autoroute A65 mettant Mont-de-Marsan ÃƒÂ  une heure de route des trois grandes villes que sont Bordeaux, Pau et Bayonne, et celle annoncÃƒÂ©e de la LGV donnent un nouveau souffle aux projets publics et privÃƒÂ©s qui se multiplient., 154697=En 1866, Mont-de-Marsan absorbe les communes de Saint-Jean-d'AoÃƒÂ»t-et-NonÃƒÂ¨res, Saint-MÃƒÂ©dard-de-Beausse et une partie du territoire de Saint-Pierre-du-Mont., 132518=Une politique d'urbanisation ÃƒÂ  l'horizontale, due ÃƒÂ  la volontÃƒÂ© du maire Charles Lamarque-Cando (1962 - 1983), fondateur des Castors Landais, modifie considÃƒÂ©rablement l'aspect de la commune ÃƒÂ  partir de 1962, faisant reculer sans cesse les limites de la forÃƒÂªt de pins au profit de nouveaux quartiers[19]. S'ÃƒÂ©tend sur la partie est de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration un vaste ensemble rÃƒÂ©sidentiel aisÃƒÂ© qui ne cesse de grignoter de nouvelles terres du fait de la rurbanisation., 229166=Le conseil gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral des Landes organise chaque annÃƒÂ©e depuis 1989 ÃƒÂ  Mont-de-Marsan un des plus grands festivals consacrÃƒÂ©s au flamenco en FranceÃ‚Â : Arte Flamenco. Lors de la premiÃƒÂ¨re semaine de juillet et pendant cinq jours, les thÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ¢tres, les cafÃƒÂ©s et les rues de la ville s'animent au rythme des spectacles de danse et de chant proposÃƒÂ©s par des artistes majeurs de la discipline. Des animations pour enfants, des projections et des expositions complÃƒÂ¨tent la programmation de ce festival devenu une rÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rence., 42785=La ville est concernÃƒÂ©e par les ZNIEFF de type 2 Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â VallÃƒÂ©e du Midou et forÃƒÂªt dÃƒÂ©partementale d'OgnoasÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[4] et Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â VallÃƒÂ©es de la Douze et de ses affluentsÃ‚Â Ã‚Â»[5].

La population augmente rapidement, ce qui permet l'ÃƒÂ©dification de premiers centres commerciaux., 133350=Le conseil gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral des Landes s'installe le 6 dÃƒÂ©cembre 1975 dans la Maison PlantÃƒÂ©, rue Victor-Hugo. Construite sous le Second Empire, elle fut d'abord la propriÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© d'Adolphe Marrast, conseiller gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral d'alors, qui la lÃƒÂ©gua ÃƒÂ  son neveu, le pianiste Francis PlantÃƒÂ©., 146151=Le plus grand projet d'amÃƒÂ©nagement entrepris par la ville est le programme phare baptisÃƒÂ© Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â RiviÃƒÂ¨res dans la villeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», qui marque le retour des trois cours d'eau (Douze, Midou et Midouze) au cÃ…Â“ur du nouvel amÃƒÂ©nagement du centre-ville. Les berges inondables doivent ainsi devenir des espaces de promenade verts pour piÃƒÂ©tons et vÃƒÂ©los. Le projet se propose ÃƒÂ©galement de mettre en valeur le patrimoine architectural et naturel jusque-lÃƒÂ  inexploitÃƒÂ© du cÃ…Â“ur de ville, notamment l'ancien port avec ses nombreuses cales et quais ainsi que les grandes places du centre-ville. C'est dans ce cadre que la place du thÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ¢tre et les rues piÃƒÂ©tonnes alentour ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© requalifiÃƒÂ©es en 2011, proposant notamment un pavage dit Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â en tresses brÃƒÂ©siliennesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» ÃƒÂ  partir de pierre calcaire de Catalogne[32]. En 2012, la cale de l'abreuvoir a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© entiÃƒÂ¨rement restaurÃƒÂ©e., 128158=Pont de Batz, point de passage entre zone occupÃƒÂ©e et zone libre, sous la voie ferrÃƒÂ©e marquant la ligne de dÃƒÂ©marcation de 1940 ÃƒÂ  1943., 180170=En outre, dans le cadre de la LGV Bordeaux-Espagne et grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  sa nouvelle gare, Mont-de-Marsan sera en 2027 (date prÃƒÂ©vue de la mise en service), ÃƒÂ  environ 30 minutes de Bordeaux, de Pau et de Bayonne, ÃƒÂ  1 heure de Toulouse et de Saint-SÃƒÂ©bastien (Espagne) et ÃƒÂ  2 h 30 de Paris., 115412=Mont-Marat, nom que prend la ville sous la RÃƒÂ©volution[30], n'est encore qu'une ville de campagne. Il faut rapidement y construire de nouveaux bÃƒÂ¢timents pour accueillir l'administration. Ainsi, au cours du XIXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, la citÃƒÂ© se transforme complÃƒÂ¨tement en se dÃƒÂ©pouillant de son aspect de ville forte. Les grands chantiers s'enchaÃƒÂ®nent dans le sillon de l'actuelle rue Victor-HugoÃ‚Â : construction simultanÃƒÂ©e du palais de justice et de la prison de Mont-de-Marsan, construction de la prÃƒÂ©fecture des Landes. AprÃƒÂ¨s que l'ancienne ÃƒÂ©glise du XIVe siÃƒÂ¨cle s'est effondrÃƒÂ©e, l'ÃƒÂ©glise de la Madeleine s'ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ve en 1830, suivant un style nÃƒÂ©oclassique. Ailleurs, dans la ville, on refait les ponts et on commence la percÃƒÂ©e des boulevards[19]. Mont-de-Marsan bÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ficie du dÃƒÂ©veloppement du rÃƒÂ©seau routier et de l'ouverture de voies ferrÃƒÂ©es., 178137=Aujourd'hui, la ville se redynamise petit ÃƒÂ  petit et profite de l'attractivitÃƒÂ© de la rÃƒÂ©gion pour gagner de nouveaux habitants. L'inauguration du centre pÃƒÂ©nitentiaire de Mont-de-Marsan a entraÃƒÂ®nÃƒÂ© la crÃƒÂ©ation de 1Ã‚Â 000 emplois supplÃƒÂ©mentaires ÃƒÂ  partir de 2009 et la base aÃƒÂ©rienne 118 de Mont-de-Marsan a rÃƒÂ©cemment vu grossir ses effectifs avec l'arrivÃƒÂ©e de prÃƒÂ¨s de 380 nouveaux hommes grÃƒÂ¢ce au projet de rÃƒÂ©forme de l'armÃƒÂ©e voulu par le gouvernement Fillon., 118133=AprÃƒÂ¨s 1860 et l'implantation de la forÃƒÂªt des Landes voulue par l'empereur NapolÃƒÂ©on III, les activitÃƒÂ©s liÃƒÂ©es au bois s'ajoutent ÃƒÂ  celles du port. De riches nÃƒÂ©gociants s'installent et font bÃƒÂ¢tir plusieurs hÃƒÂ´tels particuliers sur la place du Commerce (l'actuelle place Pancaut). Mais dÃƒÂ¨s le dÃƒÂ©but du XXeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle, l'activitÃƒÂ© portuaire ralentit puis disparaÃƒÂ®t totalement en 1903., 122060=FaÃƒÂ§ade de l'ancienne prison de Mont-de-Marsan (1809, classÃƒÂ©e MH), 122933=PrÃƒÂ©fecture des Landes (1818, inscrite MH)., 165062=ÃƒÂ€ l'image de son territoire, Mont- de-Marsan gagne chaque annÃƒÂ©e un peu plus d'habitants, notamment grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  un solde migratoire et un accroissement naturel positifs. Pour 2020, les experts estiment que la population de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration atteindra 65Ã‚Â 000 habitants, contre 56Ã‚Â 000 ÃƒÂ  l'heure actuelle., 89501=Le port de Mont-de-Marsan s'ÃƒÂ©tablit plus loin, sur la rive gauche de la Midouze. Il connaÃƒÂ®t un dÃƒÂ©veloppement rapide grÃƒÂ¢ce ÃƒÂ  la position stratÃƒÂ©gique de la ville, ÃƒÂ  la limite de la Haute Lande, de la Chalosse et de l'Armagnac, entre Bayonne et Toulouse, Pau et Bordeaux. Ainsi, Mont-de-Marsan constitue une sorte de verrou entre toutes ces villes. Un nouveau quartier se dÃƒÂ©veloppe autour du nouveau port. S'y installe notamment le couvent des Cordeliers vers 1260[22]. Ce quartier est lui aussi entourÃƒÂ© de murailles percÃƒÂ©es de portes donnant accÃƒÂ¨s aux routes d'Aire-sur-l'Adour, Saint-Sever et Tartas. Le couvent de sainte Claire ou des Clarisses, installÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Beyries (sur la commune actuelle du FrÃƒÂªche) en 1256, est transfÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  Mont-de-Marsan en 1275 non loin du ChÃƒÂ¢teau-Vieux., 235103=Il faudra que les organisateurs attendent l'arrivÃƒÂ©e du nouveau maire, Philippe Labeyrie, en 1983 pour faire renaÃƒÂ®tre le festival en 1984, 1985 et 1986. Il sera alors plus rock, le punk n'ÃƒÂ©tant plus tellement ÃƒÂ  la mode. Toutefois, aprÃƒÂ¨s cinq ÃƒÂ©ditions, le festival tire sa rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rence sans le soutien financier de la ville., 148687=La municipalitÃƒÂ© s'est ÃƒÂ©galement engagÃƒÂ©e dans le rÃƒÂ©amÃƒÂ©nagement et l'embellissement des entrÃƒÂ©es de ville avec notamment la volontÃƒÂ© de laisser un plus grand espace ÃƒÂ  la vÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©tation et aux modes de dÃƒÂ©placements Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â douxÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» (piÃƒÂ©ton et vÃƒÂ©lo). Actuellement, l'amÃƒÂ©nagement de l'entrÃƒÂ©e Ouest est achevÃƒÂ©e sur Mont-de-Marsan et offre dÃƒÂ©sormais des avenues entiÃƒÂ¨rement refaites ÃƒÂ  neuf agrÃƒÂ©mentÃƒÂ©es de pistes cyclables, de voies piÃƒÂ©tonnes, de nombreux arbres et de jardins linÃƒÂ©aires. ÃƒÂ€ mi-parcours, la place Saint-Louis est ÃƒÂ©galement transformÃƒÂ©e en plateau piÃƒÂ©ton et un belvÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨re offrant un point de vue sur la Midouze a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© amÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ©. Cet amÃƒÂ©nagement a reÃƒÂ§u plusieurs rÃƒÂ©compenses nationales comme le 2e prix du concours national des entrÃƒÂ©es de ville ou plus rÃƒÂ©cemment encore la Victoire d'Or aux Victoires du paysage 2012, catÃƒÂ©gorie Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Infrastructures vertesÃ‚Â Ã‚Â».

Richelieu, prÃƒÂ©textant des troubles, fait raser en 1622 une partie du ChÃƒÂ¢teau Vieux et le chÃƒÂ¢teau Nolibos[24]. Seuls subsistent aujourd'hui de ces fortifications quelques pans des anciennes murailles ainsi qu'une maison forte rue Maubec et une autre, appelÃƒÂ©e Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â donjon LacatayeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», ancien poste d'observation. La ville est ÃƒÂ  nouveau envahie pendant la Fronde, consÃƒÂ©quence de son ralliement aux princes fÃƒÂ©lons et de sa rÃƒÂ©bellion en 1653[24]., 124200=Ancienne bibliothÃƒÂ¨que municipale (1846), qui servit d'hÃƒÂ´tel de ville jusqu'en 1946., 111063=Au cours du XVIIe siÃƒÂ¨cle, plusieurs couvents s'installentÃ‚Â : les Clarisses, les Ursulines, les Barnabites, qui seront tous ÃƒÂ  leur tour rasÃƒÂ©s. La ville garde une place ÃƒÂ©minente comme marchÃƒÂ© aux vins, eaux-de-vie d'Armagnac et cÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©alesÃ‚Â : en 1654, Mont-de-Marsan est encore considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme le grenier de la Basse-Guyenne[19]. En 1777 est accordÃƒÂ©e l'autorisation de dÃƒÂ©molir les portes de la ville, et en 1809, on abattra dÃƒÂ©finitivement les restes du ChÃƒÂ¢teau Vieux. Tous ces travaux ont pour consÃƒÂ©quence d'aÃƒÂ©rer les accÃƒÂ¨s et de faciliter la traversÃƒÂ©e de la ville., 147408=Le programme CÃ…Â“ur de ville lancÃƒÂ© en 2009 entend redynamiser le centre en ravalant les faÃƒÂ§ades et en soutenant le commerce et l'habitat tandis que le quartier Nord (Peyrouat) fait actuellement l'objet d'une transformation, dans le cadre d'un ANRU et d'une ZAC, en ÃƒÂ©coquartier entiÃƒÂ¨rement rÃƒÂ©amÃƒÂ©nagÃƒÂ© (destruction des immeubles vÃƒÂ©tustes, crÃƒÂ©ation d'une voie verte et du concept de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Bois habitÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â Ã‚Â», mise en place du chauffage par gÃƒÂ©othermie[33], nouveau pÃƒÂ´le ÃƒÂ©ducatif...).

Par ailleurs, on compte plus de femmes (51Ã‚Â % de la population) que d'hommes et la tranche d'ÃƒÂ¢ge la plus forte est celle des 45-59 ans. Les retraitÃƒÂ©s reprÃƒÂ©sentent quant ÃƒÂ  eux 30Ã‚Â % des mÃƒÂ©nages.

Les trÃƒÂ¨s nombreux vestiges de cÃƒÂ©ramiques richement dÃƒÂ©corÃƒÂ©es prouvent l'importance de ce secteur sans toutefois nous en donner son rÃƒÂ´le (habitats, fermes, lieux de cultes...)., 64524=Le rÃƒÂ©seau de bus urbain de la ville de Mont-de-Marsan se nomme Tma (prononcÃƒÂ© TÃƒÂ©ma) depuis le 9 juillet 2012. ExploitÃƒÂ© par la sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© Veolia Transport, il est composÃƒÂ© de 7 lignes (de la lettre A ÃƒÂ  G) parcourues par 18 bus (chacun reprÃƒÂ©sentant la couleur d'une des 18 communes de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration). En outre, une navette gratuite parcourt le centre-ville, effectuant une rotation toutes les quinze minutes. Le rÃƒÂ©seau propose ÃƒÂ©galement un service de transport ÃƒÂ  la demande ainsi que de location de vÃƒÂ©los (standard, pliants ou ÃƒÂ  assistance ÃƒÂ©lectrique)., 92337=AliÃƒÂ©nor d'Aquitaine apporte le duchÃƒÂ© d'Aquitaine en dot en 1152 ÃƒÂ  son mari Henri PlantagenÃƒÂªt, qui devient Henri II d'Angleterre en 1154. Mont-de-Marsan passe ainsi sous domination anglaise pendant prÃƒÂ¨s de trois siÃƒÂ¨cles, jusqu'en 1441. La population trouve refuge derriÃƒÂ¨re les murailles de la citÃƒÂ© durant les troubles liÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  la guerre de Cent Ans, pendant que sÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨vent des bastides[23] dans les environs. Durant cette pÃƒÂ©riode, la ville s'ÃƒÂ©rige en forteresse. Elle passe sous domination de la maison de Foix-BÃƒÂ©arn au XIIIeÃ‚Â siÃƒÂ¨cle. En 1344, Gaston PhÃ…Â“bus, vicomte de Marsan, fait restaurer le chÃƒÂ¢teau Nolibos et renforce les fortifications et dÃƒÂ©fenses de la ville[24].

Avec plus de 3Ã‚Â 800 hommes et femmes engagÃƒÂ©s, la base est un bassin d'emploi majeur qui, selon certaines ÃƒÂ©tudes, gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reraient plus de 200Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â Ã¢Â‚Â¬ de retombÃƒÂ©es ÃƒÂ©conomiques par jour[37]. En outre, la BA 118 est considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme la premiÃƒÂ¨re entreprise du dÃƒÂ©partement. Les PME dans le secteur du bÃƒÂ¢timent sont pour leur part sources de valeur ajoutÃƒÂ©e. Cependant, durant les annÃƒÂ©es 1990 ÃƒÂ  2000, le tourisme[38] comme l'industrie sont restÃƒÂ©s quelque peu en retrait., 232123=Le 21 aoÃƒÂ»t 1976, de midi ÃƒÂ  trois heures du matin, sont ÃƒÂ  l'affiche Eddie and the Hot Rods (Angleterre), Ducks de Luxe, Brinsley Schwarz, Kursaat Flyers, Dr. Feelgood, Pink Fairies, Tyla Gang, Roogalator (Angleterre), The Gorillas (ÃƒÂ‰cosse), Railroad (Suisse), The Damned, Passion Force, Little Bob Story (Le Havre), Bijou, Il Biarritz et Kalfon Roc Chaud. Cette premiÃƒÂ¨re mouture du festival rassemblera prÃƒÂ¨s de 600 ÃƒÂ  700 personnes[43]., 150333=D'autres projets ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© lancÃƒÂ©s afin de dÃƒÂ©sengorger certaines parties de la ville. Ainsi, la crÃƒÂ©ation d'un boulevard Nord permettra d'ici 2016 d'allÃƒÂ©ger les problÃƒÂ¨mes de circulation sur le Nord de l'agglomÃƒÂ©ration en proposant une liaison inÃƒÂ©dite d'est en ouest. La liaison Manot-Gare, dont le financement ÃƒÂ©tait assurÃƒÂ©, devait permettre quant ÃƒÂ  elle de dÃƒÂ©senclaver la gare de Mont-de-Marsan et de rÃƒÂ©duire de moitiÃƒÂ© le trafic automobile sur l'entrÃƒÂ©e Ouest de la ville. Or le chantier est au point mort ÃƒÂ  la suite d'ÃƒÂ©boulements imprÃƒÂ©vus qui ont fait exploser le budget., 82303=Les fouilles archÃƒÂ©ologiques des annÃƒÂ©es 1980 et 2000 ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utiles pour mieux comprendre comment se structurent les vestiges dans l'enceinte de Mont-de-Marsan. En effet, les niveaux archÃƒÂ©ologiques sont peu profonds et regroupÃƒÂ©s sur une faible ÃƒÂ©paisseur (40Ã‚Â cm environ). On peut aisÃƒÂ©ment comprendre que les constructions antÃƒÂ©rieures aux annÃƒÂ©es 1980 ont complÃƒÂ¨tement dÃƒÂ©truit les vestiges archÃƒÂ©ologiques et donc empÃƒÂªchÃƒÂ© de mieux connaÃƒÂ®tre l'occupation ancienne de la ville.}","Fri, 24 Jul 2015 13:31:19 GMT"

With all of Landing bar Adrienne Snow joining up with Adam Forkner and Phil Jenkins from Yume Bitsu, the result is gripping, dramatic rock that will sound like manna from heaven for those who worship at the shrines of effects pedals. The opening track alone, ""The Open Sea,"" will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who loved early Slowdive; whichever one of the guitarists is performing the liquid, sky-soaring solo that defines the heart of the track has it on the money, it's that heart-wrenchingly beautiful. The steady build and blast of the band as a whole behind that is equally dramatic, and from there on Surface of Eceon can do no wrong. Another song that pushes the same buttons is ""Deep Grey Night""; when the singing comes in Ã¢Â€Â” soft but prominent against ever-stronger drumming and more swirling, soul-gripping guitars than seems possible Ã¢Â€Â” it's an awesome joy.

We also talk about subtle experiences of meditation, obstacles to enlightenment, yoga sutras, and balancing living in the world and the highest goal of life.', 'Wisdom to live by and share with others: There is only one highest reality and many teachers. All humans and life arise from the same one source. All countries, religions and institutions arise from that. There are many books of wisdom from many ages.

Cutthroat Standards & Black Pop is a fitting title for this alternately pretentious and sincere collection, which stylistically can only be called kitsch'n sink. Travis bounds from such show-tune numbers as ""So Far Away"" to a bit of Brecht/Weill-meets-Franziskaner madness on ""Have I Got a Deal for You"" to a loungy bossa nova groove on ""Sunday Is the Day for Love."" Like Elton John on his mid-'70s epics, Travis uses the CD canvas to prove her facility in multiple genres; a chanteuse for all seasons. Fortunately, she has the songwriting chops and malleable voice to do it; unfortunately, she goes to extremes in her steering, weighing down her songs with arrangements and deliveries excessively Elizabethan and thickly maudlin. The tiresome goth show-tune dramatics of ""October"" (""embrace the naked moon of Halloween"") show Travis' bad side Ã¢Â€Â” allowing her interest in cultivating an image to prevail over making sure the songs hold up as songs, first and foremost.

Etter at de republikkfiendlige partiene NSDAP, DNVP og KPD fikk over 50Ã‚Â % representantene i Riksdagen var det ikke lengre mulig ÃƒÂ¥ danne en parlamentarisk-demokratisk flertallskoalisjon. Intet annet sted var offentligheten blitt sÃƒÂ¥ ekstremt politisert og radikalisert som i Tyskland, og dermed var det ikke mulig ÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¥ til en stabil regjering uten et bredt flertall i ryggen. Intet annet sted var pÃƒÂ¥ samme tid bÃƒÂ¥de det gamle keiserrikets og de nye republikanske verdiene mer rystet enn i mellomkrigstidens Tyskland. Dette reduserte mulighetene for et kompromiss mellom liberale og konservative krefter. Tilbakevending til den autoritÃƒÂ¦re tiden (Ã‚Â«Politik der autoritÃƒÂ¤ren WendeÃ‚Â»): De gamle republikkfiendtlige elitene ÃƒÂ¸dela med vitende og vilje de vaklende parlamentarisk-demokratiske institusjonene i den hensikt ÃƒÂ¥ kunne reetablere en stat styrt av kongemakt og adel.

Dette partiet sto bak det sÃƒÂ¥kalte ÃƒÂ¸lkjellerkuppet i MÃƒÂ¼nchen den 8. november 1923. General Erich Ludendorff, en av de militÃƒÂ¦re toppene fra fÃƒÂ¸rste verdenskrig, var ogsÃƒÂ¥ med pÃƒÂ¥ kuppforsÃƒÂ¸ket., 35203=I lÃƒÂ¸pet av 1919 ble opprÃƒÂ¸rene i MÃƒÂ¼nchen og de ÃƒÂ¸stlige provinser slÃƒÂ¥tt ned, og forholdene i Tyskland ble til en viss grad normalisert., 55479=Enkle forklaringsmodeller som forsÃƒÂ¸ker ÃƒÂ¥ forklare Weimarrepublikkens fall ut fra ÃƒÂ©n enkelt ÃƒÂ¥rsak kommer til kort. Fallet skyldes verken utelukkende en institusjonell svikt i Weimarforfatningen eller den store depresjonens massearbeidslÃƒÂ¸shet som drev store velgerskarer i armene pÃƒÂ¥ nasjonalsosialistene. Den forsÃƒÂ¸mte demokratiseringen av rettsapparatet, forvaltningen og militÃƒÂ¦rvesenet kan heller ikke regnes som eneste ÃƒÂ¥rsak, ei heller de feilvurderinger som ble gjort av enkeltindivider innen republikken. Dessuten hadde Hitler og NSDAPs velgerappell kulminert ved ÃƒÂ¥rsskiftet 1932/33. Den fÃƒÂ¸rste tyske republikkens fall skyldes et helt knippe ÃƒÂ¥rsaker og de ulykksalige forbindelsene dem i mellom., 43643=Salget av papirmark for ÃƒÂ¥ kjÃƒÂ¸pe utenlandsk valuta som var pÃƒÂ¥krevd som betaling for den enorme krigsgjelden fÃƒÂ¸rte til at mellom 1921 og 1923 gikk papirmarken gjennom en kraftig devaluering. Verdien gikk videre ned pÃƒÂ¥ grunn av valutaspekulasjon. Den opprinnelige kursen mot amerikanske dollar var 4,2 mark pr. dollar. I august 1923 gikk det en million mark pÃƒÂ¥ en dollar, og den 20. november gikk det 4Ã‚Â 200Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000 mark pÃƒÂ¥ en dollar., 25456=Samtidige talsmenn og motstandere av republikk snakket alle om den tyske republikk (Deutschen Republik). I nasjonalforsamlingen av 1919 forsÃƒÂ¸kte begge sosialdemokratiske partiene Ã¢Â€Â“ SPD og USPD, ÃƒÂ¥ innfÃƒÂ¸re denne benevnelsen som statsnavn, ettersom benevnelsen riket hadde en sÃƒÂ¥pass dÃƒÂ¥rlig klang i utlandet. De liberale partiene, deriblant forfatningsjuristen Hugo Preuss i det liberale partiet Deutsche Demokratische Partei, ÃƒÂ¸nsket ÃƒÂ¥ bevare det tradisjonelle navnet det tyske riket, og fikk stÃƒÂ¸tte av representantene fra Deutsche Zentrumspartei og Deutschnationale Volkspartei. Senere kom deler av de borgerlige partiene likevel frem til at republikken ikke fortjente det gamle navnet. Ordlyden i Artikkel 1 i forfatningen Ã¢Â€Â“ Ã‚Â«det tyske rike er en republikkÃ‚Â», var derfor ogsÃƒÂ¥ et kompromiss., 51190=Valget i 1930 fÃƒÂ¸rte til at ingen lenger hadde noe flertall i riksdagen. BrÃƒÂ¼ning prÃƒÂ¸vde ÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¥ igjennom nÃƒÂ¸dvendige ÃƒÂ¸konomiske reformer, men tiltakene var upopulÃƒÂ¦re og mÃƒÂ¸tte stor motstand i riksdagen. Manglende stÃƒÂ¸tte i riksdagen gjorde at regjeringen ble helt handlingslammet, noe som fÃƒÂ¸rte landet mot stupet., 53223=Valget fant sted den 6. november 1932, og NSDAP gikk tilbake med 4 prosentpoeng. NSDAP var likevel stÃƒÂ¸rst med 33Ã‚Â % av stemmene. Papen gikk av og ble etterfulgt av Kurt von Schleicher den 3. desember. Schleicher greide heller ikke ÃƒÂ¥ samle et styringsdyktig flertall i riksdagen., 48545=I 1925 ble Paul von Hindenburg valgt til ny rikspresident. Han var sterkt hÃƒÂ¸yreorientert, men sterkt i mot Hitler og hans nasjonalsosialisme. Hindenburg ble sett pÃƒÂ¥ som den som kunne hindre at Hitler kom til makten., 33107=Den 23. november 1918 gjorde soldatene i Berlin opprÃƒÂ¸r. OpprÃƒÂ¸ret ble brutalt slÃƒÂ¥tt ned. Dette fÃƒÂ¸rte til en splittelse pÃƒÂ¥ venstresiden, og kommunistene lÃƒÂ¸srev seg fra det sosialdemokratiske SPD og dannet sitt eget parti, KPD., 46398=Hyperinflasjonen ruinerte mange som levde pÃƒÂ¥ oppsparte midler. Samtidig satte den ÃƒÂ¸konomien i Tyskland tilbake. FÃƒÂ¸rst i 1928 var reallÃƒÂ¸nnen i gjennomsnitt tilbake pÃƒÂ¥ 1913-nivÃƒÂ¥., 65744=Heinrich August Winkler peker pÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¸lgende vesentlige ÃƒÂ¥rsaker til fallet:[7][6], 30892=Den 28. oktober gjorde sjÃƒÂ¸menn i Wilhelmshaven og Kiel opprÃƒÂ¸r. Dette opprÃƒÂ¸ret var begynnelsen pÃƒÂ¥ novemberrevolusjonen og spredde seg raskt til hele riket. Den 7. november nÃƒÂ¥dde opprÃƒÂ¸ret Bayern, der kong Ludvig mÃƒÂ¥tte flykte. De kommunistiske opprÃƒÂ¸rerne utropte en bayersk sovjetrepublikk., 24261=Tyskland under Napoleonskrigene (1806-1814), 38857=Den 13. mars 1920 ble det gjennomfÃƒÂ¸rt et forsÃƒÂ¸k pÃƒÂ¥ statskupp. Frikorpset Marinebrigade Ehrhardt under ledelse av Reichswehrs ÃƒÂ¸verstkommanderende i Berlin, general Walther von LÃƒÂ¼ttwitz, besatte Berlin og installerte den hÃƒÂ¸yreorienterte Wolfgang Kapp som rikskansler. Den legitime regjeringen mÃƒÂ¥tte flykte til Dresden og senere videre til Stuttgart. Regjeringen satte i gang en generalstreik som lammet Tyskland, og Kapp mÃƒÂ¥tte gi opp allerede 17. mars., 52147=PÃƒÂ¥ grunn av manglende parlamentarisk flertall bestemte Papen seg for ÃƒÂ¥ opplÃƒÂ¸se riksdagen og skrive ut nyvalg. I valget i 1932 fikk NSDAP 37,2Ã‚Â % av stemmene og ble med det det klart stÃƒÂ¸rste partiet, i stor grad ved hjelp av manipulasjon og terrorisering av politiske motstandere. OgsÃƒÂ¥ de sovjetvennlige kommunistene, KPD, gjorde et godt valg og fikk 100 mandater i riksdagen., 18637=Epoken endte med Adolf Hitlers og nasjonalsosialistenes maktovertagelse i 1933. Selv om Weimarforfatningen av 1919 offisielt aldri ble forkastet, innebar det nasjonalsosialistiske styrets Gleichschaltung (Ã‚Â«koordineringÃ‚Â») i februar og mars 1933 at diktaturet i praksis kunne foreta politiske beslutninger i strid med grunnloven. Weimarforfatningen ble pÃƒÂ¥ denne mÃƒÂ¥ten tilsidesatt, og ÃƒÂ¥ret 1933 representerte derfor slutten pÃƒÂ¥ Weimarrepublikken og begynnelsen pÃƒÂ¥ nasjonalsosialistenes Tredje rike., 34427=Den 19. januar ble det avholdt valg i Tyskland. Ettersom bÃƒÂ¥de den ekstreme venstresiden og den ekstreme hÃƒÂ¸yresiden var dÃƒÂ¥rlig organisert, vant moderate krefter valget. PÃƒÂ¥ grunn av urolighetene i Berlin dro den nyvalgte nasjonalforsamlingen til Weimar, der en ny grunnlov, Weimarforfatningen, ble utformet. Denne grunnloven, som var utarbeidet av den jÃƒÂ¸diske juristen og politikeren Hugo Preuss, ble i samtiden sett pÃƒÂ¥ som svÃƒÂ¦rt liberal og progressiv., 45346=En ny regjering ble dannet for ÃƒÂ¥ lÃƒÂ¸se problemene. Ny rikskansler ble Gustav Stresemann (DVP). Stresemann fikk lÃƒÂ¸st streikeproblemene i Ruhr, og den 15. november 1923 ble det innfÃƒÂ¸rt en ny pengeenhet, Rentenmark. Det gikk 1Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000Ã‚Â 000 gamle mark pÃƒÂ¥ en ny. Den nye valutaen var forbudt ÃƒÂ¥ overfÃƒÂ¸re til utlendinger og dermed ble hyperinflasjonen stoppet slik at man inn i 1924 hadde en relativt stabil valuta i Tyskland. Da ble ogsÃƒÂ¥ overgangsvalutaen Rentenmark erstattet med den nye og varige Riksmark. Betalingen av krigserstatningen til ententen kunne gjenopptas., 29152=Forbundsrepublikken (1949Ã¢Â€Â“1990) ble ofte referert til som Bonnrepublikken og Ã‚Â«den andre republikkenÃ‚Â», i motsetning til Ã‚Â«den fÃƒÂ¸rste republikkenÃ‚Â» fra Weimar. Idag benyttes de tre benevnelsene Weimarrepublikken, Bonnrepublikken og Berlinrepublikken for ÃƒÂ¥ skille mellom de tre demokratiske periodene av Tysklands historie.[1], 49169=Samtidig ble Tyskland mer velsett internasjonalt. Stresemann, som nÃƒÂ¥ var blitt utenriksminister, fikk i 1925 inngÃƒÂ¥tt Locarnotraktaten som gjorde Tyskland til medlem av Folkeforbundet, med fast sete i sikkerhetsrÃƒÂ¥det som anerkjennelse for landets stormaktsstatus. For denne avtalen fikk Stresemann Nobels fredspris., 30469=Tysklands nederlag i fÃƒÂ¸rste verdenskrig i 1918 hadde sendt landet ut i kaos. Utstrakt matmangel, store sosiale forskjeller, impulser fra den russiske revolusjonen og de store tapene i krigen gjorde at det var en reell fare for revolusjon etter russisk mÃƒÂ¸nster ogsÃƒÂ¥ i Tyskland., 50750=Tyskland var nÃƒÂ¥ kommet i en ÃƒÂ¸konomisk krise pÃƒÂ¥ grunn av problemene i verdensÃƒÂ¸konomien. Depresjonen gjorde at mange var arbeidsledige, og oppslutningen om ytterpartiene ÃƒÂ¸kte. I riksdagsvalget i 1930 fikk Hitler 18,3Ã‚Â % av stemmene, og med 107 riksdagsmandater ble nasjonalsosialistene det nest stÃƒÂ¸rste partiet., 48990=De gode tidene gjorde ogsÃƒÂ¥ at nasjonalsosialistenes oppslutning stupte. I riksdagsvalget i 1928 fikk nazistene bare 2,6Ã‚Â % av stemmene og ble marginalisert., 52841=PÃƒÂ¥ bakgrunn av det sterke valget krevde Hitler politisk innflytelse og krevde at Hindenburg skulle utpeke ham til rikskansler. Dette nektet Hindenburg den 6. august. Siden det fortsatt ikke var noe klart flertall i riksdagen, ble det utskrevet nok et valg, med hÃƒÂ¥p om at noen endelig skulle fÃƒÂ¥ flertall., 53743=I januar 1933 mÃƒÂ¸ttes Papen, Hitler og Kurt von SchrÃƒÂ¶der for ÃƒÂ¥ finne en lÃƒÂ¸sning pÃƒÂ¥ den politiske krisen. De ble enige om at Hitler skulle bli rikskansler, med Papen som visekansler. Regjeringen skulle bare ha to nazistiske medlemmer i tillegg til Hitler og ville derfor ikke ha noe nasjonalsosialistisk flertall., 28334=Arthur Rosenbergs verk fra 1935 hadde tittelen Geschichte der deutschen Republik,[2] mens nyere utgaver og andre bÃƒÂ¸ker benyttet benevnelsen Weimarrepublikken i tittel eller undertittel. FÃƒÂ¸rst etter andre verdenskrig ble det politisk konsensus ÃƒÂ¥ bruke benevnelsen i journalistikk og historisk forskning. FÃƒÂ¸rste verk med tittelen Ã‚Â«Weimar-republikkenÃ‚Â» Ã¢Â€Â“ skrevet av Ferdinand Friedensburg, utkom i 1946.[3], 12291=Weimarrepublikken (1918/19Ã¢Â€Â“1933) er betegnelsen pÃƒÂ¥ Tysklands fÃƒÂ¸rste periode som demokratisk republikk. Den parlamentariske republikken ble opprettet i kjÃƒÂ¸lvannet av fÃƒÂ¸rste verdenskrig, novemberrevolusjonen og det tyske keiserrikes fall, og endte med utnevnelsen av Adolf Hitler som rikskansler og det pÃƒÂ¥fÃƒÂ¸lgende nasjonalsosialistiske diktaturet., 14594=Weimarrepublikken hadde i sin tid et av verdens mest liberale demokratiske styresett. I likhet med dagens Tyskland var Weimarrepublikken organisert som en forbundsstat hvor delvis autonome delstater hadde egne regjeringer og til dels egne lover. Fristaten Preussen var den stÃƒÂ¸rste staten i Weimarrepublikken med omkring 62Ã‚Â % av bÃƒÂ¥de territorium og befolkning. Fristaten Bayern var den nest stÃƒÂ¸rste delstaten, etterfulgt av Fristaten Sachsen, Den frie folkestaten WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg, Republikken Baden og Land ThÃƒÂ¼ringen. Alt i alt bestod Weimarrepublikken av 19 ulike territorier. I 1925 hadde den et areal pÃƒÂ¥ 468 787 kmÃ‚Â² og en befolkning pÃƒÂ¥ 62 411 000 innbyggere., 26982=Interessant nok valgte de ikke benevnelsen Fristat. Fristat er det tyske navnet pÃƒÂ¥ republikk, og ble valgt av tyske sprÃƒÂ¥kpurister pÃƒÂ¥ 1700- og 1800-tallet, som ÃƒÂ¸nsket ÃƒÂ¥ rense det tyske sprÃƒÂ¥ket for fremmedord. I 1918 ble bruken av benevnelsen Fristat aktualisert, ikke bare av rene sprÃƒÂ¥kpuristiske grunner, men ogsÃƒÂ¥ fordi det avledede franske ordet rÃƒÂ©publique ble assosiert med Frankrike, som hadde vÃƒÂ¦rt Tysklands fiende under fÃƒÂ¸rste verdenskrig. De fleste tyske delrepublikkene tok i bruk benevnelsen Fristat. Unntakene var Baden (republikk), Hessen (folkestat), WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg (fri folkestat), ThÃƒÂ¼ringen (land) og byene Bremen, Hamburg og LÃƒÂ¼beck (frie Hansabyer)., 33694=Flere forsÃƒÂ¸k fra kommunistene pÃƒÂ¥ ÃƒÂ¥ skape en arbeiderstat ble slÃƒÂ¥tt ned av de sterkt hÃƒÂ¸yreorienterte Frikorpsene. Luxemburg og Liebknecht ble drept av et frikorps den 15. januar 1919 etter det sÃƒÂ¥kalte spartakistopprÃƒÂ¸ret. Etter press fra den nye kansleren, den sosialdemokratiske anti-kommunisten Friedrich Ebert, gikk frikorpsmennene fri. Dette gjorde Ebert mektig upopulÃƒÂ¦r i kommunistiske kretser., 54285=Hindenburg var motstander av nasjonalsosialistene og var til ÃƒÂ¥ begynne med skeptisk til denne lÃƒÂ¸sningen, men Papen greide ÃƒÂ¥ overbevise Hindenburg om at det ÃƒÂ¥ ta Hitler med i regjeringen var en fin mÃƒÂ¥te ÃƒÂ¥ passivisere ham pÃƒÂ¥. Det ville gjÃƒÂ¸re Hitler lett ÃƒÂ¥ kontrollere, argumenterte Papen. Hindenburg gikk etterhvert med pÃƒÂ¥ dette, og 30. januar 1933 ble Adolf Hitler utnevnt til Tysklands rikskansler., 56768=Etter at Hitler var utnevnt klarte ikke de demokratiske partiene ÃƒÂ¥ enes om en felles strategi; selv det politiske sentrum vurderte mulighetene for en politisk koalisjon med NSDAP. Republikkens siste rikskansler, Kurt von Schleicher, forsÃƒÂ¸mte pÃƒÂ¥ sin side ÃƒÂ¥ gi presidenten alternativer til en grunnlovsstridig utsettelse av nyvalg. Dermed ville det for eksempel bli mulig for ham ÃƒÂ¥ sitte som leder for et forretningsministerium selv om han fikk et mistillitsvotum mot seg. Dersom de som framsatte mistillitsvotumet ÃƒÂ¸nsket ÃƒÂ¥ danne et regjeringsdyktig flertall, ville de kunne avvises med henvisning til at nÃƒÂ¥r det gjaldt regjeringsskifte var Riksdagen bundet av et Ã‚Â«konstruktivt mistillitsvotumÃ‚Â», selv om Weimarforfatningen ikke hadde forutsett dette. Konseptet med et Ã‚Â«konstruktivt mistillitsvotumÃ‚Â» forelÃƒÂ¥ allerede fra 1927, og Schleichers rÃƒÂ¥dgivere foreslo at et tilsvarende argument ble brukt mot Hindenburg., 91321='Der Untergang der Weimarer Republik: ZerstÃƒÂ¶rung der Demokratie 1930 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1932, 18198=Weimarrepublikken klarte likevel ÃƒÂ¥ hÃƒÂ¥ndtere mange av de alliertes krav: i 1924 ble pengepolitikken reformert med den nye myntenheten Reichsmark, en felles skattepolitikk for hele Tyskland ble innfÃƒÂ¸rt, og i 1920 ble jernbanesystemet samordnet med opprettelsen av Deutsche Reichsbahn., 13406=Tyskland hadde alminnelig stemmerett for menn fra 1871, men parlamentarismen, dvs. at regjeringen mÃƒÂ¥ ha stÃƒÂ¸tte i parlamentet, fikk fÃƒÂ¸rst sitt gjennombrudd helt pÃƒÂ¥ slutten av keiserrikets tid. 9. november 1918 ble republikken proklamert, og den nye grunnloven trÃƒÂ¥dte i kraft 11. august 1919. Statsdannelsens offisielle navn var Deutsches Reich (Ã‚Â«det tyske riketÃ‚Â»), en betegnelse som brukes om den tyske nasjonalstaten i ÃƒÂ¥rene mellom 1871 og 1945. For lett ÃƒÂ¥ skille de tre demokratiske periodene av Tysklands historie bruker dagens historikere betegnelsene Weimarrepublikken (1918/19Ã¢Â€Â“1933), Bonnrepublikken (1949Ã¢Â€Â“1990) og Berlinrepublikken (1990Ã¢Â€Â“).[1], 27872=Tilknytningen til byen Weimar ble opprinnelig bare brukt i sammenheng med forfatningen. FÃƒÂ¸rst under republikkens 10-ÃƒÂ¥rs jubileum i 1929 snakket de konservative, nasjonalsosialistene og kommunistene om Weimarrepublikken. I 1932 ble denne benevnelsen benyttet av den republikkvennlige avisen Vossische Zeitung i Berlin, 51581=I april 1932 var det valg pÃƒÂ¥ rikspresident. Hitler bestemte seg for ÃƒÂ¥ stille, men ble slÃƒÂ¥tt av en halvveis dement Hindenburg., 39868=Inspirert av generalstreiken dannet kommunistene en rÃƒÂ¸d armÃƒÂ© i Ruhr, bestÃƒÂ¥ende av 50Ã‚Â 000 frivillige. Dette opprÃƒÂ¸ret ble raskt slÃƒÂ¥tt ned av hÃƒÂ¦ren, med hjelp av frikorpsene. Det kom imidlertid flere kommunistoppstander, bl.a. i mars 1921 i Hamburg og i Sachsen., 36341=Den 10. januar 1920 ble Versailles-traktaten ratifisert. Denne traktaten dikterte fredsbetingelsene for Tyskland etter fÃƒÂ¸rste verdenskrig. Derfor er den ogsÃƒÂ¥ kjent som diktat-freden i Tyskland., 31665=Rikskansler Max von Baden forsto at det gikk mot slutten for keiserriket. Den 9. november 1918 bad han keiser Wilhelm II om ÃƒÂ¥ abdisere. Wilhelm abdiserte og flyktet til det nÃƒÂ¸ytrale Nederland., 44673=I januar 1923 klarte ikke myndighetene i Tyskland lenger ÃƒÂ¥ betale pÃƒÂ¥ krigserstatningene. Franske og belgiske tropper okkuperte da RuhromrÃƒÂ¥det, som var Tysklands mest industrialiserte landsdel. Franskmennene og belgierne tok kontroll over tyske gruver og bedrifter for ÃƒÂ¥ sikre fortsatte erstatningsbetalinger.

Other Technical and Conforming Changes Finally, we request comment on the time necessary for covered entities to review access requests and make necessary determinations, such as whether the granting of access would endanger the individual or other persons so as to better understand how the time needed for these reviews relates to the overall time needed to provide the individual with access. Further, we request comment generally on whether the provision which allows a covered entity an additional 30 days to provide access to the individual if the protected health information is maintained off-site should be eliminated altogether for both paper and electronic records, or at least for protected health information maintained or archived electronically because the physical location of electronic data storage is not relevant to its accessibility. We are also interested in public comment on whether, contrary to our assumption, a variety of timeliness standards based on the type of electronic designated record set is the preferred approach and if so, how we should operationalize such an approach. For example, how should we identify and characterize the various electronic designated record sets to which the different standards would apply, such as personal health","In addition to the technical changes listed in the table above, we propose to make a few changes that are technical or conforming in nature, but for which the reason for the change is more programmatic in nature. These are as follows: Section 164.506(c)(5) permits a covered entity to disclose protected health information Ã¢Â€Âœto another covered entity that participates in the organized health care arrangement.Ã¢Â€? We propose to change the words Ã¢Â€Âœanother covered entity that participatesÃ¢Â€? to Ã¢Â€Âœother participantsÃ¢Â€? because not all participants in an organized health care arrangement may be covered entities; for example, some physicians with staff privileges at a hospital may not be covered entities. Section 164.510(a)(1)(ii) permits the disclosure of directory information to members of the clergy and other persons who ask for the individual by name. We propose to add the words Ã¢Â€Âœuse orÃ¢Â€? to this permission, to cover the provision of such information to clergy who are part of a facility's workforce. Section 164.510(b)(3) covers uses and disclosures of protected health information when the individual is not present to agree or object to the use or disclosure, and, as pertinent here, permits disclosure to persons only of Ã¢Â€Âœthe protected health information that is directly relevant to the person's involvement with the individual's health care.Ã¢Â€?

Section 13408 also provides that a vendor that contracts with a covered entity to allow the covered entity to offer a personal health record to patients as part of the covered entity's electronic health record shall be treated as a business associate. Section 13408 requires that such organizations and vendors enter into a written business associate contract or other arrangement with the covered entity in accordance with the HIPAA Rules., 103781=Section 13421 states that HIPAA's State preemption provisions at 42 U.S.C. 1320d-7 shall apply to the provisions of subtitle D of the HITECH Act in the same manner as they do to HIPAA's provisions.

L. 104-191), which added a new part C to title XI of the Social Security Act (sections 1171-1179 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which was enacted as title XIII of division A and title IV of division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, modifies certain provisions of the Social Security Act pertaining to the Administrative Simplification Rules (HIPAA Rules) and requires certain modifications to the HIPAA Rules themselves., 143706=The term Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? is currently defined in Ã‚Â§ 160.202 to make clear when the preemption provisions of HIPAA apply to State law. Consistent with the limited application of the HIPAA provisions to covered entities only, the current definition of the term Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? does not include reference to business associates. However, section 13421(a) of the HITECH Act provides that the HIPAA preemption provision (section 1178 of the Social Security Act) applies to the provisions and requirements under the HITECH Act Ã¢Â€Âœin the same mannerÃ¢Â€? as it would apply under the HIPAA provisions. Thus, the preemption provisions would apply to business associates, who are now, by virtue of the HITECH Act, required to comply with certain provisions of the HIPAA Rules and are subject to penalties for noncompliance, as discussed elsewhere. Thus, we propose to amend the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? by inserting references to business associates in paragraph (1) of the definition. We also expand the reference to the HITECH statutory provisions in paragraph (2) of the definition to encompass all of the sections of subtitle D of the HITECH Act, rather than merely to section 13402, which was added by the breach notifications regulations. These changes would give effect to section 13421(a)., 197987=HHS proposes to amend Ã‚Â§ 160.410 to implement the revision of section 1176(b)(1) of the Social Security Act by providing in a new paragraph (a)(1) that the affirmative defense of criminally Ã¢Â€ÂœpunishableÃ¢Â€? is applicable to penalties imposed prior to February 18, 2011. A new paragraph (a)(2) in that section would make clear that, on or after February 18, 2011, the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that a penalty has been imposed under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6 with respect to such act. As a conforming change, current paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) are renumbered as paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, and current paragraph (b) is renumbered as paragraph (c)., 92925=The rules proposed below concern the privacy and security standards issued pursuant to HIPAA, as well as the enforcement rules that implement HIPAA's civil money penalty authority. The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœPrivacy Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued on December 28, 2000, and amended on August 14, 2002. See 65 FR 82462, as amended at 67 FR 53182. The Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœSecurity Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued on February 20, 2003. See 68 FR 8334. The Compliance and Investigations, Imposition of Civil Money Penalties, and Procedures for Hearings regulations, collectively known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœEnforcement Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued as an interim final rule on April 17, 2003 (68 FR 18895), and revised and issued as a final rule, following rulemaking, on February 16, 2006 (71 FR 8390)., 221035=We propose to amend paragraph (1) of the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœhealth care operationsÃ¢Â€? to include a reference to patient safety activities, as defined in the PSQIA implementing regulation at 42 CFR 3.20. Many health care providers participating in the voluntary patient safety program authorized by PSQIA are HIPAA covered entities; PSQIA acknowledges that such providers must also comply with the Privacy Rule and deems patient safety activities to be health care operations under the Privacy Rule. While such activities are already encompassed within paragraph (1) of the definition, which addresses various quality activities, we propose to expressly include patient safety activities within paragraph (1) of the definition of health care operations to expressly conform the definition to PSQIA and to eliminate the potential for any confusion. This modification would also address public comments the Department received during the rulemaking period for the PSQIA implementing regulations, which urged the Department to modify the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœhealth care operationsÃ¢Â€? in the Privacy Rule to expressly reference patient safety activities so that the intersection of the Privacy and PSQIA Rules would be clear. See 73 FR 70732, 70780, November 21, 2008., 383459=In Ã‚Â§ 164.512(k)(1)(ii), we propose to replace the word Ã¢Â€ÂœTransportationÃ¢Â€? with Ã¢Â€ÂœHomeland Security.Ã¢Â€? The language regarding a component of the Department of Transportation was included to refer to the Coast Guard; however, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. In addition, at Ã‚Â§ 164.512(k)(5)(i)(E), we propose to replace the word Ã¢Â€ÂœandÃ¢Â€? after the semi-colon with the word Ã¢Â€Âœor.Ã¢Â€? The intent of Ã‚Â§ 164.512(k)(5)(i) is not that the existence of all of the conditions is necessary to permit the disclosure, but rather that the existence of any would permit the disclosure., 71516=The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Ã¢Â€Âœthe DepartmentÃ¢Â€?) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule), the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (Security Rule), and the rules pertaining to Compliance and Investigations, Imposition of Civil Money Penalties, and Procedures for Hearings (Enforcement Rule) issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The purpose of these modifications is to implement recent statutory amendments under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (Ã¢Â€Âœthe HITECH ActÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€Âœthe ActÃ¢Â€?), to strengthen the privacy and security protection of health information, and to improve the workability and effectiveness of these HIPAA Rules., 108469=As noted above, certain of the HITECH Act's privacy and security provisions have already been the subject of rulemakings and related actions. In particular, the Department published interim final regulations to implement the breach notification provisions at section 13402 of the Act for HIPAA covered entities and business associates in the Federal Register on August 24, 2009 (74 FR 42740), effective September 23, 2009. Similarly, the FTC published final regulations implementing the breach notification provisions at section 13407 for personal health record vendors and their third party service providers on August 25, 2009 (74 FR 42962), effective September 24, 2009. For purposes of determining to what information the HHS and FTC breach notification regulations apply, the Department also issued, first on April 17, 2009 (published in the Federal Register on April 27, 2009, 74 FR 19006), and then later with its interim final rule, the guidance required by the HITECH Act under 13402(h) specifying the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. In addition, to conform the provisions of the Enforcement Rule to the new tiered and increased civil money penalty structure made effective by the HITECH Act on the day after enactment, or February 18, 2009, the Department published an interim final rule on October 30, 2009 (74 FR 56123), effective November 30, 2009., 172865=Prior rulemaking preambles discussing the Enforcement Rule explain the concept of knowledge, as it applies to the limitations (i.e., affirmative defenses) that section 1176(b) of the Social Security Act places on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty. As they explain, Ã¢Â€Âœthe knowledge involved must be knowledge that [a] violation has occurred, not just knowledge of the facts constituting the violation.Ã¢Â€?See 71 FR 8390, 8410, Feb. 16, 2006. Moreover, a covered entity or business associate cannot assert an affirmative defense associated with its Ã¢Â€Âœlack of knowledgeÃ¢Â€? if such lack of knowledge has resulted from its failure to inform itself about compliance obligations or to investigate received complaints or other information indicating likely noncompliance. See 70 FR 20224, 20237-8, Apr. 18, 2005 and 71 FR 8390, 8410-11, Feb. 16, 2006., 438974=We have integrated this PRA notice into the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, because these costs represent costs to be incurred as one-time, first year implementation costs. The estimated annualized burden table below was developed using the same estimates and workload assumptions in the impact statement in the section regarding Executive Order 12866, above. Because the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules have been in effect for several years, these numbers, as revised pursuant to the HITECH modifications, are based on past experience with the current information collection., 111933=We note that the final rule will not take effect until after most of the provisions of the HITECH Act became effective on February 18, 2010. We recognize that it will be difficult for covered entities and business associates to comply with the statutory provisions until after we have finalized our changes to the HIPAA Rules. In addition, we recognize that covered entities and business associates will need some time beyond the effective date of the final rule to come into compliance with the final rule's provisions. In light of these considerations, we intend to provide covered entities and business associates with 180 days beyond the effective date of the final rule to come into compliance with most of the rule's provisions. We believe that providing a 180-day compliance period best comports with section 1175(b)(2) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-4, and our implementing provision at 45 CFR 160.104(c)(1), which require the Secretary to provide at least a 180-day period for covered entities to comply with modifications to standards and implementation specifications in the HIPAA Rules. While the Social Security Act and the HIPAA Rules permit the Secretary to further delay the compliance date for small health plans, we do not believe that it is necessary to do so for this rule both because most of the changes being proposed are discrete modifications to existing requirements of the HIPAA Rules, as well as because the Department is proposing an additional one-year transition period to modify certain business associate agreements, which should provide sufficient relief to all covered entities, including small health plans. The Department welcomes comment on the assumption that it is not necessary to extend the compliance date for small health plans., 225080=Section 13406(a) of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, addresses these marketing provisions. In particular, section 13406(a) of the HITECH Act limits the health-related communications that may be considered health care operations and thus, that are excepted from the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœmarketingÃ¢Â€? under the Privacy Rule to the extent a covered entity receives or has received direct or indirect payment in exchange for making the communication. In cases where the covered entity would receive such payment, the HITECH Act at section 13406(a)(2)(B) requires that the covered entity obtain the individual's valid authorization prior to making the communication, or, if applicable, prior to its business associate making the communication on its behalf in accordance with its written contract. Section 13406(a)(2)(A) of the HITECH Act includes an exception to the payment limitation for communications that describe only a drug or biologic that is currently being prescribed to the individual as long as any payment received by the covered entity in exchange for making the communication is reasonable in amount. Section 13406(a)(3) of the Act provides that the term Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable in amountÃ¢Â€? shall have the meaning given such term by the Secretary in regulation. Finally, section 13406(a)(4) of the Act clarifies that Ã¢Â€Âœdirect or indirect paymentÃ¢Â€? does not include any payment for treatment of the individual. We believe Congress intended with these provisions to curtail a covered entity's ability to use the exceptions to the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœmarketingÃ¢Â€? in the Privacy Rule to send communications to the individual that were motivated more by commercial gain or other commercial purpose rather than for the purpose of the individual's health care, despite the communication's being about a health-related product or service., 86175=Submit comments on or before September 13, 2010., 152685=Section 13410(b)(1) makes the provisions of section 13410(a) effective February 18, 2011., 151859=Section 13410(a) of the HITECH Act adds a new subsection (c) to section 1176 of the Social Security Act:, 434457=Second, as we did in the final Privacy Rule published August 14, 2002 (67 FR 53182, 53264-53266) we will provide sample language for revising the contracts between covered entities and business associates. While the language is generic and may not suit complex organizations with complex agreements, we believe that it will help small entities with their contract revisions and save them time and money in redrafting their contracts to conform to the new rules., 392392=The Federalism implications of the Privacy and Security Rules were assessed as required by Executive Order 13132 and published as part of the preambles to the final rules on December 28, 2000 (65 FR 82462, 82797) and February 20, 2003 (68 FR 8334, 8373), respectively. Regarding preemption, the preamble to the final Privacy Rule explains that the HIPAA statute dictates the relationship between State law and Privacy Rule requirements, and the Rule's preemption provisions do not raise Federalism issues. The HITECH Act, at section 13421(a), provides that the HIPAA preemption provisions shall apply to the HITECH provisions and requirements. While we have made minor technical changes to the preemption provisions in Subpart B of Part 160 to conform to and incorporate the HITECH Act preemption provisions, these changes do not raise new Federalism issues. The proposed changes include: (1) Amending the definitions of Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœmore stringentÃ¢Â€? to reference business associates; and (2) further amending the definition of contrary to provide that State law would be contrary to the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions if it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of not only HIPAA, but also the HITECH Act., 322193=Section 13406(b) of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, requires the Secretary to provide by rule that a covered entity provide the recipient of any fundraising communication with a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt out of receiving any further fundraising communications. Additionally, section 13406(b) states that if an individual does opt out of receiving further fundraising communications, the individual's choice to opt out must be treated as a revocation of authorization under Ã‚Â§ 164.508 of the Privacy Rule., 137745=68 FR 8339, Feb. 20, 2003., 437337=As a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5), the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is required to revise its information collection under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164). ARRA was enacted on February 17, 2009. This supporting statement revises a previously approved OCR data collection, OMB # 0990-0294. The HITECH Act requires modification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104-191) implementing regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, to extend jurisdiction to business associates and to strengthen privacy and security protections for health information., 576264=4. We propose to reserve Ã‚Â§ 164.502(a)(3) for provisions implementing modifications to the Privacy Rule required by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which were proposed on October 7, 2009. See 74 FR 51698., 384404=We have prepared a regulatory impact statement in compliance with Executive Order 12866 (September 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, 96), the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4), and Executive Order 13132 on Federalism., 140432=The HITECH Act at section 13400, which became effective February 18, 2010, includes a definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? to mean Ã¢Â€Âœeach of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.Ã¢Â€? This definition varies from paragraph (2) of the HIPAA definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? at Ã‚Â§ 160.103, which does not include reference to American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Thus, for consistency with the definition applied to the HIPAA Rules by the HITECH Act, we propose to add reference to American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in paragraph (2) of the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? at Ã‚Â§ 160.103., 116428=While passage of the HITECH Act necessitates much of the rulemaking below, it does not account for all of the proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules encompassed in this rulemaking. The Department is taking this opportunity to improve the workability and effectiveness of all three sets of HIPAA Rules. The Privacy Rule has not been amended since 2002, and the Security Rule has not been amended since 2003. While the Enforcement Rule was amended in the October 30, 2009, interim final rule to incorporate the enforcement-related HITECH statutory changes that are already effective, it has not been otherwise substantively amended since 2006. In the intervening years, HHS has accumulated a wealth of experience with these rules, both from public contact in various forums and through the process of enforcing the rules. In addition, we have identified a number of needed technical corrections to the rules. Accordingly, we propose a number of modifications that we believe will eliminate ambiguities in the rules and/or make them more workable and effective. Further, we propose a few modifications to conform the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provisions in the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA). We address the substantive proposed changes in the section-by-section description of the proposed rule below. Technical corrections are discussed at the end of the section-by-section description of the other proposed amendments to the rules., 488213=(b) For violations occurring prior to February 18, 2009, the Secretary may not impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity for a violation if the covered entity establishes that an affirmative defense exists with respect to the violation, including the following:, 465730=The provisions of this subpart implement section 1178 of the Act, as added by section 262 of Public Law 104-191, section 264(c) of Public Law 104-191, and section 13421(a) of Public Law 111-5., 576741=5. http://www.bls.gov/oes/2008/may/oes231011.htm for lawyers., 161057=It should be noted that this amendment would not change the substance of the response set forth in the April 18, 2005, preamble to the proposed Enforcement Rule, at 70 FR 20224, 20245-6, regarding objections to the 60-day time limit for filing a request for a hearing. In that response, HHS indicated that it was not reasonable to assume that a notice of proposed determination would be served on a respondent with no warning because the covered entity would necessarily be made aware of, and have the opportunity to address, HHS's compliance concerns throughout the investigative period preceding the notice of proposed determination. This proposed change to Ã‚Â§ 160.312 would allow the Secretary to proceed directly to a notice of proposed determination without first attempting to resolve the matter informally. This proposed revision does not change the fact that during the course of a complaint investigation or a compliance review, a covered entity or business associate would be made aware of, and have the opportunity to address, HHS's compliance concerns., 89309=Andra Wicks, 202-205-2292., 327669=In addition to the above modifications proposed in response to the HITECH Act, we also solicit public comment on the requirement at Ã‚Â§ 164.514(f)(1) which limits the information a covered entity may use or disclose for fundraising demographic information about and dates of health care service provided to an individual. Since the promulgation of the Privacy Rule, certain covered entities have raised concerns regarding this limitation, maintaining that the Privacy Rule's prohibition on the use or disclosure of certain treatment information without an authorization, such as the department of service where care was received and outcomes information, harms their ability to raise funds from often willing and grateful patients. In particular, covered entities have argued that the restrictions in the Privacy Rule prevent them from targeting their fundraising efforts and avoiding inappropriate solicitations to individuals who may have had a bad treatment outcome, and obtaining an individual's authorization for fundraising as the individual enters or leaves the hospital for treatment is often impracticable or inappropriate. NCVHS also held a hearing and heard public testimony on this issue in July 2004. After considering the testimony provided, the NCVHS recommended to the Secretary that the Privacy Rule should allow covered entities to use or disclose information related to the patient's department of service (broad designations, such as surgery or oncology, but not narrower designations or information relating to diagnosis or treating physician) for fundraising activities without patient authorization. NCVHS also recommended that a covered entity's notice of privacy practices inform patients that their department of service information may be used in fundraising, and that patients should be afforded the opportunity to opt out of the use of their department of service information for fundraising or all fundraising contacts altogether. See http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/040902lt1.htm., 265305=We understand that covered entities and business associates are concerned with the anticipated administrative burden and cost to implement the revised business associate contract provisions of the Privacy and Security Rules. Covered entities may have existing contracts that are not set to terminate or expire until after the compliance date of the modifications to the Rules, and we understand that a six month compliance period may not provide enough time to reopen and renegotiate all contracts. In response to these concerns, we propose to relieve some of the burden on covered entities and business associates in complying with the revised business associate provisions by adding a transition provision to grandfather certain existing contracts for a specified period of time. The Department's authority to add the transition provision is set forth in Ã‚Â§ 160.104(c), which allows the Secretary to establish the compliance date for any modified standard or implementation specification, taking into account the extent of the modification and the time needed to comply with the modification. We also note that the Final Privacy Rule, 65 FR 82462 (Dec. 28, 2000), and the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 67 FR 53182 (Aug. 14, 2002), both included transition provisions to ensure that important functions of the health care system were not impeded (e.g., to prevent disruption of ongoing research). Similarly, the proposed transition period, here, will prevent rushed and hasty changes to thousands of on-going existing business associate agreements. The following discussion addresses the issue of the business associate transition provisions., 299052=Subsequent to its issuing this interpretation, the Department has heard concerns from covered entities and researchers that the Department's interpretation encumbers secondary research, and limits an individual's ability to agree to the use or disclosure of their protected health information for future research without having to be re-contacted to sign multiple authorization forms at different points in the future. In addition, many commenters noted that the Department's interpretation limiting the scope of a HIPAA authorization for research appeared to diverge from the current practice under the Common Rule with respect to the ability of a researcher to seek subjects' consent to future research so long as the future research uses are described in sufficient detail to allow an informed consent. These commenters, as well as the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Human Research Protections in 2004 (Recommendation IV, in a letter to the Secretary of HHS, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/hipaalettertosecy090104.html) and the IOM in its 2009 Report entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœBeyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through ResearchÃ¢Â€? (Recommendation II.B.1), have urged the Department to allow the HIPAA authorization to permit future research use and disclosure of protected health information or, at a minimum, for the Department to modify its interpretation to allow the authorization to encompass certain future use and disclosure of protected health information for research, provided certain parameters are met., 53164=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 53832=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 297774=The Department has interpreted the Privacy Rule, however, to require that authorizations for research be study specific for purposes of complying with the Rule's requirement at Ã‚Â§ 164.508(c)(1)(iv) that an authorization must include a description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. See 67 FR 53182, 53226, Aug. 14, 2002. In part, the Department's interpretation was based on a concern that patients could lack necessary information in the authorization to make an informed decision about the future research, due to a lack of information about the future research at the time the authorization was obtained. In addition, it was recognized that not all uses and disclosures of protected health information for a future research purpose would require a covered entity to re-contact the individual to obtain another authorization, to the extent other conditions in the Privacy Rule were met. For example, a covered entity could obtain a waiver of authorization from an IRB or Privacy Board as provided under Ã‚Â§ 164.512(i) or use or disclose only a limited data set pursuant to a data use agreement under Ã‚Â§ 164.514(e) for the future research purpose., 166010=As described above, section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act revised section 1176 of the Social Security Act to establish four tiers of increasing penalty amounts to correspond to the levels of culpability associated with the violation. The first category of violation (and lowest penalty tier) covers situations where the covered entity or business associate did not know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, of a violation. The second category of violation (and next highest penalty tier) applies to violations due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The third and fourth categories (and second-highest and highest penalty tiers) apply to circumstances where the violation was due to willful neglect that is corrected within a certain time period and willful neglect that is not so corrected, respectively. The importance of mens rea, or state of mind, in determining the degree of culpability is clear with respect to the first, third, and fourth categories, in that there is no mens rea with respect to the lowest category of violation, while the existence of mens rea is presumed with respect to the third and fourth categories of violation., 245072=The Privacy Rule currently does not directly govern business associates. However, the provisions of the HITECH Act make specific requirements of the Privacy Rule applicable to business associates, and create direct liability for noncompliance by business associates with regard to those Privacy Rule requirements. In particular, section 13404 of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, addresses the application of the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to business associates of covered entities. Section 13404(a) discusses the application of contract requirements to business associates, paragraph (b) applies the provision of Ã‚Â§ 164.504(e)(1)(ii) regarding knowledge of a pattern of activity or practice that constitutes a material breach or violation of a contract to business associates, and paragraph (c) applies the HIPAA civil and criminal penalties to business associates. We discuss paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 13404 of the HITECH Act below. We address section 13404(c) regarding the application of penalties to violations by business associates above in the discussion of the proposed changes to the Enforcement Rule., 196975=Section 160.410 currently implements the limitations placed on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty under section 1176(b) of the Act. As amended by the IFR, Ã‚Â§ 160.410 is organized to implement section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act in a way that distinguishes the affirmative defenses available to covered entities and business associates prior to, on, or after February 18, 2009, the day after section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act became effective. See 74 FR 56123, Oct. 30, 2009, for a detailed discussion of the IFR's recent amendments., 435247=Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), agencies are required to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public comment before a collection of information requirement is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we solicit comment on the following issues:, 378610=We propose to make a number of technical and conforming changes to the Privacy Rule to fix minor problems such as incorrect cross-references, mistakes of grammar, and typographical errors. Technical and conforming changes of this nature are described and explained in the table below., 102205=Section 13410 of the Act addresses enforcement in a number of ways. First, section 13410(a) provides that the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a criminal penalty has been imposed, rather than in cases in which the offense in question merely constitutes an offense criminally punishable. In addition, section 13410(a) of the Act requires the Secretary to formally investigate any complaint where a preliminary investigation of the facts indicates a possible violation due to willful neglect and to impose a penalty where a violation is found in such cases. Section 13410(c) of the Act provides, for purposes of enforcement, for the transfer to the HHS Office for Civil Rights of any civil money penalty or monetary settlement collected under the Privacy and Security Rules and also requires the Department to establish by regulation a methodology for distributing to harmed individuals a percentage of the civil money penalties and monetary settlements collected under the Privacy and Security Rules. Effective as of February 18, 2009, section 13410(d) of the Act also modified the civil money penalty structure for violations of the HIPAA Rules by implementing a tiered increase in the amount of penalties based on culpability. In addition, as of February 18, 2009, section 13410(e) of the Act also granted State Attorneys General the authority to enforce the HIPAA Rules by bringing civil actions on behalf of State residents in court., 96692=The HITECH Act, enacted on February 17, 2009, is designed to promote the widespread adoption and standardization of health information technology. Subtitle D of title XIII, entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœPrivacy,Ã¢Â€? supports this goal by adopting amendments designed to strengthen the privacy and security protections of health information established by HIPAA. These provisions include extending the applicability of certain of the Privacy and Security Rules' requirements to the business associates of covered entities; requiring HIPAA covered entities and business associates to provide for notification of breaches of Ã¢Â€Âœunsecured protected health informationÃ¢Â€?; establishing new limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information for marketing and fundraising purposes; prohibiting the sale of protected health information; requiring the consideration of a limited data set as the minimum necessary amount of information; and expanding individuals' rights to access and receive an accounting of disclosures of their protected health information, and to obtain restrictions on certain disclosures of protected health information to health plans. In addition, subtitle D adopts provisions designed to strengthen and expand HIPAA's enforcement provisions. We provide a brief overview of the relevant statutory provisions below., 517065=42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 and 1320d-4; sec. 264 of Pub. L. 104-191, 110 Stat. 2033-2034 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 (note)); and secs. 13400-13424, Pub. L. 111-5, 123 Stat. 258-279., 199853=We propose to revise this section to incorporate a reference to the provision of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 at 42 U.S.C. 299b-22 that provides that penalties are not to be imposed under both that act and the Privacy Rule for the same violation., 206205=The Security Rule, as it presently stands, does not directly apply to business associates of covered entities. However, section 13401 of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, provides that the Security Rule's administrative, physical, and technical safeguards requirements in Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§ 164.308, 164.310, and 164.312, as well as its policies and procedures and documentation requirements in Ã‚Â§ 164.316, shall apply to business associates in the same manner as these requirements apply to covered entities, and that business associates shall be civilly and criminally liable for penalties for violations of these provisions., 114018=We also expect that for future modifications to the HIPAA Rules, in most cases, a 180-day compliance period will suffice. Accordingly, we propose to add a provision at Ã‚Â§ 160.105 to address the compliance date generally for implementation of new or modified standards in the HIPAA Rules. Proposed Ã‚Â§ 160.105 would provide that with respect to new standards or implementation specifications or modifications to standards or implementation specifications in the HIPAA Rules, except as otherwise provided, covered entities and business associates must comply with the applicable new standards or implementation specifications or modifications to standards or implementation specifications no later than 180 days from the effective date of any such change. Where future modifications to the HIPAA Rules necessitate a longer compliance period, we would provide so accordingly in the regulatory text. We propose to retain the compliance date provisions at Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§ 164.534 and 164.318, which provide the compliance dates of April 14, 2003, and April 20, 2005, for initial implementation of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, respectively, for historical purposes only., 487170=(1) Prior to February 18, 2011, impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity or business associate for an act that violates an administrative simplification provision if the covered entity or business associate establishes that the violation is punishable under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6., 487678=(2) On or after February 18, 2011, impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity or business associate for an act that violates an administrative simplification provision if the covered entity or business associate establishes that a penalty has been imposed under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6 with respect to such act., 145940=Section 13410 of the HITECH Act made several amendments that directly impact the Enforcement Rule, which applies to the Secretary's enforcement of all of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Rules, as well as the recently promulgated Breach Notification Rule. We issued an interim final rule on October 30, 2009, 74 FR 56123, to address the HITECH Act amendments impacting the Enforcement Rule that became effective on February 18, 2009. For context, we describe those modifications to the Enforcement Rule briefly below. We then provide a section-by-section description of the other section 13410 amendments that are part of this proposed rule., 385746=We estimate that the effects of the requirement for covered entities (including indirect costs incurred by third party administrators, which frequently send out notices on behalf of health plans) to issue new notices of privacy practices, will result in new costs of $166.1 million within 12 months of the effective date of the final rule. We estimate that the private sector will bear approximately 71 percent of the costs, with State and Federal plans bearing the remaining 29 percent of the costs. As a result of the economic impact, and other costs that are expected but not quantified in the regulatory analysis below, we determined that this proposed rule is an economically significant regulatory action within the meaning of section 3(f)(4) of Executive Order 12866. We present our analysis of the costs of the proposed rule in section C below., 370090=We also propose to amend Ã‚Â§ 164.524(c)(4)(ii) to provide separately for the cost of supplies for creating the paper copy or electronic media (i.e., physical media such as a compact disc (CD) or universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), if the individual requests that the electronic copy be provided on portable media. This reorganization and the addition of the phrase Ã¢Â€Âœelectronic mediaÃ¢Â€? reflects our understanding that since section 13405(e)(2) of the HITECH Act permits only the inclusion of labor costs in the charge for electronic copies, it by implication excludes charging for the supplies that are used to create an electronic copy of the individual's protected health information, such as the hardware (computers, scanners, etc.) or software that is used to generate an electronic copy of an individual's protected health information in response to an access request. We note this limitation is in contrast to a covered entity's ability to charge for supplies for hard copies of protected health information (e.g., the cost of paper, the prorated cost of toner and wear and tear on the printer). See 65 FR 82462, 82735, Dec. 28, 2000 (responding to a comment seeking clarification on Ã¢Â€Âœcapital cost for copyingÃ¢Â€? and other supply costs by indicating that a covered entity was free to recoup all of their reasonable costs for copying). We believe this interpretation is consistent with the fact that, unlike a hard copy, which generally exists on paper, an electronic copy exists independent of media, and can be transmitted securely via multiple methods (e.g., e-mail, a secure Web-based portal, or an individual's own electronic media) without accruing any ancillary supply costs., 385022=Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules that have economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any one year) or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal government or communities (58 FR 51741)., 136832=The term Ã¢Â€Âœelectronic mediaÃ¢Â€? was originally defined in the Transactions and Code Sets Rule issued on August 17, 2000 (65 FR 50312) and was included in the definitions at Ã‚Â§ 162.103.

More specifically, the IFR revised subpart D of the Enforcement Rule to transfer the definitions of Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable cause,Ã¢Â€? Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable diligence,Ã¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœwillful neglectÃ¢Â€? from Ã‚Â§ 160.410(a) to a new definitions section at Ã‚Â§ 160.401. The IFR revised Ã‚Â§ 160.404 to incorporate, for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, the new penalty scheme required by section 13410(d), as follows: For violations in which it is established that the covered entity did not know and, by exercising reasonable diligence, would not have known that the covered entity violated a provision, an amount not less than $100 or more than $50,000 for each violation; for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, an amount not less than $1000 or more than $50,000 for each violation; for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to willful neglect and was timely corrected, an amount not less than $10,000 or more than $50,000 for each violation; and for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to willful neglect and was not timely corrected, an amount not less than $50,000 for each violation; except that a penalty for violations of the same requirement or prohibition under any of these categories may not exceed $1,500,000 in a calendar year. It also revised the affirmative defenses in Ã‚Â§ 160.410 for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, to remove a covered entity's lack of knowledge as an affirmative defense and to provide an affirmative defense when violations not due to willful neglect are corrected within 30 days. Finally, the IFR added a requirement that a notice of proposed determination pursuant to Ã‚Â§ 160.420 also reference the applicable category of violation. Readers are encouraged to refer to the IFR for a more detailed discussion of these topics as well as the Enforcement Rule's statutory and regulatory background. See 74 FR 56123, 56124, Oct. 30, 2009., 573821=Dated: April 9, 2010., 341695=Section 13405(a) of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, requires that when an individual requests a restriction on disclosure pursuant to Ã‚Â§ 164.522, the covered entity agree to the requested restriction unless otherwise required by law, if the request for restriction is on disclosures of protected health information to a health plan for the purpose of carrying out payment or health care operations and if the restriction applies to protected health information that pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the health care provider involved has been paid out of pocket in full. This statutory requirement overrides the provision in Ã‚Â§ 164.522(a)(1)(ii) that the covered entity is not required to agree to requests for restrictions and requires that we modify the regulation., 290708=The impact of these authorization requirements and limitations can be seen during clinical trials that are associated with a corollary research activity, such as when protected health information is used or disclosed to create or to contribute to a central research database or repository. For example, Ã‚Â§ 164.508(b)(3)(iii) prevents covered entities from obtaining a single authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information for a research study that includes both treatment as part of a clinical trial and tissue banking of specimens (and associated protected health information) collected, since a research-related treatment authorization generally is conditioned and a tissue banking authorization generally is not conditioned. Various groups, including researchers and professional organizations, have expressed concern at this lack of integration. The Secretary's Advisory Committee for Human Research Protections in 2004 (Recommendation V, in a letter to the Secretary of HHS, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/hipaalettertosecy090104.html), as well as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2009 Report, Ã¢Â€ÂœBeyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through ResearchÃ¢Â€? (Recommendation II.B.2), also made specific recommendations to allow combined authorizations for clinical trials and biospecimen storage. Research-related treatment offered through a clinical trial is nearly always conditioned upon signing the informed consent to participate in the trial and the authorization to use or disclose the individual's protected health information for the trial. Thus, covered entities must obtain separate authorizations from research participants for a clinical trial that also collects specimens with associated protected health information for a central repository. For clinical research trials that may have thousands of participants, documenting and storing twice as many authorizations is a major concern. There is also a concern that multiple forms may be confusing for research subjects. The Department has received reports that recruitment into clinical trials has been hampered, in part, because the multiplicity of forms for research studies dissuades individuals from participating in research. We have also heard that redundant information provided by two authorization forms (one for the clinical study and another for related research) diverts an individual's attention from other content that describes how and why the personal health information may be used., 492465=42 U.S.C. 1302(a); 42 U.S.C. 1320dÃ¢Â€Â”1320d-8; sec. 264, Pub.

L. 111-5, 123 Stat. 258-279., 400880=Actuarial Research Corporation (ARC), our consultant, estimated the number of policy holders for all classes of insurance products to be approximately 183.6 million, including all public programs. The data comes from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2004-2006 projected to 2010. ARC estimated 112.6 million private sector policy holders and 71.0 million public Ã¢Â€Âœpolicy holders.Ã¢Â€? The total, including more recent Medicare data, is 188.3 million persons (which results in roughly a split of 60 percent private policy holders and 40 percent public Ã¢Â€Âœpolicy holdersÃ¢Â€?), whom we expect to receive NPPs from their plans. The estimates do not capture policy holders who are in hospitals or nursing homes at the time of the survey, or individuals who may have been insured under more than one plan in a year, for example, because their job status changed, they have supplemental policies, or they have more than one employer, creating duplicate coverage. Therefore, ARC recommended we use 200 million for the number of NPPs that will actually be sent., 198982=As an additional conforming change, HHS also proposes to amend Ã‚Â§ 160.410(a)(3)(i) (which has been redesignated as Ã‚Â§ 160.410(b)(2)(i)) to replace the term Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable causeÃ¢Â€? with the unrevised text of its current definition. This will ensure that the current definition is applied to violations occurring prior to February 18, 2009, thereby avoiding any potential issues regarding a retroactive application of the revised term., 110541=As noted above, section 13423 of the Act provides that the provisions in subtitle D took effect one year after enactment, i.e., on February 18, 2010, except as specified otherwise. There are a number of exceptions to this general rule. Some provisions were effective the day after enactment, i.e., February 18, 2009. For example, the tiered and increased civil money penalty provisions of section 13410(d) were effective for violations occurring after the date of enactment. Sections 13402 and 13407 of the Act regarding breach notification required interim final rules within 180 days of enactment, with effective dates 30 days after the publication of such rules. Other provisions of the Act have later effective dates. For example, the provision at section 13410(a)(1) of the Act providing that the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a criminal penalty has been imposed, rather than in cases in which the offense in question merely constitutes an offense that is criminally punishable, becomes effective for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2011. The rules proposed below generally pertain to the statutory provisions that became effective on February 18, 2010, or, in a few cases, on a later date., 358494=Section 13405(e) of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, strengthens the Privacy Rule's right of access with respect to covered entities that use or maintain an electronic health record on an individual. Section 13405(e) provides that when a covered entity uses or maintains an electronic health record with respect to protected health information of an individual, the individual shall have a right to obtain from the covered entity a copy of such information in an electronic format and the individual may direct the covered entity to transmit such copy directly to the individual's designee, provided that any such choice is clear, conspicuous, and specific. Section 13405(e) also provides that any fee imposed by the covered entity for providing such an electronic copy shall not be greater than the entity's labor costs in responding to the request for the copy., 388515=Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates would require spending in any one year $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2010, that threshold is approximately $135 million. UMRA does not address the total cost of a rule. Rather, it focuses on certain categories of cost, mainly those Ã¢Â€ÂœFederal mandateÃ¢Â€? costs resulting from: (1) Imposing enforceable duties on State, local, or Tribal governments, or on the private sector; or (2) increasing the stringency of conditions in, or decreasing the funding of, State, local, or Tribal governments under entitlement programs., 146669=In addition, sections 13401 and 13404 of the HITECH Act impose direct civil money penalty liability on business associates for violations of the HITECH Act and certain Privacy and Security Rule provisions. In doing so, sections 13401(b) and 13404(c) of the Act provide that section 1176 of the Social Security Act shall apply to a violation by a business associate Ã¢Â€Âœin the same mannerÃ¢Â€? as it would apply to a covered entity with respect to such a violation. Both provisions are, by virtue of section 13423, effective February 18, 2010., 390971=Similarly, we estimate that approximately 29 percent or $48 million of the new costs will fall on State and Federal plans. As noted above, based on the data discussed in section C below, we estimate that 40 percent of policy holders are served by public sector plans and, therefore, have allocated 40 percent of the costs for all health plans as public sector costs, or $48 million. Because the amount of unfunded mandates incurred separately by either the private sector or by State, local, and Tribal governments will not exceed the unfunded mandates threshold of $133 million, we are not required to perform a cost-benefit analysis under the UMRA. Nonetheless, we have prepared a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed rule in sections C and D, below, as required by Executive Order 12866 for an economically significant regulation. We welcome public comment on the analysis as it bears upon our assumptions and calculations under the UMRA., 164847=Reasonable cause is currently defined, at Ã‚Â§ 160.401, to mean Ã¢Â€Âœcircumstances that would make it unreasonable for the covered entity, despite the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence, to comply with the administrative simplification provision violated.Ã¢Â€? This definition is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 245 (1985), which focused on whether circumstances were beyond the regulated person's control, thereby making compliance unreasonable. See 70 FR 20224, 20238. Prior to the HITECH Act, section 1176 of the Social Security Act treated reasonable cause as a partial limitation on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty. That is, by establishing that a violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and was either corrected within a 30-day period or such additional period as the Secretary determined to be appropriate, a covered entity or business associate would bar the Secretary's imposition of a civil money penalty., 197636=Section 13410(a)(1) revises section 1176(b) to replace the phrase, Ã¢Â€Âœif the act constitutes an offense punishable under section 1177Ã¢Â€? with Ã¢Â€Âœa penalty has been imposed under section 1177 with respect to such act.Ã¢Â€?

Further, we request comment generally on whether the provision which allows a covered entity an additional 30 days to provide access to the individual if the protected health information is maintained off-site should be eliminated altogether for both paper and electronic records, or at least for protected health information maintained or archived electronically because the physical location of electronic data storage is not relevant to its accessibility. We are also interested in public comment on whether, contrary to our assumption, a variety of timeliness standards based on the type of electronic designated record set is the preferred approach and if so, how we should operationalize such an approach. For example, how should we identify and characterize the various electronic designated record sets to which the different standards would apply, such as personal health","Section 164.510(a)(1)(ii) permits the disclosure of directory information to members of the clergy and other persons who ask for the individual by name.

Section 164.510(b)(3) covers uses and disclosures of protected health information when the individual is not present to agree or object to the use or disclosure, and, as pertinent here, permits disclosure to persons only of Ã¢Â€Âœthe protected health information that is directly relevant to the person's involvement with the individual's health care.Ã¢Â€?

L. 104-191), which added a new part C to title XI of the Social Security Act (sections 1171-1179 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-1320d-8). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which was enacted as title XIII of division A and title IV of division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, modifies certain provisions of the Social Security Act pertaining to the Administrative Simplification Rules (HIPAA Rules) and requires certain modifications to the HIPAA Rules themselves., 143706=The term Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? is currently defined in Ã‚Â§ 160.202 to make clear when the preemption provisions of HIPAA apply to State law. Consistent with the limited application of the HIPAA provisions to covered entities only, the current definition of the term Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? does not include reference to business associates. However, section 13421(a) of the HITECH Act provides that the HIPAA preemption provision (section 1178 of the Social Security Act) applies to the provisions and requirements under the HITECH Act Ã¢Â€Âœin the same mannerÃ¢Â€? as it would apply under the HIPAA provisions. Thus, the preemption provisions would apply to business associates, who are now, by virtue of the HITECH Act, required to comply with certain provisions of the HIPAA Rules and are subject to penalties for noncompliance, as discussed elsewhere. Thus, we propose to amend the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? by inserting references to business associates in paragraph (1) of the definition. We also expand the reference to the HITECH statutory provisions in paragraph (2) of the definition to encompass all of the sections of subtitle D of the HITECH Act, rather than merely to section 13402, which was added by the breach notifications regulations. These changes would give effect to section 13421(a)., 197987=HHS proposes to amend Ã‚Â§ 160.410 to implement the revision of section 1176(b)(1) of the Social Security Act by providing in a new paragraph (a)(1) that the affirmative defense of criminally Ã¢Â€ÂœpunishableÃ¢Â€? is applicable to penalties imposed prior to February 18, 2011. A new paragraph (a)(2) in that section would make clear that, on or after February 18, 2011, the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that a penalty has been imposed under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6 with respect to such act.

The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœPrivacy Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued on December 28, 2000, and amended on August 14, 2002. See 65 FR 82462, as amended at 67 FR 53182. The Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœSecurity Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued on February 20, 2003. See 68 FR 8334. The Compliance and Investigations, Imposition of Civil Money Penalties, and Procedures for Hearings regulations, collectively known as the Ã¢Â€ÂœEnforcement Rule,Ã¢Â€? were issued as an interim final rule on April 17, 2003 (68 FR 18895), and revised and issued as a final rule, following rulemaking, on February 16, 2006 (71 FR 8390)., 221035=We propose to amend paragraph (1) of the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœhealth care operationsÃ¢Â€? to include a reference to patient safety activities, as defined in the PSQIA implementing regulation at 42 CFR 3.20. Many health care providers participating in the voluntary patient safety program authorized by PSQIA are HIPAA covered entities; PSQIA acknowledges that such providers must also comply with the Privacy Rule and deems patient safety activities to be health care operations under the Privacy Rule. While such activities are already encompassed within paragraph (1) of the definition, which addresses various quality activities, we propose to expressly include patient safety activities within paragraph (1) of the definition of health care operations to expressly conform the definition to PSQIA and to eliminate the potential for any confusion. This modification would also address public comments the Department received during the rulemaking period for the PSQIA implementing regulations, which urged the Department to modify the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœhealth care operationsÃ¢Â€? in the Privacy Rule to expressly reference patient safety activities so that the intersection of the Privacy and PSQIA Rules would be clear.

The language regarding a component of the Department of Transportation was included to refer to the Coast Guard; however, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. In addition, at Ã‚Â§ 164.512(k)(5)(i)(E), we propose to replace the word Ã¢Â€ÂœandÃ¢Â€? after the semi-colon with the word Ã¢Â€Âœor.Ã¢Â€? The intent of Ã‚Â§ 164.512(k)(5)(i) is not that the existence of all of the conditions is necessary to permit the disclosure, but rather that the existence of any would permit the disclosure., 71516=The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Ã¢Â€Âœthe DepartmentÃ¢Â€?) is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (Privacy Rule), the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (Security Rule), and the rules pertaining to Compliance and Investigations, Imposition of Civil Money Penalties, and Procedures for Hearings (Enforcement Rule) issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The purpose of these modifications is to implement recent statutory amendments under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (Ã¢Â€Âœthe HITECH ActÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€Âœthe ActÃ¢Â€?), to strengthen the privacy and security protection of health information, and to improve the workability and effectiveness of these HIPAA Rules., 108469=As noted above, certain of the HITECH Act's privacy and security provisions have already been the subject of rulemakings and related actions. In particular, the Department published interim final regulations to implement the breach notification provisions at section 13402 of the Act for HIPAA covered entities and business associates in the Federal Register on August 24, 2009 (74 FR 42740), effective September 23, 2009. Similarly, the FTC published final regulations implementing the breach notification provisions at section 13407 for personal health record vendors and their third party service providers on August 25, 2009 (74 FR 42962), effective September 24, 2009. For purposes of determining to what information the HHS and FTC breach notification regulations apply, the Department also issued, first on April 17, 2009 (published in the Federal Register on April 27, 2009, 74 FR 19006), and then later with its interim final rule, the guidance required by the HITECH Act under 13402(h) specifying the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. In addition, to conform the provisions of the Enforcement Rule to the new tiered and increased civil money penalty structure made effective by the HITECH Act on the day after enactment, or February 18, 2009, the Department published an interim final rule on October 30, 2009 (74 FR 56123), effective November 30, 2009., 172865=Prior rulemaking preambles discussing the Enforcement Rule explain the concept of knowledge, as it applies to the limitations (i.e., affirmative defenses) that section 1176(b) of the Social Security Act places on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty. As they explain, Ã¢Â€Âœthe knowledge involved must be knowledge that [a] violation has occurred, not just knowledge of the facts constituting the violation.Ã¢Â€?See 71 FR 8390, 8410, Feb. 16, 2006. Moreover, a covered entity or business associate cannot assert an affirmative defense associated with its Ã¢Â€Âœlack of knowledgeÃ¢Â€? if such lack of knowledge has resulted from its failure to inform itself about compliance obligations or to investigate received complaints or other information indicating likely noncompliance. See 70 FR 20224, 20237-8, Apr. 18, 2005 and 71 FR 8390, 8410-11, Feb. 16, 2006., 438974=We have integrated this PRA notice into the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, because these costs represent costs to be incurred as one-time, first year implementation costs. The estimated annualized burden table below was developed using the same estimates and workload assumptions in the impact statement in the section regarding Executive Order 12866, above. Because the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules have been in effect for several years, these numbers, as revised pursuant to the HITECH modifications, are based on past experience with the current information collection., 111933=We note that the final rule will not take effect until after most of the provisions of the HITECH Act became effective on February 18, 2010. We recognize that it will be difficult for covered entities and business associates to comply with the statutory provisions until after we have finalized our changes to the HIPAA Rules. In addition, we recognize that covered entities and business associates will need some time beyond the effective date of the final rule to come into compliance with the final rule's provisions. In light of these considerations, we intend to provide covered entities and business associates with 180 days beyond the effective date of the final rule to come into compliance with most of the rule's provisions. We believe that providing a 180-day compliance period best comports with section 1175(b)(2) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d-4, and our implementing provision at 45 CFR 160.104(c)(1), which require the Secretary to provide at least a 180-day period for covered entities to comply with modifications to standards and implementation specifications in the HIPAA Rules. While the Social Security Act and the HIPAA Rules permit the Secretary to further delay the compliance date for small health plans, we do not believe that it is necessary to do so for this rule both because most of the changes being proposed are discrete modifications to existing requirements of the HIPAA Rules, as well as because the Department is proposing an additional one-year transition period to modify certain business associate agreements, which should provide sufficient relief to all covered entities, including small health plans. The Department welcomes comment on the assumption that it is not necessary to extend the compliance date for small health plans., 225080=Section 13406(a) of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, addresses these marketing provisions. In particular, section 13406(a) of the HITECH Act limits the health-related communications that may be considered health care operations and thus, that are excepted from the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœmarketingÃ¢Â€? under the Privacy Rule to the extent a covered entity receives or has received direct or indirect payment in exchange for making the communication. In cases where the covered entity would receive such payment, the HITECH Act at section 13406(a)(2)(B) requires that the covered entity obtain the individual's valid authorization prior to making the communication, or, if applicable, prior to its business associate making the communication on its behalf in accordance with its written contract. Section 13406(a)(2)(A) of the HITECH Act includes an exception to the payment limitation for communications that describe only a drug or biologic that is currently being prescribed to the individual as long as any payment received by the covered entity in exchange for making the communication is reasonable in amount. Section 13406(a)(3) of the Act provides that the term Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable in amountÃ¢Â€? shall have the meaning given such term by the Secretary in regulation. Finally, section 13406(a)(4) of the Act clarifies that Ã¢Â€Âœdirect or indirect paymentÃ¢Â€? does not include any payment for treatment of the individual. We believe Congress intended with these provisions to curtail a covered entity's ability to use the exceptions to the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœmarketingÃ¢Â€? in the Privacy Rule to send communications to the individual that were motivated more by commercial gain or other commercial purpose rather than for the purpose of the individual's health care, despite the communication's being about a health-related product or service., 86175=Submit comments on or before September 13, 2010., 152685=Section 13410(b)(1) makes the provisions of section 13410(a) effective February 18, 2011., 151859=Section 13410(a) of the HITECH Act adds a new subsection (c) to section 1176 of the Social Security Act:, 434457=Second, as we did in the final Privacy Rule published August 14, 2002 (67 FR 53182, 53264-53266) we will provide sample language for revising the contracts between covered entities and business associates. While the language is generic and may not suit complex organizations with complex agreements, we believe that it will help small entities with their contract revisions and save them time and money in redrafting their contracts to conform to the new rules., 392392=The Federalism implications of the Privacy and Security Rules were assessed as required by Executive Order 13132 and published as part of the preambles to the final rules on December 28, 2000 (65 FR 82462, 82797) and February 20, 2003 (68 FR 8334, 8373), respectively. Regarding preemption, the preamble to the final Privacy Rule explains that the HIPAA statute dictates the relationship between State law and Privacy Rule requirements, and the Rule's preemption provisions do not raise Federalism issues. The HITECH Act, at section 13421(a), provides that the HIPAA preemption provisions shall apply to the HITECH provisions and requirements. While we have made minor technical changes to the preemption provisions in Subpart B of Part 160 to conform to and incorporate the HITECH Act preemption provisions, these changes do not raise new Federalism issues. The proposed changes include: (1) Amending the definitions of Ã¢Â€ÂœcontraryÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœmore stringentÃ¢Â€? to reference business associates; and (2) further amending the definition of contrary to provide that State law would be contrary to the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions if it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of not only HIPAA, but also the HITECH Act., 322193=Section 13406(b) of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, requires the Secretary to provide by rule that a covered entity provide the recipient of any fundraising communication with a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt out of receiving any further fundraising communications. Additionally, section 13406(b) states that if an individual does opt out of receiving further fundraising communications, the individual's choice to opt out must be treated as a revocation of authorization under Ã‚Â§ 164.508 of the Privacy Rule., 137745=68 FR 8339, Feb. 20, 2003., 437337=As a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5), the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is required to revise its information collection under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164). ARRA was enacted on February 17, 2009. This supporting statement revises a previously approved OCR data collection, OMB # 0990-0294. The HITECH Act requires modification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. 104-191) implementing regulations at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, to extend jurisdiction to business associates and to strengthen privacy and security protections for health information., 576264=4. We propose to reserve Ã‚Â§ 164.502(a)(3) for provisions implementing modifications to the Privacy Rule required by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which were proposed on October 7, 2009. See 74 FR 51698., 384404=We have prepared a regulatory impact statement in compliance with Executive Order 12866 (September 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, 96), the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4), and Executive Order 13132 on Federalism., 140432=The HITECH Act at section 13400, which became effective February 18, 2010, includes a definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? to mean Ã¢Â€Âœeach of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.Ã¢Â€? This definition varies from paragraph (2) of the HIPAA definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? at Ã‚Â§ 160.103, which does not include reference to American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Thus, for consistency with the definition applied to the HIPAA Rules by the HITECH Act, we propose to add reference to American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in paragraph (2) of the definition of Ã¢Â€ÂœStateÃ¢Â€? at Ã‚Â§ 160.103., 116428=While passage of the HITECH Act necessitates much of the rulemaking below, it does not account for all of the proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules encompassed in this rulemaking. The Department is taking this opportunity to improve the workability and effectiveness of all three sets of HIPAA Rules. The Privacy Rule has not been amended since 2002, and the Security Rule has not been amended since 2003. While the Enforcement Rule was amended in the October 30, 2009, interim final rule to incorporate the enforcement-related HITECH statutory changes that are already effective, it has not been otherwise substantively amended since 2006. In the intervening years, HHS has accumulated a wealth of experience with these rules, both from public contact in various forums and through the process of enforcing the rules. In addition, we have identified a number of needed technical corrections to the rules. Accordingly, we propose a number of modifications that we believe will eliminate ambiguities in the rules and/or make them more workable and effective. Further, we propose a few modifications to conform the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provisions in the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA). We address the substantive proposed changes in the section-by-section description of the proposed rule below. Technical corrections are discussed at the end of the section-by-section description of the other proposed amendments to the rules., 488213=(b) For violations occurring prior to February 18, 2009, the Secretary may not impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity for a violation if the covered entity establishes that an affirmative defense exists with respect to the violation, including the following:, 465730=The provisions of this subpart implement section 1178 of the Act, as added by section 262 of Public Law 104-191, section 264(c) of Public Law 104-191, and section 13421(a) of Public Law 111-5., 576741=5. http://www.bls.gov/oes/2008/may/oes231011.htm for lawyers., 161057=It should be noted that this amendment would not change the substance of the response set forth in the April 18, 2005, preamble to the proposed Enforcement Rule, at 70 FR 20224, 20245-6, regarding objections to the 60-day time limit for filing a request for a hearing. In that response, HHS indicated that it was not reasonable to assume that a notice of proposed determination would be served on a respondent with no warning because the covered entity would necessarily be made aware of, and have the opportunity to address, HHS's compliance concerns throughout the investigative period preceding the notice of proposed determination. This proposed change to Ã‚Â§ 160.312 would allow the Secretary to proceed directly to a notice of proposed determination without first attempting to resolve the matter informally. This proposed revision does not change the fact that during the course of a complaint investigation or a compliance review, a covered entity or business associate would be made aware of, and have the opportunity to address, HHS's compliance concerns., 89309=Andra Wicks, 202-205-2292., 327669=In addition to the above modifications proposed in response to the HITECH Act, we also solicit public comment on the requirement at Ã‚Â§ 164.514(f)(1) which limits the information a covered entity may use or disclose for fundraising demographic information about and dates of health care service provided to an individual. Since the promulgation of the Privacy Rule, certain covered entities have raised concerns regarding this limitation, maintaining that the Privacy Rule's prohibition on the use or disclosure of certain treatment information without an authorization, such as the department of service where care was received and outcomes information, harms their ability to raise funds from often willing and grateful patients. In particular, covered entities have argued that the restrictions in the Privacy Rule prevent them from targeting their fundraising efforts and avoiding inappropriate solicitations to individuals who may have had a bad treatment outcome, and obtaining an individual's authorization for fundraising as the individual enters or leaves the hospital for treatment is often impracticable or inappropriate. NCVHS also held a hearing and heard public testimony on this issue in July 2004. After considering the testimony provided, the NCVHS recommended to the Secretary that the Privacy Rule should allow covered entities to use or disclose information related to the patient's department of service (broad designations, such as surgery or oncology, but not narrower designations or information relating to diagnosis or treating physician) for fundraising activities without patient authorization. NCVHS also recommended that a covered entity's notice of privacy practices inform patients that their department of service information may be used in fundraising, and that patients should be afforded the opportunity to opt out of the use of their department of service information for fundraising or all fundraising contacts altogether. See http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/040902lt1.htm., 265305=We understand that covered entities and business associates are concerned with the anticipated administrative burden and cost to implement the revised business associate contract provisions of the Privacy and Security Rules. Covered entities may have existing contracts that are not set to terminate or expire until after the compliance date of the modifications to the Rules, and we understand that a six month compliance period may not provide enough time to reopen and renegotiate all contracts. In response to these concerns, we propose to relieve some of the burden on covered entities and business associates in complying with the revised business associate provisions by adding a transition provision to grandfather certain existing contracts for a specified period of time. The Department's authority to add the transition provision is set forth in Ã‚Â§ 160.104(c), which allows the Secretary to establish the compliance date for any modified standard or implementation specification, taking into account the extent of the modification and the time needed to comply with the modification. We also note that the Final Privacy Rule, 65 FR 82462 (Dec. 28, 2000), and the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 67 FR 53182 (Aug. 14, 2002), both included transition provisions to ensure that important functions of the health care system were not impeded (e.g., to prevent disruption of ongoing research). Similarly, the proposed transition period, here, will prevent rushed and hasty changes to thousands of on-going existing business associate agreements. The following discussion addresses the issue of the business associate transition provisions., 299052=Subsequent to its issuing this interpretation, the Department has heard concerns from covered entities and researchers that the Department's interpretation encumbers secondary research, and limits an individual's ability to agree to the use or disclosure of their protected health information for future research without having to be re-contacted to sign multiple authorization forms at different points in the future. In addition, many commenters noted that the Department's interpretation limiting the scope of a HIPAA authorization for research appeared to diverge from the current practice under the Common Rule with respect to the ability of a researcher to seek subjects' consent to future research so long as the future research uses are described in sufficient detail to allow an informed consent. These commenters, as well as the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Human Research Protections in 2004 (Recommendation IV, in a letter to the Secretary of HHS, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/hipaalettertosecy090104.html) and the IOM in its 2009 Report entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœBeyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through ResearchÃ¢Â€? (Recommendation II.B.1), have urged the Department to allow the HIPAA authorization to permit future research use and disclosure of protected health information or, at a minimum, for the Department to modify its interpretation to allow the authorization to encompass certain future use and disclosure of protected health information for research, provided certain parameters are met., 53164=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 53832=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 297774=The Department has interpreted the Privacy Rule, however, to require that authorizations for research be study specific for purposes of complying with the Rule's requirement at Ã‚Â§ 164.508(c)(1)(iv) that an authorization must include a description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. See 67 FR 53182, 53226, Aug. 14, 2002. In part, the Department's interpretation was based on a concern that patients could lack necessary information in the authorization to make an informed decision about the future research, due to a lack of information about the future research at the time the authorization was obtained. In addition, it was recognized that not all uses and disclosures of protected health information for a future research purpose would require a covered entity to re-contact the individual to obtain another authorization, to the extent other conditions in the Privacy Rule were met. For example, a covered entity could obtain a waiver of authorization from an IRB or Privacy Board as provided under Ã‚Â§ 164.512(i) or use or disclose only a limited data set pursuant to a data use agreement under Ã‚Â§ 164.514(e) for the future research purpose., 166010=As described above, section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act revised section 1176 of the Social Security Act to establish four tiers of increasing penalty amounts to correspond to the levels of culpability associated with the violation. The first category of violation (and lowest penalty tier) covers situations where the covered entity or business associate did not know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, of a violation. The second category of violation (and next highest penalty tier) applies to violations due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The third and fourth categories (and second-highest and highest penalty tiers) apply to circumstances where the violation was due to willful neglect that is corrected within a certain time period and willful neglect that is not so corrected, respectively. The importance of mens rea, or state of mind, in determining the degree of culpability is clear with respect to the first, third, and fourth categories, in that there is no mens rea with respect to the lowest category of violation, while the existence of mens rea is presumed with respect to the third and fourth categories of violation., 245072=The Privacy Rule currently does not directly govern business associates. However, the provisions of the HITECH Act make specific requirements of the Privacy Rule applicable to business associates, and create direct liability for noncompliance by business associates with regard to those Privacy Rule requirements. In particular, section 13404 of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, addresses the application of the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to business associates of covered entities. Section 13404(a) discusses the application of contract requirements to business associates, paragraph (b) applies the provision of Ã‚Â§ 164.504(e)(1)(ii) regarding knowledge of a pattern of activity or practice that constitutes a material breach or violation of a contract to business associates, and paragraph (c) applies the HIPAA civil and criminal penalties to business associates. We discuss paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 13404 of the HITECH Act below. We address section 13404(c) regarding the application of penalties to violations by business associates above in the discussion of the proposed changes to the Enforcement Rule., 196975=Section 160.410 currently implements the limitations placed on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty under section 1176(b) of the Act. As amended by the IFR, Ã‚Â§ 160.410 is organized to implement section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act in a way that distinguishes the affirmative defenses available to covered entities and business associates prior to, on, or after February 18, 2009, the day after section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act became effective. See 74 FR 56123, Oct. 30, 2009, for a detailed discussion of the IFR's recent amendments., 435247=Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), agencies are required to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public comment before a collection of information requirement is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we solicit comment on the following issues:, 378610=We propose to make a number of technical and conforming changes to the Privacy Rule to fix minor problems such as incorrect cross-references, mistakes of grammar, and typographical errors. Technical and conforming changes of this nature are described and explained in the table below., 102205=Section 13410 of the Act addresses enforcement in a number of ways. First, section 13410(a) provides that the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a criminal penalty has been imposed, rather than in cases in which the offense in question merely constitutes an offense criminally punishable. In addition, section 13410(a) of the Act requires the Secretary to formally investigate any complaint where a preliminary investigation of the facts indicates a possible violation due to willful neglect and to impose a penalty where a violation is found in such cases. Section 13410(c) of the Act provides, for purposes of enforcement, for the transfer to the HHS Office for Civil Rights of any civil money penalty or monetary settlement collected under the Privacy and Security Rules and also requires the Department to establish by regulation a methodology for distributing to harmed individuals a percentage of the civil money penalties and monetary settlements collected under the Privacy and Security Rules. Effective as of February 18, 2009, section 13410(d) of the Act also modified the civil money penalty structure for violations of the HIPAA Rules by implementing a tiered increase in the amount of penalties based on culpability. In addition, as of February 18, 2009, section 13410(e) of the Act also granted State Attorneys General the authority to enforce the HIPAA Rules by bringing civil actions on behalf of State residents in court., 96692=The HITECH Act, enacted on February 17, 2009, is designed to promote the widespread adoption and standardization of health information technology. Subtitle D of title XIII, entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœPrivacy,Ã¢Â€? supports this goal by adopting amendments designed to strengthen the privacy and security protections of health information established by HIPAA. These provisions include extending the applicability of certain of the Privacy and Security Rules' requirements to the business associates of covered entities; requiring HIPAA covered entities and business associates to provide for notification of breaches of Ã¢Â€Âœunsecured protected health informationÃ¢Â€?; establishing new limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information for marketing and fundraising purposes; prohibiting the sale of protected health information; requiring the consideration of a limited data set as the minimum necessary amount of information; and expanding individuals' rights to access and receive an accounting of disclosures of their protected health information, and to obtain restrictions on certain disclosures of protected health information to health plans. In addition, subtitle D adopts provisions designed to strengthen and expand HIPAA's enforcement provisions. We provide a brief overview of the relevant statutory provisions below., 517065=42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 and 1320d-4; sec. 264 of Pub. L. 104-191, 110 Stat. 2033-2034 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 (note)); and secs. 13400-13424, Pub. L. 111-5, 123 Stat. 258-279., 199853=We propose to revise this section to incorporate a reference to the provision of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 at 42 U.S.C. 299b-22 that provides that penalties are not to be imposed under both that act and the Privacy Rule for the same violation., 206205=The Security Rule, as it presently stands, does not directly apply to business associates of covered entities. However, section 13401 of the HITECH Act, which became effective on February 18, 2010, provides that the Security Rule's administrative, physical, and technical safeguards requirements in Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§ 164.308, 164.310, and 164.312, as well as its policies and procedures and documentation requirements in Ã‚Â§ 164.316, shall apply to business associates in the same manner as these requirements apply to covered entities, and that business associates shall be civilly and criminally liable for penalties for violations of these provisions., 114018=We also expect that for future modifications to the HIPAA Rules, in most cases, a 180-day compliance period will suffice. Accordingly, we propose to add a provision at Ã‚Â§ 160.105 to address the compliance date generally for implementation of new or modified standards in the HIPAA Rules. Proposed Ã‚Â§ 160.105 would provide that with respect to new standards or implementation specifications or modifications to standards or implementation specifications in the HIPAA Rules, except as otherwise provided, covered entities and business associates must comply with the applicable new standards or implementation specifications or modifications to standards or implementation specifications no later than 180 days from the effective date of any such change. Where future modifications to the HIPAA Rules necessitate a longer compliance period, we would provide so accordingly in the regulatory text. We propose to retain the compliance date provisions at Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â§ 164.534 and 164.318, which provide the compliance dates of April 14, 2003, and April 20, 2005, for initial implementation of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, respectively, for historical purposes only., 487170=(1) Prior to February 18, 2011, impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity or business associate for an act that violates an administrative simplification provision if the covered entity or business associate establishes that the violation is punishable under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6., 487678=(2) On or after February 18, 2011, impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity or business associate for an act that violates an administrative simplification provision if the covered entity or business associate establishes that a penalty has been imposed under 42 U.S.C. 1320d-6 with respect to such act., 145940=Section 13410 of the HITECH Act made several amendments that directly impact the Enforcement Rule, which applies to the Secretary's enforcement of all of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Rules, as well as the recently promulgated Breach Notification Rule. We issued an interim final rule on October 30, 2009, 74 FR 56123, to address the HITECH Act amendments impacting the Enforcement Rule that became effective on February 18, 2009. For context, we describe those modifications to the Enforcement Rule briefly below. We then provide a section-by-section description of the other section 13410 amendments that are part of this proposed rule., 385746=We estimate that the effects of the requirement for covered entities (including indirect costs incurred by third party administrators, which frequently send out notices on behalf of health plans) to issue new notices of privacy practices, will result in new costs of $166.1 million within 12 months of the effective date of the final rule. We estimate that the private sector will bear approximately 71 percent of the costs, with State and Federal plans bearing the remaining 29 percent of the costs. As a result of the economic impact, and other costs that are expected but not quantified in the regulatory analysis below, we determined that this proposed rule is an economically significant regulatory action within the meaning of section 3(f)(4) of Executive Order 12866. We present our analysis of the costs of the proposed rule in section C below., 370090=We also propose to amend Ã‚Â§ 164.524(c)(4)(ii) to provide separately for the cost of supplies for creating the paper copy or electronic media (i.e., physical media such as a compact disc (CD) or universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), if the individual requests that the electronic copy be provided on portable media. This reorganization and the addition of the phrase Ã¢Â€Âœelectronic mediaÃ¢Â€? reflects our understanding that since section 13405(e)(2) of the HITECH Act permits only the inclusion of labor costs in the charge for electronic copies, it by implication excludes charging for the supplies that are used to create an electronic copy of the individual's protected health information, such as the hardware (computers, scanners, etc.) or software that is used to generate an electronic copy of an individual's protected health information in response to an access request. We note this limitation is in contrast to a covered entity's ability to charge for supplies for hard copies of protected health information (e.g., the cost of paper, the prorated cost of toner and wear and tear on the printer). See 65 FR 82462, 82735, Dec. 28, 2000 (responding to a comment seeking clarification on Ã¢Â€Âœcapital cost for copyingÃ¢Â€? and other supply costs by indicating that a covered entity was free to recoup all of their reasonable costs for copying). We believe this interpretation is consistent with the fact that, unlike a hard copy, which generally exists on paper, an electronic copy exists independent of media, and can be transmitted securely via multiple methods (e.g., e-mail, a secure Web-based portal, or an individual's own electronic media) without accruing any ancillary supply costs., 385022=Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules that have economically significant effects ($100 million or more in any one year) or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal government or communities (58 FR 51741)., 136832=The term Ã¢Â€Âœelectronic mediaÃ¢Â€? was originally defined in the Transactions and Code Sets Rule issued on August 17, 2000 (65 FR 50312) and was included in the definitions at Ã‚Â§ 162.103. That definition was subsequently revised and moved to Ã‚Â§ 160.103. The purpose of the revision was to clarify thatÃ¢Â€Â”, 52525=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 489701=(c) For violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, the Secretary may not impose a civil money penalty on a covered entity or business associate for a violation if the covered entity or business associate establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the violation isÃ¢Â€Â”, 574499=[FR Doc. 2010-16718 Filed 7-8-10; 8:45 am], 148347=As noted above, the Department issued an interim final rule (IFR) on October 30, 2009, revising the Enforcement Rule to incorporate the provisions required by section 13410(d) of the HITECH Act that immediately took effect: Four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, the corresponding tiers of civil money penalty amounts, and the revised limitations placed on the Secretary's authority to impose penalties. More specifically, the IFR revised subpart D of the Enforcement Rule to transfer the definitions of Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable cause,Ã¢Â€? Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable diligence,Ã¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœwillful neglectÃ¢Â€? from Ã‚Â§ 160.410(a) to a new definitions section at Ã‚Â§ 160.401. The IFR revised Ã‚Â§ 160.404 to incorporate, for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, the new penalty scheme required by section 13410(d), as follows: For violations in which it is established that the covered entity did not know and, by exercising reasonable diligence, would not have known that the covered entity violated a provision, an amount not less than $100 or more than $50,000 for each violation; for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, an amount not less than $1000 or more than $50,000 for each violation; for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to willful neglect and was timely corrected, an amount not less than $10,000 or more than $50,000 for each violation; and for a violation in which it is established that the violation was due to willful neglect and was not timely corrected, an amount not less than $50,000 for each violation; except that a penalty for violations of the same requirement or prohibition under any of these categories may not exceed $1,500,000 in a calendar year. It also revised the affirmative defenses in Ã‚Â§ 160.410 for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2009, to remove a covered entity's lack of knowledge as an affirmative defense and to provide an affirmative defense when violations not due to willful neglect are corrected within 30 days. Finally, the IFR added a requirement that a notice of proposed determination pursuant to Ã‚Â§ 160.420 also reference the applicable category of violation. Readers are encouraged to refer to the IFR for a more detailed discussion of these topics as well as the Enforcement Rule's statutory and regulatory background. See 74 FR 56123, 56124, Oct. 30, 2009., 573821=Dated: April 9, 2010., 341695=Section 13405(a) of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, requires that when an individual requests a restriction on disclosure pursuant to Ã‚Â§ 164.522, the covered entity agree to the requested restriction unless otherwise required by law, if the request for restriction is on disclosures of protected health information to a health plan for the purpose of carrying out payment or health care operations and if the restriction applies to protected health information that pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the health care provider involved has been paid out of pocket in full. This statutory requirement overrides the provision in Ã‚Â§ 164.522(a)(1)(ii) that the covered entity is not required to agree to requests for restrictions and requires that we modify the regulation., 290708=The impact of these authorization requirements and limitations can be seen during clinical trials that are associated with a corollary research activity, such as when protected health information is used or disclosed to create or to contribute to a central research database or repository. For example, Ã‚Â§ 164.508(b)(3)(iii) prevents covered entities from obtaining a single authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information for a research study that includes both treatment as part of a clinical trial and tissue banking of specimens (and associated protected health information) collected, since a research-related treatment authorization generally is conditioned and a tissue banking authorization generally is not conditioned. Various groups, including researchers and professional organizations, have expressed concern at this lack of integration. The Secretary's Advisory Committee for Human Research Protections in 2004 (Recommendation V, in a letter to the Secretary of HHS, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp/hipaalettertosecy090104.html), as well as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2009 Report, Ã¢Â€ÂœBeyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through ResearchÃ¢Â€? (Recommendation II.B.2), also made specific recommendations to allow combined authorizations for clinical trials and biospecimen storage. Research-related treatment offered through a clinical trial is nearly always conditioned upon signing the informed consent to participate in the trial and the authorization to use or disclose the individual's protected health information for the trial. Thus, covered entities must obtain separate authorizations from research participants for a clinical trial that also collects specimens with associated protected health information for a central repository. For clinical research trials that may have thousands of participants, documenting and storing twice as many authorizations is a major concern. There is also a concern that multiple forms may be confusing for research subjects. The Department has received reports that recruitment into clinical trials has been hampered, in part, because the multiplicity of forms for research studies dissuades individuals from participating in research. We have also heard that redundant information provided by two authorization forms (one for the clinical study and another for related research) diverts an individual's attention from other content that describes how and why the personal health information may be used., 492465=42 U.S.C. 1302(a); 42 U.S.C. 1320dÃ¢Â€Â”1320d-8; sec. 264, Pub. L. 104-191, 110 Stat. 2033-2034 (42 U.S.C. 1320-2(note)); and secs. 13400Ã¢Â€Â”13424, Pub. L. 111-5, 123 Stat. 258-279., 400880=Actuarial Research Corporation (ARC), our consultant, estimated the number of policy holders for all classes of insurance products to be approximately 183.6 million, including all public programs. The data comes from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2004-2006 projected to 2010. ARC estimated 112.6 million private sector policy holders and 71.0 million public Ã¢Â€Âœpolicy holders.Ã¢Â€? The total, including more recent Medicare data, is 188.3 million persons (which results in roughly a split of 60 percent private policy holders and 40 percent public Ã¢Â€Âœpolicy holdersÃ¢Â€?), whom we expect to receive NPPs from their plans. The estimates do not capture policy holders who are in hospitals or nursing homes at the time of the survey, or individuals who may have been insured under more than one plan in a year, for example, because their job status changed, they have supplemental policies, or they have more than one employer, creating duplicate coverage. Therefore, ARC recommended we use 200 million for the number of NPPs that will actually be sent., 198982=As an additional conforming change, HHS also proposes to amend Ã‚Â§ 160.410(a)(3)(i) (which has been redesignated as Ã‚Â§ 160.410(b)(2)(i)) to replace the term Ã¢Â€Âœreasonable causeÃ¢Â€? with the unrevised text of its current definition. This will ensure that the current definition is applied to violations occurring prior to February 18, 2009, thereby avoiding any potential issues regarding a retroactive application of the revised term., 110541=As noted above, section 13423 of the Act provides that the provisions in subtitle D took effect one year after enactment, i.e., on February 18, 2010, except as specified otherwise. There are a number of exceptions to this general rule. Some provisions were effective the day after enactment, i.e., February 18, 2009. For example, the tiered and increased civil money penalty provisions of section 13410(d) were effective for violations occurring after the date of enactment. Sections 13402 and 13407 of the Act regarding breach notification required interim final rules within 180 days of enactment, with effective dates 30 days after the publication of such rules. Other provisions of the Act have later effective dates. For example, the provision at section 13410(a)(1) of the Act providing that the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty will only be barred to the extent a criminal penalty has been imposed, rather than in cases in which the offense in question merely constitutes an offense that is criminally punishable, becomes effective for violations occurring on or after February 18, 2011. The rules proposed below generally pertain to the statutory provisions that became effective on February 18, 2010, or, in a few cases, on a later date., 358494=Section 13405(e) of the HITECH Act, which became effective February 18, 2010, strengthens the Privacy Rule's right of access with respect to covered entities that use or maintain an electronic health record on an individual. Section 13405(e) provides that when a covered entity uses or maintains an electronic health record with respect to protected health information of an individual, the individual shall have a right to obtain from the covered entity a copy of such information in an electronic format and the individual may direct the covered entity to transmit such copy directly to the individual's designee, provided that any such choice is clear, conspicuous, and specific. Section 13405(e) also provides that any fee imposed by the covered entity for providing such an electronic copy shall not be greater than the entity's labor costs in responding to the request for the copy., 388515=Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates would require spending in any one year $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2010, that threshold is approximately $135 million. UMRA does not address the total cost of a rule. Rather, it focuses on certain categories of cost, mainly those Ã¢Â€ÂœFederal mandateÃ¢Â€? costs resulting from: (1) Imposing enforceable duties on State, local, or Tribal governments, or on the private sector; or (2) increasing the stringency of conditions in, or decreasing the funding of, State, local, or Tribal governments under entitlement programs., 146669=In addition, sections 13401 and 13404 of the HITECH Act impose direct civil money penalty liability on business associates for violations of the HITECH Act and certain Privacy and Security Rule provisions. In doing so, sections 13401(b) and 13404(c) of the Act provide that section 1176 of the Social Security Act shall apply to a violation by a business associate Ã¢Â€Âœin the same mannerÃ¢Â€? as it would apply to a covered entity with respect to such a violation. Both provisions are, by virtue of section 13423, effective February 18, 2010., 390971=Similarly, we estimate that approximately 29 percent or $48 million of the new costs will fall on State and Federal plans. As noted above, based on the data discussed in section C below, we estimate that 40 percent of policy holders are served by public sector plans and, therefore, have allocated 40 percent of the costs for all health plans as public sector costs, or $48 million. Because the amount of unfunded mandates incurred separately by either the private sector or by State, local, and Tribal governments will not exceed the unfunded mandates threshold of $133 million, we are not required to perform a cost-benefit analysis under the UMRA. Nonetheless, we have prepared a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed rule in sections C and D, below, as required by Executive Order 12866 for an economically significant regulation. We welcome public comment on the analysis as it bears upon our assumptions and calculations under the UMRA., 164847=Reasonable cause is currently defined, at Ã‚Â§ 160.401, to mean Ã¢Â€Âœcircumstances that would make it unreasonable for the covered entity, despite the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence, to comply with the administrative simplification provision violated.Ã¢Â€? This definition is consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 245 (1985), which focused on whether circumstances were beyond the regulated person's control, thereby making compliance unreasonable. See 70 FR 20224, 20238. Prior to the HITECH Act, section 1176 of the Social Security Act treated reasonable cause as a partial limitation on the Secretary's authority to impose a civil money penalty. That is, by establishing that a violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and was either corrected within a 30-day period or such additional period as the Secretary determined to be appropriate, a covered entity or business associate would bar the Secretary's imposition of a civil money penalty., 197636=Section 13410(a)(1) revises section 1176(b) to replace the phrase, Ã¢Â€Âœif the act constitutes an offense punishable under section 1177Ã¢Â€? with Ã¢Â€Âœa penalty has been imposed under section 1177 with respect to such act.Ã¢Â€? This statutory change is effective February 18, 2011.}",
