Performance Guranteed: OriGene guarantees that the sequences in the shRNA expression cassettes are verified to correspond to the target gene with 100% identity. One of the four constructs at minimum are guaranteed to produce 70% or more gene expression knock-down provided a minimum transfection efficiency of 80% is achieved. Western Blot data is recommended over qPCR to evaluate the silencing effect of the shRNA constructs 72 hrs post transfection.

Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. This protein can undergo autoproteolytic processing and activation by the apoptosome, a protein complex of cytochrome c and the apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1; this step is thought to be one of the earliest in the caspase activation cascade. This protein is thought to play a central role in apoptosis and to be a tumor suppressor. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

The theatre was listed Grade II on 20 July 1971. Its seating capacity is 1,200 on three levels, a fairly large auditorium. The Aldwych Theatre is amongst the many theatres that are reported to be haunted. The Aldwych theatre opened on 23 December 1905 with a production of Blue Bell, a new version of Hicks' popular pantomime Bluebell in Fairyland. In 1906, Hicks' The Beauty of Bath, followed in 1907 by The Gay Gordons, played at the theatre. In February 1913 the theatre was used by Serge Diaghilev and Vaslav Nijinsky for the first rehearsals of Le Sacre du Printemps before its controversial premiÃƒÂ¨re in Paris later that year. In 1920, Basil Rathbone played Major Wharton in The Unknown. From 1925-1933, it became the home of Ben Travers's farces, also known as The Aldwych Farces. Members of Travers's company included Ralph Lynn, Tom Walls, Yvonne Arnaud, Norma Varden, Mary Brough, Winifred Shotter and Robertson Hare. In 1933, Richard Tauber presented and starred in a new version of Das DreimÃƒÂ¤derlhaus at the Aldwych under the title Lilac Time. From the mid-1930s until about 1960, the theatre was owned by the Abrahams family. On 15 December 1960, after intense speculation, it was announced that the Royal Shakespeare Company of Stratford-upon-Avon was to base its London productions in the Aldwych Theatre for the next three years. In fact they stayed for over 20 years, finally moving to the Barbican Arts Centre in 1982. Among many notable productions were The Wars of the Roses, The Greeks, and Nicholas Nickleby, as well as numerous Shakespeare productions. During absences of the RSC, the theatre hosted the annual World Theatre Seasons, foreign plays in their original productions, invited to London by the theatre impresario Peter Daubeny, annually from 1964 to 1973 and finally in 1975. For his involvement with these Aldwych seasons, run without Arts Council or other official support, Daubeny won the Evening Standard special award in 1972. In 1990-91, Joan Collins starred in a revival of Private Lives at the Aldwych. The theatre is referred to in Julio CortÃƒÂ¡zar's short story Instructions for John Howell (Instrucciones para John Howell) in the anthology All Fires the Fire (Todos los fuegos el fuego). Since 2000, the theatre has hosted a mixture of plays, comedies and musical theatre productions. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Whistle Down the Wind played until 2001, and Fame enjoyed an extended run from 2002 to 2006. From 2006 to 2011, it was the home to the British musical version of Dirty Dancing.}"

This is a made in china bait that costs about $5 to make. If this bait was $25 then it would be decent because I would compare it to other baits in the price range. at $70 You must compare it to other bluegill baits in that range and that's where it fails miserably. The 3:16, Matt's, Rago's, and even the JSJ are far superior quality in just about every aspect. The Got'em bait does get bit but not very often and big fish are even more rare. The bait looks good in the pictures but when you actually hold one in your hands you can see the lack of quality and the overall cheap feel. If the bait was a great producer I could over look this, but it's not. I would rank this bait slightly behind the Ty lures gill. Again $70 is just way to much for this bait and the lack of results. if it was $25 it would be a decent substitute bait if you could not find, or afford a high quality bait.}",,"When you want to put big bass in the boat, the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill Swimbait is the one for you. Ã‚Â Designed to withstand abuse from jagged structure and monster bass, the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill SwimbaitÃ¢Â€Â™s detailed scaling, laser lifelike printing, and 3D eyes create a durable and attractive swimbait that gets bit. A multi-jointed construction brings to life the smooth, natural action and helps it maintain a consistent depth with a moderate-to-fast retrieve.Ã‚Â  Crafted with an incredible attention to detail and the utmost quality, the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill Swimbait comes with two Owner ST-41 hooks - the rear hook is positioned on a rotating swivel to prevent acrobatic fish from coming loose. Rounding out the design of the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill Swimbait is its fiber strand tail that adds an outstanding level of realism to the already impressive appearance.Ã‚Â  Customer Reviews Description Got'Em Coach Real Gill Swimbait - $49.99",Click on the logo to read their review.,True,4,0,

weekend, and the films that beat Thursday's predictions outnumber those that failed to reach expected levels, both in terms of the number of films and in terms of total box office generated. This helped the industry to $165 million at the box office over the weekend; however, this was down about 0.2% from last weekend and 5.4% from the same weekend last year. That said, this is better than most were expecting, and 2009 is still way ahead of 2008's pace at $4.34 billion to $3.85 billion.

This May we might not have any movies reach that milestone. Then again, there are six films that have a shot to reach $200 million. I'm not saying all of them will get there, but I would be surprised if at least two of them don't get there, while all six should reach at least $100 million, which is two more than the same month last year.

Producer Information founded his business in the North Western Italian town of Asti in 1891 when as a young pastry chef he became fascinated with the pairing of food and wine as he looked to expand the range of products on offer in his artisan bakery. Giulio began producing quality aromatic-infused wines and by the turn of the century two in particular - Barolo Chinato and Aperitivo Americano - had become very popular, not only throughout Piedmont but also in the export markets of London, New York, Africa and South America. Giulio Cocchi Spumanti is now owned by the Bava Family, themselves highly renowned wine producers. Today the winery still maintains its artisan character using only traditional techniques to craft the distinctive spirits that have made the Cocchi name synonymous with style and quality. Cocchi's Americano means much more to Asti than a simple wine",True,0,0,

PROBLEM 2: Different needs: Just as for , what unsighted need in text format is different from what sighted need in text format. E.g. imagine that the video\'s firstframe displays text. Solution: allows authors to take care of the difference. PROBLEM 3: Same expectations: The firstframe image creates useful expectations about what to see: When starting a video, the exciting scene (or info) on the firstframe image might be preceded by dull footage or advertising. Someone who sees the firstframe image (all the sighted!) or at least read its description, would be less likely to stop playing the video early than someone with minimal clue about what to expect. Solution: allows authors to build up similar expectations within the unsighted audience as within the sighted audience. B) To a sighted, the firstframe image can have value in itself. Speaking for myself, when news articles contain video I tend to ""jump over"" them, but I still eagerly consume their firstframe images. Thus, a firstframe image without a description is information-loss for the unsighted. An HTML standard where is covered by @alt and its usage guidelines, but were does not have similar possibilities or guidelines, would be a missed opportunity. C) Comments to certain claims: C1) CP says: ""it should be described as part of the description of the video element itself"". But by which feature? is synced with the video file and not with the still picture of the firstframe image. It should be as easy to change the firstframe text as it is to change the firstframe image - one shouldn\'t need to edit whether a file or a video source file. John\'s CP also demoes that the firstframe could specify for whom the film is suitable: one should not need to read a longer, general video description to locate this. Plus that some of the firstframe\'s teaser effects could be lost if the firstframe text is mixed together with a general description of the video. C2) The CP claims that because the firstframe image is ""conceptually part of the media resource itself"" it ""should be described as part of the description of the video element itself"". However, from a different angle, a firstframe image description *would* then be a video description, if but of a detail of it. C3) The name: at first seemed unoptimal (e.g. because John\'s CP says that it could be used for ). However, if we ignore (which has no image feature), and instead consider Sylvia Pfeiffer\'s point (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10642#c76) that the user don\'t know whether the image stems from (in John\'s proposal) or the movie file, then make very good sense. C4) CP says that ""\'poster\' is the term commonly used in the industry"". May be. But for example such a thing as does not seem to exist for whether QuickTime, MediaPlayer or Flash. C5) Comment on a poll comment by Philip JÃƒÂ¤genstedt: Whether the firstframe image text must accurately reflect the firstframe image or simply be a text that could serve as a useful textual teaser, seems like an authoring guide question. For instance, if the video\'s firstframe shows what this CP describes as ""a fade from black, the green MPAA rating, the roaring lion, etc"", then it may not make sense to *require* the firstframe text to reflect this. John\'s CP says the author in such cases MAY omit (note: always requires @alt). However, if the author doesn\'t omit it, could the author then provide a text that was a tad more useful than the firstframe image itself? My answer would be: Yes, but then the author should also update the firstframe image.']]",Results of Questionnaire ISSUE-142: No alternative text description for video key frame (poster) - Straw Poll for Objections - Web-Based Straw-poll and Balloting System,,http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issue-142-objection-poll/results,True,MIXED,RELATION,0,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00240-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,817653371,817635123,VERTICAL,,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 13:08:23 GMT","Details Keep in mind, you must actually state an objection, not merely cite someone else.

"[['Responder', 'Laura Carlson', 'Kornel Lesinski', 'Philip JÃƒÂ¤genstedt', 'Leif Halvard Silli'], ['Objections to the Change Proposal to introduce a new child element to the video element.', '', ""* The proposal confuses poster frames with movie posters. It is not purpose of this attribute to serve as a movie poster, and I have not seen any indication of this happening in practice. * In my experience most videos don't have carefully chosen poster frames that are good description of the video, and many videos have accompanying description which makes description of poster frame unnecessary. * Description of only a single frame Ã¢\x80\x94 which sometimes is not even chosen by the video author Ã¢\x80\x94 can be misleading about video's content. * I think it's unreasonable to expect that authors would describe both video and poster frame separately, and author's effort is better spent on describing the video itself. * In case when poster frame is especially interesting, its description could be made part of the video description (it seems unlikely to me that one would like to learn about the poster and not about the video). The proposal is mainly based on concern that authors *could* use image that contains unique and valuable information about the video. However, this does not happen in practice: Poster frames on sites like YouTube or Vimeo are just one of the frames of the video. These frames are not specially crafted images that would be a good proxy for the entire video contents. Sometimes these frames capture unimportant scenes from the video, or taken out of context give wrong impression of the video. Such accidental misleading poster frames are a problem for me (sighted user), and I don't think we should be giving *equally bad* experience to users who can't see them. Some video poster frames, e.g. on InfoQ website, are just website's logo, which tells nothing about the video itself, and website name is obvious from context. On Guardian and NY Times websites videos seem to have manually chosen poster frames. However, these videos are accompanied by very good descriptions, which are much better than descriptions of poster frames could be (e.g. video about climate change affecting sea life has poster frame with a fisherwoman Ã¢\x80\x94 even a pefect description of the poster frame would be only an incomplete description of the video). Videos on movie-oriented websites don't use movie poster for poster frame. Trailers often start with screen describing video rating, and less often logo of a movie studio. This is valuable information, but description of the first frame would only coincidentally contain it (and e.g. if video has rating screen, then users would not get information about movie studio and vice-versa). Instead of relying on poster frame containing *some* information and poster frame description copying it, we should encourage authors to provide information in more reliable and straightforward manner (e.g. Apple trailers website always includes both rating and studio information in movie description, and poster frames are not reliable source of that information)."", 'I strongly object to describing the poster frame separately from the video to AT users. This distinction is not made for sighted users, who have no way of knowing if what they are seeing is the first frame of a video or a poster frame. The poster frame is ""intended to be a representative frame of the video"" and as such, the description of the video should also be a suitable description of the poster frame. If the poster frames brings attention to any specific aspect of the video, it would be appropriate for the video\'s description to also stress that aspect. Making the suggested disctinction would encourage inappropriate use of the poster frame. I strongly object to removing the poster attribute, as it is already implemented by browsers and used by web pages. Adding a short text alternative for the placeholder/poster image (which I object to) does not require changing this part of the syntax. As a necessary consequence, I also object to renaming the concept from ""poster frame"" to ""first frame"", even though I acknowledge that ""poster frame"" is by no means a perfect name for the feature. I object to introducing a void element that is likely to appear before the elements. In all browsers that do not implemented support for , any following elements would become child elements of and thus would not be considered in the resource selection algorithm. In effect, that video would be completely broken in those browsers. (Yes, this is also a problem with and introducing new void elements in general.) The fact that authors can use any image as the poster frame is not sufficient justification. Any frame of the video can also contain arbitrary content, yet there is no mechanism for providing short text alternatives for specific frames on the HTML level. Further, it seems highly unlikely that people who use the poster incorrectly (to include content that is not representative of the video resource itself) would be aware enough to make the effort of making that inappropriate use accessible. Finally, just like the poster attribute can be used incorrectly, it\'s possible to use multiple elements with media attributes so that wildly different videos are used depending on the environment. Yet, there is no suggestion to provide a separate text alternatives for each . I object to catering for abuse of the poster attribute but not doing the same for elements. Comments on Leif Halvard Silli\'s objections not covered by the above: There is no disagreement that short text alternatives for the video are important. There is no contradiction between ""conceptually part of the media resource itself"" and ""should be described as part of the description of the video element itself"". The point is quite clear: a short text alternative that is representative of the video would also be suitable as a short text alternative for the poster frame, as the poster frame is representative of the video. No one has suggested that the poster frame be explicitly described in the short text alternative of the video, on the form of ""The poster frame contains... and the video itself is about..."". That would just as inappropriate as having a separate description for the poster frame. That does not have a (dedicated) short text alternative is part of the point. Having a dedicated short text alternative for the poster frame but not for the video itself is extremeley backwards. Thus the suggestion that discussion ""move on to short and long text alternatives for a media resource as a whole"". Note that aria-labelledby and aria-describedby are mentioned as potential solutions in the proposal.

Zwischen den Jahren 2011 und 2012 habe sich das an den fÃƒÂ¼nf grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸeren deutschen Crowdfunding-BÃƒÂ¶rsen vergebene Kapital mehr als vervierfacht, errechnete das Frankfurter Beratungsunternehmen FÃƒÂ¼r-GrÃƒÂ¼nder.de.

""Es lÃƒÂ¤uft sehr schleppend, Sponsoren fÃƒÂ¼r ein Projekt zu finden, das noch nicht etabliert ist"", erklÃƒÂ¤rt die 24 Jahre alte Seckler., 38174=Der Trend setzt sich ganz klar fort"", betont RenÃƒÂ© Klein von FÃƒÂ¼r-GrÃƒÂ¼nder.de. Nach einem ersten Rekordquartal kÃƒÂ¶nnte sich 2013 das eingesammelte Kapital auf bis zu sechs Millionen Euro verdreifachen. Im Vergleich zum US-Markt ist das allerdings noch vergleichsweise wenig. Die BÃƒÂ¶rse Kickstarter alleine vermittelte 2012 nach eigenen Angaben rund 274 Millionen US-Dollar (rund 210 Millionen Euro)., 33924=Das Crowdfunding bei P/ART lÃƒÂ¤uft bislang ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerst schleppend. ÃƒÂœber drei Monate ist das Projekt nun schon ausgeschrieben und vier Wochen vor Schluss stehen erst 1000 Euro in den BÃƒÂ¼chern. ""Unsere Zielgruppe hat eher keine Kohle"", begrÃƒÂ¼ndet Seckler . Wird das Ziel von 5000 Euro nicht erreicht, bleibt vom eingesammelten Geld nichts ÃƒÂ¼brig. Es geht dann umgehend zurÃƒÂ¼ck auf die Konten der Spender.}"

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 20702=Though the financial sector has been one of the star performers so far this year, its growth momentum slackened in Q3 with 9.9% earnings growth. This was in stark contrast to 30% earnings growth seen in Q2 for financial equities. In fact, excluding Bank of America (BAC), the sectorÃ¢Â€Â™s Q3 earnings growth slipped to 3.3%. Ã‚Â  Results from two industry bellwethers Ã¢Â€Â“ J.P. Morgan (JPM - Analyst Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS - Analyst Report) Ã¢Â€Â“ were underwhelming. If this was not enough, the credit-rating organization MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s (MCO) downgraded long-term senior unsecured debt of four top-tier U.S. banks including Goldman and J.P. Morgan, to add to the woes. Ã‚Â  WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s Behind the Downgrade? Ã‚Â  Apart from Goldman and JPM, MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s cut its credit rating by a notch for Morgan Stanley (MS) and the Bank of New York Mellon (BK). Ã‚Â As per the agency, the U.S. government might not be ready to intervene and bail out a stressed financial institution in any upcoming crisis as it did five years ago (read: Capital Market ETFs in Focus on Taper Talk). Ã‚Â  This is because of the fact that regulatory instructions under the Dodd-Frank Act are against the taxpayer funded bailouts for rescuing a failed bank. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms also limit banks' ability to go for risky investments and urged institutions to be transparent in financial practices. Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  In the downgrade, the agency mostly considered the banksÃ¢Â€Â™ core health and ruled out any boost from the government. In such a scenario, debt holders of the said banks might have to bear the burden of a credit default in the future.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  On a positive note, MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s reiterated the senior holding company ratings of Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. (C), State Street Corp. (STT) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC). Ã‚Â  Market Impact Ã‚Â  This news led to some modest losses for the concerned companies. Shares of JPMorgan dipped 0.9% in after-hours trading, Goldman Sachs lost 0.2% while Morgan Stanley dropped 0.7%, on MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s announcement day. Ã‚Â  All the aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in funds like theÃ‚Â PowerShares KBW Capital Markets (KBWC), iShares US Broker-Dealers (IAI - ETF report), iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (IYG - ETF report), and the PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (KBWB - ETF report)). Ã‚Â  While KBWC and IAI have 6%Ã¢Â€Â“8% exposure in Goldman and Morgan Stanley, KBWB and IYG put at least 8% assets in JP Morgan (read: Financial ETFs Tumble on Citigroup Warning). Ã‚Â  While we do not believe that only the MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s announcement can hit the above-said financial sector ETFs which have sizeable exposure in better-rated companies as well, these could be the ones to watch out for following any unforeseen hit or miss in the financial sector: Ã‚Â  PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio (KBWB - ETF report) Ã‚Â  This ETF follows the KBW Bank Index and normally invests at least 90% of its total assets constituting the cap weighted index. With about two dozen financial stocks in its basket, the fund has so far amassed $168.8 million in assets. The ETF sees decent volume of about 130,000 shares a day and charges investors 35% of fees to own the fund. In terms of holdings, KBWB is headed by Citigroup and Bank of America while the in-focus JP Morgan takes up the third spot. All three have over 8.0% of holdings in the fund. Large caps dominate the fund at roughly 80% of the total assets, while the portfolio definitely has a value tilt with more than 60% of the fund going to that type of security. Ã‚Â  Following the MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s cut on November 14, the fund advanced only 0.14% while KBWB returned a massive 22.98% on a year-to-date basis (as of September 30, 2013). Ã‚Â The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Low risk outlook (also read Top Ranked Financial ETF in Focus: KBWB). Ã‚Â  PowerShares KBW Capital Markets (KBWC) Ã‚Â  KBWC Ã¢Â€Â“ a relatively less popular choice in the space Ã¢Â€Â“ looks to track the KBW Capital Markets Index. This cap-weighted benchmark reflects the performance of businesses concerning broker-dealers, asset managers, trust and custody banks among others in the space. This fund also has a portfolio of two-dozen stocks and lighter volume of about 3,500 shares a day, along with AUM of just over $9.0 million. Ã‚Â  Morgan Stanley takes the top spot in terms of assets at 9.4%, while another in-focus bank, Goldman, assumes the third spot with more than 7.0% exposure. State Street Ã¢Â€Â“ a stock with reaffirmed rating Ã¢Â€Â“ took the second spot with above 8% weight to round the top three. The fund charges an expense ratio of 0.35% a year. Ã‚Â  In terms of performance, this fund was up about 1.87% in the trailing three-day period despite the downgrade of two key elements. In the first nine months of the year, the fund gained 29.4%. KBWC also carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (see all the Financial ETFs here). Ã‚Â  Other Choices Ã‚Â  The other two products IAI and IYG Ã¢Â€Â“ both of which are exposed to GS, MS and JPM Ã¢Â€Â“ delivered a return of around 0.8% and 0.6% in the concerned period while in the last one-year period (as of September 30, 2013) IAI shot up 50.6% and IYG posted an impressive 34.4% return. Ã‚Â  Both these iShares funds charge 0.45% in fees per year. While IAI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with Medium risk outlook, IYG has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Low risk outlook. Ã‚Â  Bottom Line Ã‚Â  The financial sector has lost some luster but is still in demand. Investors can still count on the sector which is likely to return to revenue growth next year. Bullish Zacks ETF Ranks for most of the funds are also supportive of this view. Ã‚Â  Moreover, financial institutions which are more into the broker-dealer/capital markets segment might get their share of aid next year, if not in December, when the Ã¢Â€Â˜taper talkÃ¢Â€Â™ resumes in all likelihood. Thus, there are clearly plenty of drivers in store for the sector to make up for the disappointment created by MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s downgrade.

In terms of holdings, KBWB is headed by Citigroup and Bank of America while the in-focus JP Morgan takes up the third spot. All three have over 8.0% of holdings in the fund. Large caps dominate the fund at roughly 80% of the total assets, while the portfolio definitely has a value tilt with more than 60% of the fund going to that type of security. Ã‚Â  Following the MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s cut on November 14, the fund advanced only 0.14% while KBWB returned a massive 22.98% on a year-to-date basis (as of September 30, 2013). Ã‚Â The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Low risk outlook (also read Top Ranked Financial ETF in Focus: KBWB). Ã‚Â  PowerShares KBW Capital Markets (KBWC) Ã‚Â  KBWC Ã¢Â€Â“ a relatively less popular choice in the space Ã¢Â€Â“ looks to track the KBW Capital Markets Index. This cap-weighted benchmark reflects the performance of businesses concerning broker-dealers, asset managers, trust and custody banks among others in the space. This fund also has a portfolio of two-dozen stocks and lighter volume of about 3,500 shares a day, along with AUM of just over $9.0 million. Ã‚Â  Morgan Stanley takes the top spot in terms of assets at 9.4%, while another in-focus bank, Goldman, assumes the third spot with more than 7.0% exposure. State Street Ã¢Â€Â“ a stock with reaffirmed rating Ã¢Â€Â“ took the second spot with above 8% weight to round the top three. The fund charges an expense ratio of 0.35% a year. Ã‚Â  In terms of performance, this fund was up about 1.87% in the trailing three-day period despite the downgrade of two key elements. In the first nine months of the year, the fund gained 29.4%. KBWC also carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (see all the Financial ETFs here). Ã‚Â  Other Choices Ã‚Â  The other two products IAI and IYG Ã¢Â€Â“ both of which are exposed to GS, MS and JPM Ã¢Â€Â“ delivered a return of around 0.8% and 0.6% in the concerned period while in the last one-year period (as of September 30, 2013) IAI shot up 50.6% and IYG posted an impressive 34.4% return. Ã‚Â  Both these iShares funds charge 0.45% in fees per year. While IAI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with Medium risk outlook, IYG has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Low risk outlook. Ã‚Â  Bottom Line Ã‚Â  The financial sector has lost some luster but is still in demand. Investors can still count on the sector which is likely to return to revenue growth next year. Bullish Zacks ETF Ranks for most of the funds are also supportive of this view. Ã‚Â  Moreover, financial institutions which are more into the broker-dealer/capital markets segment might get their share of aid next year, if not in December, when the Ã¢Â€Â˜taper talkÃ¢Â€Â™ resumes in all likelihood. Thus, there are clearly plenty of drivers in store for the sector to make up for the disappointment created by MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s downgrade.

Ã‚Â  WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s Behind the Downgrade? Ã‚Â  Apart from Goldman and JPM, MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s cut its credit rating by a notch for Morgan Stanley (MS) and the Bank of New York Mellon (BK). Ã‚Â As per the agency, the U.S. government might not be ready to intervene and bail out a stressed financial institution in any upcoming crisis as it did five years ago (read: Capital Market ETFs in Focus on Taper Talk). Ã‚Â  This is because of the fact that regulatory instructions under the Dodd-Frank Act are against the taxpayer funded bailouts for rescuing a failed bank. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms also limit banks' ability to go for risky investments and urged institutions to be transparent in financial practices. Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  In the downgrade, the agency mostly considered the banksÃ¢Â€Â™ core health and ruled out any boost from the government. In such a scenario, debt holders of the said banks might have to bear the burden of a credit default in the future.Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  On a positive note, MoodyÃ¢Â€Â™s reiterated the senior holding company ratings of Bank of America, Citigroup Inc.

Many of these deliveries are managed by cesarean delivery due to higher neonatal morbidity associated with vaginal breech delivery. Cesarean delivery, the safer option for the baby, however, is associated with a higher incidence of maternal complications for both the current and subsequent pregnancies. External cephalic version is a procedure commonly used to attempt to manually rotate the fetus into vertex position. This facilitates vaginal delivery and thus avoids higher maternal and/or neonatal complications. Obstetricians perform versions after 36 weeks gestational age with a reportable success rate of 30-80%. The most common technique involves external manipulation of the fetal position preceded by pharmacologic uterine relaxation. Pain relief is most commonly provided in the form of intravenous opioids such as fentanyl. A more efficacious form of analgesia is the use of neuraxial opioids and local anesthetics (neuraxial analgesia), a technique commonly used for labor and delivery analgesia. Although the use of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia techniques improve maternal pain and satisfaction, there is conflicting evidence if they improve the success rate of version procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has stated, ""Currently there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation favoring or opposing anesthesia during ECV (external cephalic version) attempts.""

Treatment of patients with IC is aimed at secondary prevention of cardiovascular events by control of risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, and to improve walking distance and subsequently quality of life. Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET) and Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) can effectively improve pain free walking distance, but the optimal choice of treatment, specifically in patients with an iliac artery stenosis or occlusion is unclear. PTA is attractive as initial therapy since PTA of the iliac arteries has an immediate effect and it is durable.

Intraperitoneal aerosolization of Bupivacaine 50 mg after laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain, morphine consumption and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and it is associated with rapid mobilization compared with patients receiving direct instillation of Bupivacaine 50 mg or placebo. In a recent study the investigators found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg with the AeronebProÃ‚Â® before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynecologic laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Patients receiving preoperative nebulization of Ropivacaine presented significantly less postoperative pain (-50% clinical setting) and consumed significant less morphine (-50% and -40% respectively) than patients in control groups during the first 48 hours after surgery. The effects of peritoneal nebulization of ropivacaine during laparoscopic colectomy on pain control and morphine consumption were not evaluated. The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine may produce better pain control and less morphine consumption than nebulization of saline after laparoscopic colectomy.

Die Energieversorgung erfolgt durch vier dreieckige SolarzellenflÃƒÂ¤chen von 6Ã‚Â m Spannweite, die wÃƒÂ¤hrend des Starts nach oben zusammengefaltet sind. Die Lageregelung erfolgt durch Sonnensensoren und Stickstoff-DruckgasdÃƒÂ¼sen.[2] Prognos (russischÃ‚Â ÃÂŸÃ‘Â€ÃÂ¾ÃÂ³ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ·) ist der Name eines sowjetischen wissenschaftlichen Satellitenprogramms. Es bestand aus zehn Satelliten, die zwischen 1972 und 1985 mit Molnija-M-TrÃƒÂ¤gerraketen vom Startkomplex 31/6 des Kosmodroms Baikonur gestartet wurden.[1] Suche Navigation, Wechseln zu: aus Wikipedia, der freien EnzyklopÃƒÂ¤die Prognos (Satellit)","Weblinks[Bearbeiten] Geschichte der Sonden (russisch) Quellen[Bearbeiten] Ã¢Â†Â‘ a b Vorlage:Internetquelle/Wartung/Zugriffsdatum nicht im ISO-FormatVorlage:Internetquelle/Wartung/Datum nicht im ISO-FormatMark Wade: Baikonur LC31.

Through a noisy channel, a receiver might see 8 versions of the output, see table below. FEC is accomplished by adding redundancy to the transmitted information using an algorithm. A redundant bit may be a complex function of many original information bits. The original information may or may not appear literally in the encoded output; codes that include the unmodified input in the output are systematic, while those that do not are non-systematic.

The correcting ability of this FEC is: Up to 1 bit of triplet in error, or up to 2 bits of triplet omitted (cases not shown in table). Though simple to implement and widely used, this triple modular redundancy is a relatively inefficient FEC. Better FEC codes typically examine the last several dozen, or even the last several hundred, previously received bits to determine how to decode the current small handful of bits (typically in groups of 2 to 8 bits). Averaging noise to reduce errors[edit] FEC could be said to work by ""averaging noise""; since each data bit affects many transmitted symbols, the corruption of some symbols by noise usually allows the original user data to be extracted from the other, uncorrupted received symbols that also depend on the same user data. Because of this ""risk-pooling"" effect, digital communication systems that use FEC tend to work well above a certain minimum signal-to-noise ratio and not at all below it. This all-or-nothing tendency Ã¢Â€Â” the cliff effect Ã¢Â€Â” becomes more pronounced as stronger codes are used that more closely approach the theoretical Shannon limit. Interleaving FEC coded data can reduce the all or nothing properties of transmitted FEC codes",False,-1,0,

In 1972, Major League Baseball's Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the Texas Rangers, named after the statewide law enforcement agency. The National Basketball Association expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the Dallas Mavericks were added to the league. The fourth piece was added in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League became the Dallas Stars. The MLS team F.C. Dallas is also based in the Metroplex.

The racial makeup of the CSA was 70.41% White, 13.34% African American, 0.59% Native American, 3.58% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 9.62% from other races, and 2.39% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 20.83% of the population. It is home to the fourth-largest Muslim population in the country.[16], 79721=Denton County has bus service limited to Denton, Highland Village, and Lewisville (with commuter service to downtown Dallas) provided by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). The A-train, a diesel commuter rail line, parallels I-35E to connect Denton, Highland Village, Lewisville, and Carrollton. Several smaller towns along this line, Corinth, Shady Shores, and Lake Dallas, voted to abstain from DCTA and do not have stations. There is an across-the-platform transfer in Carrollton to the DART Green Line. A-Train service began June 20, 2011.[20], 17840=According to the North Texas Commission (NTC), the term originated from an ad agency's combination of the terms ""metropolitan"" and ""complex"". The NTC copyrighted[9] the term ""Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex"" in 1972 as a replacement for the previously-ubiquitous ""North Texas"", which studies had shown lacked identifiability outside the state. In fact, only 38 percent of a survey group identified Dallas and Fort Worth as part of ""North Texas"", with the Texas Panhandle also a perceived correct answer, being the northernmost region of Texas.[10], 76872=The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, located between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, is the largest and busiest airport in the state of Texas. At 100 square kilometres (39Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi) of total land area, DFW is the second largest airport in the country and sixth largest in the world. It is the third busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements and the seventh busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger traffic, transporting 59,784,876 passengers in 2007.[18] American Airlines, based in Fort Worth, has its headquarters adjacent to DFW Airport. American, which recently regained the title as largest airline in the world in terms of passengers transported and fleet size, is a predominant leader in domestic routes and operations.[19], 78459=Public transit options continue to expand significantly, though in several outlying suburbs, it remains limited. Dallas County and parts of Collin and Rockwall Counties have bus service and light rail operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, (DART), covering thirteen member cities. With the completion of projects currently under construction, DART's rail network will grow to 90 miles of track by 2014. The Red Line extends north to Plano and southwest to Westmoreland Road. The Blue Line reaches from Rowlett in the northeast to Ledbetter Road in south Dallas (with an additional 3 miles south to the University of North Texas near I-20 scheduled to open in 2019). DART's most recent addition, the 28-mile Green Line, which opened in December 2010, connects Carrollton in the northwest through Downtown Dallas to Pleasant Grove in the southeast. The Orange Line, which currently parallels the Red Line from Plano to Downtown Dallas and the Green Line from Downtown Dallas to Northwest Hwy, will be extended in phases from Northwest Hwy. to Las Colinas (Irving) in 2012 and finally to DFW International Airport in 2014., 95915=The Metroplex is one of just twelve American metropolitan areas that has a team in each of the four major professional sports leagues. Major professional sports first came to the area in 1960, when the Dallas Cowboys began competing in the National Football League and the Dallas Texans began competing in the American Football League (the Texans would later relocate to Kansas City and become the Chiefs). In 1972, Major League Baseball's Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the Texas Rangers, named after the statewide law enforcement agency. The National Basketball Association expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the Dallas Mavericks were added to the league. The fourth piece was added in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League became the Dallas Stars. The MLS team F.C. Dallas is also based in the Metroplex. The area is also home to many other minor-league professional teams, four colleges that compete in NCAA Division I athletics, and has played host to many premiere sports events on both an annual and one-time basis., 24181=Note: Cities and towns are categorized based on the latest population estimates from the North Central Texas Council of Governments (as of January 1, 2012).[11] No population estimates are released for census-designated places (CDPs), which are marked with an asterisk (*). These places are categorized based on their 2010 census population.[12], 54485=As of the 2010 United States census,[14] there were 6,371,773 people. The racial makeup of the MSA was 50.2% Non-Hispanic White, 15.4% African American, 0.6% Native American, 5.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 10.0% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 27.5% of the population., 94354=Two Metroplex AM radio stations, 820 WBAP and 1080 KRLD, are 50,000-watt stations with coverage of much of the North American continent and beyond during nighttime hours., 9982=The 2014 official estimate U.S. Census has the DallasÃ¢Â€Â“Fort Worth Metroplex at 6,954,330, [4] making it the largest metropolitan area in the South. During the 12-month period from July 2008 to July 2009, the DallasÃ¢Â€Â“Fort WorthÃ¢Â€Â“Arlington metropolitan area gained 146,530 new residents, more than any other metropolitan area in the United States.[5][6] The area's population has grown by about one million since the 2000 US census.[7] The DallasÃ¢Â€Â“Fort WorthÃ¢Â€Â“Arlington MSA is, by population, the largest metropolitan area in Texas, the largest in the South, the fourth-largest in the United States, and the tenth-largest in the Americas. The metroplex encompasses 9,286 square miles (24,100Ã‚Â km2) of total area: 8,991Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi (23,290Ã‚Â km2) is land, while 295Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi (760Ã‚Â km2) is water, making it larger in area than the U.S. states of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined. It is also the sixth largest gross metropolitan product (GMP) in the United States,[8] and approximately tenth largest by GMP in the world., 56445=The Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area is made up of 19 counties in north central Texas and one county in southern Oklahoma. The statistical area includes two metropolitan areas and seven micropolitan areas. As of the 2010 Census, the CSA had a population of 6,817,483 (though a July 1, 2012 estimate placed the population at 7,095,411).[15] The CSA definition encompasses 14,628Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi (37,890Ã‚Â km2) of area, of which 14,126Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi (36,590Ã‚Â km2) is land and 502Ã‚Â sqÃ‚Â mi (1,300Ã‚Â km2) is water., 68067=The cities of Dallas and Fort Worth are the two central cities of the Metroplex. Dallas and its suburbs have one of the highest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the United States. As such, one of the largest industries in the Metroplex is conducting business. The Metroplex also contains the largest Information Technology industry base in the state (often referred to as Silicon Prairie or the Telecom Corridor), owing to the large number of corporate IT projects and the presence of numerous electronics, computing and telecommunication firms such as Texas Instruments, HP Enterprise Services, Dell Services, Nokia, i2, AT&T, Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, CA and Verizon in and around Dallas. On the other end of the business spectrum, and on the other side of the Metroplex, the Texas farming and ranching industry is based in Fort Worth. According to the Dallas Business Journal's 2006 Book of Lists, American Airlines is the largest employer in the Metroplex. Several major defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter Textron, and Raytheon, maintain significant operations in the Metroplex. ExxonMobil, the #2 corporation on the Fortune 500 listings, is headquartered in Irving, Texas.}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 14:42:37 GMT","Largest area private-sector employers[edit] The Dallas-Fort Worth area has thousands of lane-miles of freeways and interstates. The Metroplex has the second largest number of freeway-miles per capita in the nation, behind only the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. Like most major metropolitan areas in Texas, most interstates and freeways have access roads where most of the businesses are located; these access roads have slip ramps that merge onto the freeways and interstates. North-south Interstates include I-35 and I-45. East-west routes include I-30 and I-20. I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W from Denton to Hillsboro: I-35W goes through Fort Worth while I-35E goes through Dallas. (This is one of only two examples of an interstate splitting off into branches and then rejoining into one again; the other split is in Minneapolis-St. Paul where I-35E goes into St. Paul and I-35W goes through Minneapolis). I-30 connects Dallas and Fort Worth, and I-45 connects Dallas to Houston. HOV lanes currently exist along I-35E, I-30, I-635, US 67, and US 75. I-20 bypasses both Dallas","Media[edit] The cities of Dallas and Fort Worth have their own newspapers, The Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, respectively. Historically, the two papers were restricted in readership to their own counties; Tarrant County households would never read the Morning News and vice versa.[citation needed] As the two cities' suburbs have grown together in recent years (and especially since the demise of the Dallas Times Herald in 1991), it is now common to find locations where both of the newspapers are sold. This pattern has been repeated in other print media, radio, and television, but since the 1970s all of the television stations and most of the FM radio stations have chosen to transmit from Cedar Hill so as to serve the entire market, and are programmed likewise. A recent phenomenon seen most clearly in the DFW market has been the rise of ""80-90 move-ins"", whereby stations have been moved from distant markets, in some cases as far away as Oklahoma, and relicensed to anonymous small towns in the Metroplex to serve as additional DFW stations. According to RadioTime, the market has 38 AM stations, 58",True,0,0,

Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed it was a form of cowardice., 39742=Hannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the Gauls of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the latter could take steps to check the rebellion., 106675=Maximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the 1911 EncyclopÃƒÂ¦dia Britannica, praises Hannibal in these words:, 21316=After Carthage's defeat in the First Punic War, Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes. With that in mind and supported by Gades, Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that its navy was unable to transport his army to Iberia (Hispania); instead, Hamilcar had to march it towards the Pillars of Hercules and transport it across the Strait of Gibraltar.[citation needed], 25678=After he assumed command, Hannibal spent two years consolidating his holdings and completing the conquest of Hispania, south of the Ebro.[21] In his first campaign, Hannibal attacked and stormed the Olcades' strongest centre, Alithia, which promptly led to their surrender, and brought Punic power close to the River Tagus. His following campaign in 220 was against the Vaccaei to the west, where he stormed the Vaccaen strongholds of Helmantice and Arbucala. On his return home, laden with many spoils, a coalition of Spanish tribes, led by the Carpetani, attacked, and Hannibal won his first major battlefield success and showed off his tactical skills at the battle of the River Tagus.[22] However, Rome, fearing the growing strength of Hannibal in Iberia, made an alliance with the city of Saguntum, which lay a considerable distance south of the River Ebro and claimed the city as its protectorate. Hannibal not only perceived this as a breach of the treaty signed with Hasdrubal, but as he was already planning an attack on Rome, this was his way to start the war. So he laid siege to the city, which fell after eight months. Rome reacted to this apparent violation of the treaty and demanded justice from Carthage. In view of Hannibal's great popularity, the Carthaginian government did not repudiate Hannibal's actions, and the war he sought was declared at the end of the year. Hannibal was now determined to carry the war into the heart of Italy by a rapid march through Hispania and southern Gaul.[citation needed], 42854=The other Roman consular army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered the Consul Sempronius Longus to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without its loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the Trebia River near Placentia. There, in December of the same year, Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at Trebia; where after wearing down the superior Roman infantry he then cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks., 94567=According to the historian Livy, the Romans feared Hannibal's military genius, and during Hannibal's march against Rome in 211Ã‚Â BC[65] ""a messenger who had travelled from Fregellae for a day and a night without stopping created great alarm in Rome, and the excitement was increased by people running about the City with wildly exaggerated accounts of the news he had brought. The wailing cry of the matrons was heard everywhere, not only in private houses but even in the temples. Here they knelt and swept the temple-floors with their dishevelled hair and lifted up their hands to heaven in piteous entreaty to the gods that they would deliver the City of Rome out of the hands of the enemy and preserve its mothers and children from injury and outrage.""[65] In the Senate the news was ""received with varying feelings as men's temperaments differed,""[65] so it was decided to keep Capua under siege, but to send 15,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry as reinforcements to Rome.[65], 33206=Hannibal recognized that he still needed to cross the Pyrenees, the Alps, and many significant rivers.[26] Additionally, he would have to contend with opposition from the Gauls, whose territory he passed through. Starting in the spring of 218Ã‚Â BC, he crossed the Pyrenees and, by conciliating the Gaulish chiefs along his passage, reached the River RhÃƒÂ´ne before the Romans could take any measures to bar his advance. Arriving at the RhÃƒÂ´ne in September, Hannibal's army numbered 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 38 elephants, almost none of which would survive the harsh conditions of the Alps.[27], 69291=In 210Ã‚Â BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at Herdonia (modern Ordona) in Apulia upon a proconsular army and, in 208Ã‚Â BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of Locri Epizephyri. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209Ã‚Â BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of Samnium and Lucania, his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207Ã‚Â BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother Hasdrubal Barca. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the Metaurus he retired into Bruttium, where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago Barca in Liguria (205Ã¢Â€Â“203Ã‚Â BC) and of his own negotiations with Philip V of Macedon, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203Ã‚Â BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus., 110123=Count Alfred von Schlieffen developed his eponymously titled ""Schlieffen Plan"" (1905/1906) from his military studies, with a particularly heavy emphasis on the envelopment technique which Hannibal employed to surround and destroy the Roman army at Cannae.[75][76] George S. Patton believed himself a reincarnation of Hannibal as well as of many other people, including a Roman legionary and a Napoleonic soldier.[77][78] Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of the Coalition Forces in the Gulf War of 1990-1991, claimed: ""The technology of war may change, the sophistication of weapons certainly changes. But those same principles of war that applied to the days of Hannibal apply today.""[79], 35126=After outmaneuvering the natives, who had tried to prevent his crossing, Hannibal evaded a Roman force marching from the Mediterranean coast by turning inland up the valley of the RhÃƒÂ´ne. His exact route over the Alps has been the source of scholarly dispute ever since. (Polybius, the surviving ancient account closest in time to Hannibal's campaign, reports that the route was already debated.) The most influential modern theories favor either a march up the valley of the DrÃƒÂ´me and a crossing of the main range to the south of the modern highway over the Col de MontgenÃƒÂ¨vre or a march farther north up the valleys of the IsÃƒÂ¨re and Arc crossing the main range near the present Col de Mont Cenis or the Little St Bernard Pass.[28] Recent numismatic evidence suggests that Hannibal's army may have passed within sight of the Matterhorn.[29]}","Mon, 27 Jul 2015 05:13:27 GMT","Hannibal in film and on television[edit] In Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical The Phantom of the Opera and its 2004 film adaption, the Opera Populaire is in rehearsal for an opera by the fictional composer Chalumeau about Hannibal starring the show's secondary antagonists Piangi and Carlotta (who are not necessarily evil, but still are against the show's heroine, Christine DaaÃƒÂ©).

The performance score measures an institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s financial performance and its ability to withstand stress. The loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s failure. The rule will take effect in the second quarter of 2011., 26615=The 2010 Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) was held in Beijing, China, in May and was the second such event held under President ObamaÃ¢Â€Â™s administration. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao agreed to the S&ED in April 2009 to deepen and promote mutually beneficial cooperation between the U.S. and China in key economic and strategic areas. Chairman Bair and staff participated in this yearÃ¢Â€Â™s S&ED and also met with leaders of the PeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s Bank of China and the CBRC in side meetings to further strengthen the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s relationship with these bank regulatory agencies. During the meeting with the CBRC, CBRC Chairman Liu and Chairman Bair signed an MOU enhancing cooperation in times of financial instability and in cases of cross-border resolution., 25018=Throughout 2010, the FDIC participated in Governors and Heads of Supervision and BCBS meetings and contributed to the work streams, task forces, and the Policy Development Group that developed and refined regulatory forms to address a new definition of capital, treatment of counterparty credit risk, an international leverage ratio, capital conservation and countercyclical buffers, liquidity requirements, and surcharges on SIFIs. The BCBS published the final capital and liquidity reforms in December 2010, along with the results of the comprehensive quantitative impact study and an assessment of the macroeconomic impact of the transition to stronger capital and liquidity requirements. In addition to these capital and liquidity reforms, the FDIC also participated in BCBS initiatives related to surveillance standards, remuneration, supervisory colleges, operational risk, accounting issues for consistency, and corporate governance., 2539=The FDIC continued its efforts to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the deposit insurance assessment system by issuing a proposed rule in November 2010, that was finalized in February 2011, and revises the assessment system applicable to large IDIs to better reflect risk at the time a large institution assumes the risk, to better differentiate large institutions during periods of good economic conditions, and to better take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if such an institution fails., 21465=In 2009, the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) jointly published Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems (Core Principles). The Core Principles were later adopted by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which added them to its Compendium of Standards. Under the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership, IADI, BCBS, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI), the World Bank, and the European Commission collaborated in developing a methodology for assessing compliance with the Core Principles. The methodology was submitted for approval by the executive governing boards of IADI, EFDI, and BCBS and presented to the FSB in December 2010. Together, the Core Principles and the methodology will be considered for inclusion among the FSBÃ¢Â€Â™s 12 Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems. Once adopted, the Core Principles methodology is expected to be used to assess deposit insurance systems by the IMF in its Financial Sector Assessment Program, and by the FSB in its peer review of deposit insurance systems, which is scheduled for 2011. The leadership of IADI under Martin J. Gruenberg, the Vice Chairman of the FDIC, has been instrumental in advancing the establishment of the Core Principles as the standards for deposit insurance. Vice Chairman Gruenberg was re-elected to serve as President of IADI and Chair of the Executive Council in November 2010. During his tenure as President, the membership of IADI has grown from 48 to 62 deposit insurance members, including new members from Germany, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Australia, and Paraguay., 4568=On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced and implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). The TLGP consists of two components: (1) the Debt Guarantee Program (DGP)Ã¢Â€Â”an FDIC guarantee of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt; and (2) the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP)Ã¢Â€Â”an FDIC guarantee in full of noninterest-bearing transaction accounts., 8003=The FDIC collected $10.4 billion in fees and surcharges under the DGP. As of December 31, 2010, the FDIC paid $8 million on seven claims that were filed when four participating entities (all holding companies) defaulted on debt issued under the DGP. Further claims on notes issued by one entity are expected, since some of the notes issued by this entity have not yet matured. Losses through the end of the DGP guarantee period in 2012 are expected to be limited., 15116=The Program expanded coverage at large and complex institutions from eight to ten in 2010 and increased its on-site presence, as designated by the FDIC Board, to assess risk, monitor liquidity, and participate in targeted reviews with the primary federal regulators. In July 2010, the FDIC entered into an interagency memorandum of understanding (MOU) which allows FDIC examiners to conduct special examinations of certain institutions covered by the MOU. The MOU should enhance the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s access to those institutions and encourage ongoing effective communication among the federal regulators. The Large Insured Depository Institution (LIDI) Program remains the primary instrument for off-site monitoring of IDIs with $10 billion or more in total assets, or under this threshold at regional discretion. The LIDI Program provides a comprehensive process to standardize data capture and reporting through nationwide quantitative and qualitative risk analysis of large and complex institutions. As of June 30, 2010, the LIDI Program encompassed 110 institutions with total assets of $10.3 trillion. The LIDI Program was refined again in 2010 to better quantify risk to the insurance fund in all large banks. This was accomplished, in collaboration with other divisions and offices, through a revision to the LIDI Scorecard, which better aligns with and supports the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s large-bank deposit insurance pricing responsibilities. The LIDI Scorecard is designed to weigh key risk areas and provide a risk ranking and measurement system that compares IDIs on the basis of both the probability of failure and exposure to loss at failure. The comprehensive LIDI Program is essential to effective large bank supervision by capturing information on the risks and utilizing that information to best deploy resources to high-risk areas, determine the need for supervisory action, and support insurance assessments and resolution planning., 27433=Chairman Bair and staff visited New Delhi and Mumbai, India, in June to meet with senior representatives of public and private sector organizations, including the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development to discuss financial inclusion efforts in the U.S. and India and to explore possible areas of future cooperation between the two countries. Chairman Bair was the keynote speaker at an event hosted by the RBI, which was attended by senior RBI officials, bankers, and financial industry representatives. The ChairmanÃ¢Â€Â™s speech addressed U.S. financial regulatory reform, the importance of promoting financial inclusion and education, and the efforts made by both the U.S. and India to reach their unbanked population. Chairman Bair also announced plans to translate the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s Money Smart program into Hindi for use in India., 6292=The TAGP initially guaranteed in full all domestic noninterest-bearing transaction deposits held at participating banks and thrifts through December 31, 2009. This deadline was extended twice and expired on December 31, 2010. The guarantee also covered negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts at participating institutionsÃ¢Â€Â”provided the institution initially committed to maintain interest rates on the accounts of no more than 0.50 percent (later reduced to 0.25 percent) for the duration of the programÃ¢Â€Â”and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (IOLTAs) and functional equivalents. Participating institutions were initially assessed a 10 basis point surcharge on the portion of covered accounts that were not otherwise insured. The fees for the TAGP were increased at the first extension to either 15 basis points, 20 basis points, or 25 basis points, depending on the institutionÃ¢Â€Â™s deposit insurance assessment category., 12664=The Dodd-Frank Act provides temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012, regardless of the balance in the account and the ownership capacity of the funds. The unlimited coverage is available to all depositors, including consumers, businesses, and government entities. The coverage is separate from, and in addition to, the standard insurance coverage provided for a depositorÃ¢Â€Â™s other accounts held at an FDIC-insured bank., 24147=Since January 2009, international regulators have been meeting periodically to exchange views and share information on developments related to central counterparties (CCPs) for over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivatives. Based on the success of this cooperation, the OTC Derivatives RegulatorsÃ¢Â€Â™ Forum was formed to provide regulators with a means to cooperate, exchange views, and share information related to OTC derivatives, CCPs, and trade repositories. FDIC staff has an active role in the OTC Derivatives RegulatorsÃ¢Â€Â™ Forum and the OTC Derivative SupervisorsÃ¢Â€Â™ Group. Work streams of particular interest include collateral safekeeping practices, dispute resolution, and the build out of the central clearing platforms. Additionally, staff is completing a data access/user agreement MOU to assure ready access to data in trade repositories., 8923=Under the TAGP, the FDIC guaranteed an average of $114 billion of deposits during the fourth quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the last day of the program, over 5,100 FDIC-insured institutions reported having guaranteed deposits. As of December 31, 2010, the FDIC has collected $1.1 billion in fees under the TAGPÃ‚Â². Cumulative estimated TAGP losses on failures as of December 31, 2010, totaled $2.3 billion., 18938=The 20th Annual Derivatives Securities and Risk Management Conference, which the FDIC co-sponsored with Cornell UniversityÃ¢Â€Â™s Johnson Graduate School of Management and the University of HoustonÃ¢Â€Â™s Bauer College of Business, was held in April 2010 at the Seidman Center. The two-day conference attracted over 100 researchers from around the world. Conference presentations focused on issues such as credit risk measurement, equity option pricing, commodity market speculation, and risk management., 4962=Under the DGP, the FDIC initially guaranteed in full, through maturity or June 30, 2012, whichever came first, the senior unsecured debt issued by a participating entity between October 14, 2008, and June 30, 2009, although in 2009 the issuance period was extended through October 31, 2009. The FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s guarantee on each debt instrument also was extended in 2009 to the earlier of the stated maturity date of the debt or December 31, 2012., 25966=The FDIC finalized a resolution and crisis management MOU with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) in 2010. The FDIC is currently in the process of negotiating a similar MOU with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The MOU with FINMA is expected to be finalized by the end of 2011. The FDIC has reached out to other strategic countries including India, and has been met with enthusiasm by Indian officials. In 2011, the FDIC will review its resolution MOU with the Bank of England to determine what, if any, changes need to be made in light of regulatory developments both in the U.S. and the United Kingdom., 10382=The TAGP was designed to eliminate potentially disruptive shifts in deposit funding and thus preserve bank lending capacity. The program proved effective. However, because bank failures continued to grow during 2009 and 2010, the FDIC remained concerned that terminating the TAGP too quickly could reverse the progress made in restoring financial markets to more normal conditions. To help transition institutions out of the TAGP, therefore, the FDIC Board, on August 26, 2009, approved a final rule that extended the TAGP for an additional six months, through June 30, 2010, with higher assessment fees for institutions participating in the extension period. The final rule also provided an opportunity for participating entities to opt out of the TAGP extension. Over 6,400 institutions (or 93 percent of institutions participating at year-end) elected to continue in the TAGP., 19465=In October 2010, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve hosted a two-day symposium on mortgages and the future of housing finance. Over 300 experts from the public, private, and academic sectors participated in discussions of mortgage finance, foreclosures, loan modifications, and securitizations. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair spoke at the symposium regarding the need for reform to restore stability to the housing finance system and to aggressively examine the incentives of the U.S. system of mortgage finance to ensure that the problems that contributed to the financial crisis are addressed., 7721=Over the course of the DGPÃ¢Â€Â™s existence, 121 entities issued TLGP debt. At its peak, the DGP guaranteed almost $350 billion of debt outstanding (see chart below). As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of remaining FDIC-guaranteed debt outstanding was $267 billion., 20103=The CFR and the Journal for Financial Services Research (JFSR) hosted the 10th Annual Bank Research Conference: Finance and Sustainable Growth in October. The two-day conference included the presentation of 17 papers and was attended by over 100 participants. Experts discussed a range of topics, including the global financial crisis, credit derivatives and the default risk of large complex financial institutions, and bank capital adequacy., 18368=In 2010, OCFI focused on creating and staffing senior management positions. Work also began on developing resolution strategies for specific SIFIs and more broadly scoping a process, strategies, and data needs for ongoing risk assessment at SIFIs., 17115=The Office of Complex Financial Institutions (OCFI) was created in 2010 to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions. The OCFI is responsible for oversight and monitoring of large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Specifically, through both on-site and off-site monitoring, OCFI will develop an in-depth understanding of the operations and risk profiles of all IDIs and bank holding companies with assets over $100 billion and other companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)., 18662=The Center for Financial Research (CFR) was founded by the Corporation in 2004 to encourage and support innovative research on topics important to the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s role as deposit insurer and bank supervisor. During 2010, the CFR co-sponsored three major conferences., 5415=The FDIC charged a fee based on the amount and term of the debt issued. Fees ranged from 50 basis points on an annualized basis for debt with a maturity of 180 days or less, increasing to 75 basis points on an annualized basis for debt with a maturity of 181 to 364 days and 100 basis points on an annualized basis for debt with maturities of 365 days or greater. In conjunction with the program extension in 2009, the FDIC assessed an additional surcharge on debt with a maturity of one year or greater issued after April 1, 2009. Unlike the other TLGP fees, which were reserved for possible TLGP losses and not generally available for DIF purposes, the surcharge was deposited into the DIF and used by the FDIC when calculating the reserve ratio of the Fund. The surcharge varied depending on the type of institution issuing the debt, with IDIs paying the lower fees., 11269=In June 2010, the FDIC remained concerned that, because of the lingering effects of the financial crisis and recession, terminating the TAGP too quickly could lead to liquidity problems for a number of community banks. The Board therefore approved a final rule authorizing another six-month extension, until December 31, 2010, of the TAGP. The FDIC did not increase assessment fees with the second extension, but the final rule reduced the permissible interest rate for the NOW accounts covered by the guarantee to no higher than 0.25 percent in order to better align the program with prevailing market rates. The FDIC provided institutions still participating in the TAGP in the second quarter of 2010 with a one-time opportunity to opt out of the second TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. Almost 6,000 institutions (or 93 percent of those institutions that were participating at the time) remained in the TAGP. The final rule authorizing the second extension also gave the FDIC Board the authority to further extend the TAGP, without further rulemaking, should economic conditions warrant an additional extension, for a period of time not to extend beyond December 31, 2011. However, the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the need for such an extension of the TAGP.}",,"I. Management's Discussion and Analysis The Year in Review The year 2010 was relatively challenging for the FDIC. In addition to the normal course of business, the Corporation continued to resolve failed insured depository institutions (IDIs), increasing resources as needed. The FDIC also started initial steps in the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, continued its work on highprofile policy issues, and published numerous Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRs) throughout the year, seeking comment from the public. The Corporation also continued to focus on a strong supervisory program. The FDIC made enhancements to several versions of the Money Smart education curriculum. The FDIC also sponsored and co-sponsored major conferences and participated in local and global outreach initiatives. Highlighted in this section are the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s 2010 accomplishments in each of its three major business linesÃ¢Â€Â”Insurance, Supervision and Consumer Protection, and Receivership ManagementÃ¢Â€Â”as well as its program support areas. Insurance The FDIC insures bank and savings association deposits. As insurer, the FDIC must continually evaluate and effectively manage how changes in the economy, the financial markets, and the banking system affect the adequacy and the viability of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). State of the Deposit Insurance Fund During 2009 and 2010, losses to the DIF were high. As of December 31, 2010, both the fund balance and the reserve ratio were negative after reserving for probable losses for anticipated bank failures. For the year, assessment revenue and lower-than-anticipated bank failures resulted in an increase in the reserve ratio","Ã‚Â¹ Total base assessment rates do not include the proposed depository institution debt adjustment. Ã‚Â² The unsecured debt adjustment cannot exceed the lesser of 5 basis points or 50 percent of an IDIÃ‚Â’s initial base assessment rate; thus, for example, an IDI with an initial base assessment rate of 5 basis points would have a maximum unsecured debt adjustment of 2.5 basis points and could not have a total base assessment rate lower than 2.5 basis points. Changes to the Large Bank Assessment System The FDIC continued its efforts to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the deposit insurance assessment system by issuing a proposed rule in November 2010, that was finalized in February 2011, and revises the assessment system applicable to large IDIs to better reflect risk at the time a large institution assumes the risk, to better differentiate large institutions during periods of good economic conditions, and to better take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if such an institution fails. The rule eliminates risk categories for large institutions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, under the rule, the FDIC will no longer use long-term debt issuer ratings to calculate assessment rates for large institutions. The rule combines CAMELSÃ‚Â¹ ratings and financial measures into two scorecardsÃ¢Â€Â”one for most large institutions and another for the remaining very large institutions that are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique challenges and risks in case",True,0,0,"{9241=The year 2010 was relatively challenging for the FDIC. In addition to the normal course of business, the Corporation continued to resolve failed insured depository institutions (IDIs), increasing resources as needed. The FDIC also started initial steps in the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, continued its work on highprofile policy issues, and published numerous Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRs) throughout the year, seeking comment from the public. The Corporation also continued to focus on a strong supervisory program. The FDIC made enhancements to several versions of the Money Smart education curriculum. The FDIC also sponsored and co-sponsored major conferences and participated in local and global outreach initiatives., 1252=The new assessment base under the Dodd-Frank Act will be larger than the current assessment base. Applying the current rate schedule to the new assessment base would result in larger total assessments than are currently collected. Accordingly, the rule changing the assessment base also established new rates to take effect in the second quarter of 2011 that will result in collecting approximately the same amount of assessment revenue under the new base as under the current rate schedule using the existing (domestic deposit) base. These schedules also incorporate the changes from the proposed large bank pricing rule that was finalized in February 2011 along with the change in the assessment base. The initial base rates for all institutions will range from 5 to 35 basis points., 7377=As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act revisions, the FDIC developed a comprehensive, long-term management plan for the DIF designed to reduce the pro-cyclicality in the existing system and achieve moderate, steady assessment rates throughout economic and credit cycles while also maintaining a positive fund balance even during a banking crisis, by setting an appropriate target fund size and a strategy for assessment rates and dividends. The FDIC set out the plan in a proposed rulemaking adopted in October 2010. The plan was finalized in rulemakings adopted in December 2010 and February 2011., 5467=Therefore, pursuant to provisions in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that require the FDIC Board to set the DRR for the DIF annually, the FDIC Board proposed in October 2010 to set the 2011 Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) at 2.0 percent of estimated insured deposits. The Board approved a final rule adopting this DRR on December 14, 2010. The FDIC views the 2.0 percent DRR as a long-term goal and the minimum level needed to withstand future crises of the magnitude of past crises. However, the FDICÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis shows that a reserve ratio higher than 2.0 percent would increase the chance that the fund will remain positive during a future economic and banking downturn similar to or more severe than past crises. Thus, the 2.0 percent DRR should not be viewed as a cap on the fund., 3418=The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to define the assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than total domestic deposits (which, with minor adjustments, it has been since 1935). The Act allows the FDIC to modify the assessment base for bankerÃ¢Â€Â™s banks and custodial banks. In November 2010, the FDIC approved a proposed rulemaking that would implement these changes to the assessment base. The FDIC finalized this rulemaking in February 2011., 2887=The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that, for at least five years, the FDIC must make available to the public the reserve ratio and the DRR using both estimated insured deposits and the new assessment base. As of December 31, 2010, the FDIC estimates that the reserve ratio would have been negative 0.06 percent using the new assessment base (as opposed to negative 0.12 percent using estimated insured deposits) and that the 2.0 percent DRR using estimated insured deposits would have been 1.0 percent using the new assessment base., 8484=Highlighted in this section are the CorporationÃ¢Â€Â™s 2010 accomplishments in each of its three major business linesÃ¢Â€Â”Insurance, Supervision and Consumer Protection, and Receivership ManagementÃ¢Â€Â”as well as its program support areas., 310=Changes to the assessment base, assessment rate adjustments, and assessment rates will take effect April 1, 2011. As explained above, the rate schedules will decrease when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15, 2.0, and 2.5 percent., 6746=Pursuant to the comprehensive plan, in October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new Restoration Plan to ensure that the reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. Because of lower expected losses over the next five years than previously anticipated, and the additional time provided by the Dodd-Frank Act to meet the minimum (albeit higher) required reserve ratio, the new Restoration Plan elected to forego the uniform 3 basis point increase in assessment rates scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2011., 7868=During 2009 and 2010, losses to the DIF were high. As of December 31, 2010, both the fund balance and the reserve ratio were negative after reserving for probable losses for anticipated bank failures. For the year, assessment revenue and lower-than-anticipated bank failures resulted in an increase in the reserve ratio to negative 0.12 percent as of December 31, 2010, up from negative 0.39 percent at the beginning of the year., 4576=Once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent, the FDIC believes that assessment rates can be reduced to a moderate level. Therefore, pursuant to its statutory authority to set assessments, in October 2010, the FDIC Board proposed a lower assessment rate schedule to take effect when the fund reserve ratio exceeds 1.15 percent. To increase the probability that the fund reserve ratio will reach a level sufficient to withstand a future crisis, the FDIC also proposed suspending dividends permanently when the fund reserve ratio exceeds 1.5 percent. In lieu of dividends, the FDIC Board proposed to adopt progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the reserve ratio exceeds 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent. These lower assessment rate schedules will serve much the same function as dividends, but will provide more stable and predictable effective assessment rates. The FDIC finalized these long-term assessment rate and dividend changes in February 2011 in concert with the changes to the assessment base and large-bank pricing system described below., 6175=Using historical fund loss and simulated income data from 1950 to the present, the FDIC undertook an analysis to determine how high the reserve ratio would have had to have been before the onset of the two crises that occurred since the late 1980s to have maintained both a positive fund balance and stable assessment rates throughout the period. The analysis concluded that a moderate, long-term average industry assessment rate, combined with an appropriate dividend or assessment rate reduction policy, would have been sufficient to have prevented the fund from becoming negative during the crises, though the fund reserve ratio would have had to exceed 2.0 percent before the onset of the crises.}"

Le due principali conseguenze di ciÃƒÂ² sono: uniformitÃƒÂ : vi sono solo due tipi di intervallo: il tono (sintetizzato dal rapporto 9/8) e il semitono, detto limma (rapporto 256/243, pari a circa 20/19); consonanza degli intervalli di ottava e quinta. Il sistema pitagorico fu adottato nella musica occidentale medievale: esso soddisfaceva le esigenze della composizione monodica e della polifonia medievale, in cui gli accordi conclusivi contenevano solo ottave e quinte. Nel corso del XV secolo si affermÃƒÂ² un uso sempre piÃƒÂ¹ frequente degli intervalli armonici di terza e sesta, che nella scala pitagorica risultano poco consonanti.

ToateÃ‚Â drepturileÃ‚Â rezervate., 35438=Formed: 1991 in Los Angeles, CA, 33485=Freestyle Fellowship's first album is a potent glimpse into the subcultural, conscientious side of Los Angeles hip-hop, one that would later be eclipsed by gangsta boogie from the likes of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and all the pretenders who followed in their wake. As such, the joint Ã¢Â€Â” like much of the work from De La Soul, the Pharcyde, A Tribe Called Quest, and other equally diverse artists of the period Ã¢Â€Â” is a snapshot of a burgeoning art form's purity before it capitulated to the market and rolled out its gripload of Kristal and Bentley worshipers. Not that Freestyle Fellowship ever wandered down that path: they were too busy twisting tongues with blissed-out, stream-of-consciousness rhymes Ã¢Â€Â” which is more or less what you'll find, without the hard-hitting beats, on To Whom It May Concern...

The whole EP tell a story of heart ache, playfulness, purpose, and homelessness. Please Subscribe to my channel is what would happen if Ella Fitzgerald was produced by Dr Dre. Angela Shella's vocals are refreshingly different, avante garde. Angela Shella's ""Good Guys"" fusing different elements of Contemporary Jazz and story telling gospel like Shirley Ceasar. Angela Shella's vocal jazz style is emotional, especially on ""Best Thing I Never Had"" and ""New Man"" both of which are accompanied by piano only. ""New Man"" is a 7 minute rant of emotional vocal jazz and soul vibes, taking a page from Nina Simone. Piano seems to be the common theme through out most of the tunes, with elements of both jazz chords and european classical style. This is simply a brilliant EP. What is refreshing is the title track, Jazz Collection, an instrumental. ""Touch Me"" is the most romantic song. Something you would play when its time to make love, you know, like those Anita Baker love songs. You should buy,",True,1,0,

Share price, yield and investment return fluctuate and an investor's shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Go to the Fund Performance section of this site for standardized total returns and for month-end returns reflecting the fund's current performance. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing. Daily and 30-day yield quotations may reflect current expense absorptions, without which performance would have been lower.

One other thing to remember is that the decimal, double and float are real numbers (ie. 1.5, 1.83, or 3.33) whereas the short, int and long are integers (ie. 75, 600, and -9). You would use an integer as a counter on a 'for' loop, for example; whereas a float would be used for a monetary or interest-rate-calculating app, or anything else that requires fractions. The decimal has more significant figures than the double, therefore it can be more precise- it also takes up slightly more memory. Other than certian math or physics-related algorithms, the double or float should do fine. Sign in to vote 0 Quote |","nice patch....

At the very least, come by to check it out! We have student ambassadors that love school this school as much as I do and are dying to tell you why."", ""Definitely come to campus to check it out, especially if you are in the area. I fell in love with the school when I came here to check it out because at first the idea of a small and secluded school didn't appeal to me, but once I saw for myself the beauty of this place I couldn't resist. They have various overnight programs for accepted students to get to know what the school is about before deciding. Definitely apply, especially since they are pretty generous with waiving application fees, it is worth while to give it a shot. The school is getting more and more well known and it amazes people because we are this tiny Catholic school but we've made it to the 5th place I believe on Forbes magazine of colleges who's graduates make the most money in 10 years. We are up there with Stanford and UC Berkeley. We were also ranked in US News and Weekly as one of the top schools on the West coast and we have numerous famous and successful alumni that love this school so much they are constantly supporting it. This school is truly one of the nation's best educational institutions and we are known for that as well."", ""While the sticker price of the school is around 50,000 like all other private schools, I believe over 80% of the students that attend Saint Mary's have some kind of financial aid, whether academic or need based. There are so many free services here such as free plays, games, activities, clubs, shows, recreational classes, etc, that it is really worth it because everything is paid for. Isn't it nice for the teachers that you are paying so much money for to actually know your name? Also, if money is a concern there are many jobs available on campus as well as outside of the campus in the Walnut Creek area to help pay tuition. In the end all those little nice things, like free planners, weekend of welcome (the first weekend of school for freshman where activities are planned to get everyone familiarized with the school), and the free bbq every wednesday afternoon (community time), really makes it more worth it. Even now, a public UC school costs 30,000 dollars so the gap is no longer as big as it used to be."", ""The campus is beautiful, the buildings on campus is reminiscent of Spanish Missions and there are trees and grass all over campus. The campus certainly has enough room for anything you need, but is compact enough to walk from one side to another in no more than 10 minutes. The weather is pretty nice, it is sunny during the day but it gets cool during the night and morning. These is a feeling of peace on campus that is perfect for an educational institution and really gets you in the mood for learning and being relaxed. They offer many things to the students such as dances and events held by the Campus Activities Board. Some of the things that I've attended is friendship bracelet making night, Salsa lessons, and a pretty big school dance. They offer yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes that are free for students to attend. They also have a counseling center, where you can get a therapist or counselor to talk to for free to manage stress. There are many clubs and organizations that are on campus to be a part of and many of them go on trips to San Francisco, Southern California, and Tahoe during winter."", ""This college is an excellent school if your goal of going to college is for an education. The class sizes are small, about 30 students in my largest class section which is General Chemistry and my smallest class, Seminar, probably has about 15 or so students. For a lot of science major students, the first year of General Chem is the hardest however the professors hear have open office hours and various on campus tutoring centers to help with the subject. Same is available for Math and English courses as well. As a freshman in the Honors/Science living learning community, which is a special dorm that houses the head of the math department as well as honors program, I can literally knock on my neighbor's door, and a math professor is out to help me with my homework even if it is something as trivial and reviewing how to factor polynomials. For students that really want to learn, the Seminar program is excellent as it teaches students the basic historical ideas and literature throughout time that any educated person should know. Also, if you are planning on attending graduate school, the professors and programs here are really designed to hold your hand and help you get a good grade instead of a large school or even worst, a large public school (like a UC) where their main goal is to see who is the last one standing.""]]",Saint Mary's College of California Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Saint-Marys-College-of-California/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/114419,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00240-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903369339,903295559,HORIZONTAL,"{319284=I absolutely love attending SMC!

For a lot of science major students, the first year of General Chem is the hardest however the professors hear have open office hours and various on campus tutoring centers to help with the subject. Same is available for Math and English courses as well.

For students that really want to learn, the Seminar program is excellent as it teaches students the basic historical ideas and literature throughout time that any educated person should know.

It does mean however that 2 religion courses will be required to graduate but they are not difficult and it is a great to be educated about religion as it is plays a huge role in society. Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education.

The class sizes are small, about 30 students in my largest class section which is General Chemistry and my smallest class, Seminar, probably has about 15 or so students. For a lot of science major students, the first year of General Chem is the hardest however the professors hear have open office hours and various on campus tutoring centers to help with the subject. Same is available for Math and English courses as well. As a freshman in the Honors/Science living learning community, which is a special dorm that houses the head of the math department as well as honors program, I can literally knock on my neighbor's door, and a math professor is out to help me with my homework even if it is something as trivial and reviewing how to factor polynomials. For students that really want to learn, the Seminar program is excellent as it teaches students the basic historical ideas and literature throughout time that any educated person should know. Also, if you are planning on attending graduate school, the professors and programs here are really designed to hold your hand and help you get a good grade instead of a large school or even worst, a large public school (like a UC) where their main goal is to see who is",True,0,0,

They have various overnight programs for accepted students to get to know what the school is about before deciding. Definitely apply, especially since they are pretty generous with waiving application fees, it is worth while to give it a shot. The school is getting more and more well known and it amazes people because we are this tiny Catholic school but we've made it to the 5th place I believe on Forbes magazine of colleges who's graduates make the most money in 10 years. We are up there with Stanford and UC Berkeley. We were also ranked in US News and Weekly as one of the top schools on the West coast and we have numerous famous and successful alumni that love this school so much they are constantly supporting it.

We have people of all backgrounds, races, gender, sexuality, religious beliefs here on campus and everyone is treated equally and with respect. Just because it is a Catholic school does not mean you must be Catholic or even religious to attend. It does mean however that 2 religion courses will be required to graduate but they are not difficult and it is a great to be educated about religion as it is plays a huge role in society. Even if you don't believe in it, it is good to know what people mean when they say the forbidden fruit or know who Moses is, it should be considered general education. Students that are looking for a quite environment rich with opportunities to be involved in the community while getting a top notch education should strongly consider what Saint Mary's has to offer.

The campus certainly has enough room for anything you need, but is compact enough to walk from one side to another in no more than 10 minutes. The weather is pretty nice, it is sunny during the day but it gets cool during the night and morning. These is a feeling of peace on campus that is perfect for an educational institution and really gets you in the mood for learning and being relaxed. They offer many things to the students such as dances and events held by the Campus Activities Board. Some of the things that I've attended is friendship bracelet making night, Salsa lessons, and a pretty big school dance. They offer yoga, pilates, and other fitness classes that are free for students to attend. They also have a counseling center, where you can get a therapist or counselor to talk to for free to manage stress. There are many clubs and organizations that are on campus to be a part of and many of them go on trips to San Francisco, Southern California, and Tahoe during winter.

The EcoAqua EFF-6009A and Supco WF286 are aftermarket replacements that offer a 400 gallon capacity and pressure range of 30-120 PSI. The Swift Green SGF-W41 is also an aftermarket filter, but it only offers a 300 gallon capacity and 20-100 PSI pressure range.

When finalized, these proposed standards would increase the level of environmental protection., 200142=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the receipt of a complete petition requesting that the EPA add the chemical n-Propyl Bromide (nPB) (Chemical Abstract Service No. 106-94-5) to the list of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) contained in section 112(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). On October 28, 2010 and November 28, 2012, the Halogenated Solvent Industry Alliance (HSIA) submitted a petition to list nPB as a HAP and a supplement to the petition, respectively. In addition, on November 24, 2011, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitted a petition to add nPB to the HAP list. We have determined that these petitions are complete for purposes of this process, which means they provide sufficient information to assess the human health impacts on people living in the vicinity of facilities emitting nPB. Today's document initiates our comprehensive technical review phase of the petition process. The EPA invites the public to comment on these petitions and to provide additional data, beyond what are in these petitions, on sources, emissions, exposure, health effects and environmental impacts associated with nPB that may be relevant to our technical review. These petitions and supporting information are available through Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0471.

The direct final rule was published without prior proposal because EPA anticipated no adverse comments. EPA stated in the direct final rule that if EPA received relevant, adverse comments by March 26, 2015, EPA would publish a timely withdrawal in the Federal Register . EPA received a relevant, adverse comment on March 25, 2015, and accordingly is withdrawing the direct final rule, and in a separate subsequent final rulemaking will address the comment received., 70033=The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has submitted updated regulations for receiving delegation of EPA authority for implementation and enforcement of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 sources). These regulations apply to certain NESHAPs promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 63, as amended between April 13, 2004 and April 24, 2013. The delegation of authority under this action does not apply to sources located in Indian Country. EPA is taking direct final action to approve the delegation of certain NESHAPs to TCEQ., 194662=On August 5, 2014, The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) requested an Alternative Means of Emission Limitation (AMEL) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) in order to operate pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its Propane Dehydrogenation Plant and its Light Hydrocarbons Plant at its Texas Operations site located in Freeport, Texas. On October 21, 2014, ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil) requested an AMEL under the CAA for its pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares at its' Olefins Plant in Baytown, Texas, and its' Plastics Plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. In this document, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting comment on all aspects of the AMEL requests and the resulting alternative operating conditions that are necessary to achieve a reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions required by various standards in 40 CFR parts 60, 61 and 63 that apply to emission sources controlled by these pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares. These standards point to the operating requirements for flares in the General Provisions to parts 60 and 63, respectively, to comply with the emission reduction requirements. Because pressure-assisted multi-point ground flares cannot meet the velocity requirements in these General Provisions, Dow and ExxonMobil are seeking an AMEL., 188638=The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to correct and clarify certain text of the final action titled Ã¢Â€ÂœNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units,Ã¢Â€? which was published in the Federal Register of Thursday, February 16, 2012. We are also proposing to remove rule provisions establishing an affirmative defense for malfunction events in light of a recent court decision on the issue., 349460=This action supplements our proposed amendments to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the Ferroalloys Production source category published in the Federal Register on November 23, 2011. In that action, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed amendments based on the initial technology and residual risk reviews for this source category. Today's action presents a revised technology review and a revised residual risk review for the Ferroalloys Production source category and proposes revisions to the standards based on those reviews. This action also proposes new compliance requirements to meet the revised standards. This action would result in significant environmental improvements through the reduction of fugitive manganese emissions and through more stringent emission limits for several processes.}","Thu, 04 Jun 2015 20:18:20 GMT","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 31470 - Completion of Requirement To Promulgate Emissions Standards 2015-06-03; vol. 80 # 106 - Wednesday, June 3, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

The following table illustrates the issue. Pedestrian friendly development closer to where people work also can keep cars off the roads. The Amp, a full BRT to run from West Nashville to the Five Points are of East Nashville, also is in the works. City officials say it is needed to ease current and future congestion, although some critics say it will not make things worse along West End Avenue. Transportation planners and city officials say the region will not be able to cope with its long-term growth without mass transit. Already, the Metro Transit Authority has added bus rapid transit lite, a type of express bus, to key corridors on Gallatin Pike and Murfreesboro Pike. Ã‚Â“It frankly would probably be a waste of everyoneÃ‚Â’s money,Ã‚Â” Skipper added. Adding lanes also is always an option, but Knauf said that can prove expensive and there isnÃ‚Â’t always room. Ã‚Â“This is only new technology to our area,Ã‚Â” Skipper said. Ã‚Â“It has proven successful.Ã‚Â” Rather than just re-timing lights every few years, computers change the intervals on the fly based current traffic conditions. Mt. Juliet will be the first city in the region to adopt it under a $653,000 program. Likewise, a system called adaptive signal technology takes syncing lights to the next level.","Metro has rezoned parts of midtown to foster denser development. Skipper says the market will ultimately make that happen over time. He said local governments can help by providing the needed public improvements, such as roads and sidewalks. Ã‚Â“The public sector push to provide that infrastructure is our way to enable that to actually happen,Ã‚Â” Skipper said. Reader reaction The public has strong opinions on the traffic issue. The Tennessean recently asked readers on Facebook to weigh in on the areas they consider bad and what should be done to help make the situation better. Here are some highlights: Ã‚Â• Ã‚Â“We need better public transit to cut down on car commutes!!!Ã‚Â” Al Roberson said. Ã‚Â• Ã‚Â“At least Nashville has a decent freeway network,Ã‚Â” Kye Logan Miller said. Ã‚Â“You should see Memorial/Old Fort/Broad in Murfreesboro at 5 pm.Ã‚Â” Ã‚Â• Ã‚Â“Real public transportation is desperately needed. Roads can only be reasonably widened so far,Ã‚Â” Josh Hedge posted. Ã‚Â• Ã‚Â“Synchronized red lights would make a difference especially on Charlotte Pike from 7th Avenue to 28th. It is ridiculous to get a green light at one intersection only to stop at the next red light and then the next and the next because the lights are out of synch,Ã‚Â” Susan Lowe posted. Ã‚Â• Ã‚Â“More, quality public transit. Make the Music City Star an actual star instead of a line,Ã‚Â” Matt Davis wrote. Ã‚Â“I'm from the Tampa Bay area. We have bad traffic in our area.

The play, Shiva\'s Dance, is an attempt to understand--from within, as it were--varous individuals\' encounters with the miraculous. I understand the miraculous to mean that which is inexplicable in any rational or past-experiential sense. My play is set in Sri Lanka, near the village of Kataragama where the annual firewalking ceremonies take place even today. Firewalking is the central ""miracle"" of the play, but it symbolically represents much more: It is an intiation of consciousness and only those who are ready for the sacred experience of silent awareness can succeed at it. There are various representatives of Western Culture present in Sri Lanka for various reasons in my play. There is a Protestant Christian missionary and his frustrated wife. There is an agricultural technologist who is the voice of reason and science. And there is a CUSO teacher: she grows into the focal point of the play and she discovers her own resources in the face of terror. Yes, terror: The play is set in Sri Lanka, so other difficulties arise from these circumstances. The Sri Lankan civil war comes to the corner where these individuals are working out their destinies and terrorists play a role in the events\' unfolding. Furthermore, there is the ""old"" versus the ""new"" conflict between two other characters--a father and a son--who are Sr i Lankan. And, lastly, at the most obvious level, the play involves us in questions of cross-cultural education and/or indoctrination. It forces each of us (I hope) to question the cultural imperatives which we take for granted and to realize that these imperatives must be deconstructed to awaken to new self-created potentials. Because Shiva\'s Dance was written in isolation, I naturally had to deal with the impact of its unveiling to other minds. I write about this in my Introduction in a general way, and in a longer Appendix in a more personal manner. In these parts, I attempt to study the process of creating characters who sometimes act against the writer\'S intentions and with the writer\'S assumed need to prevent this. I also deal openly with the process of continual rewrites and dealings with friendly critics and my review committee.', 'en_US', 'Lethbridge, Alta. : University of Lethbridge, Faculty of Education, 1990', 'Project (University of Lethbridge.
