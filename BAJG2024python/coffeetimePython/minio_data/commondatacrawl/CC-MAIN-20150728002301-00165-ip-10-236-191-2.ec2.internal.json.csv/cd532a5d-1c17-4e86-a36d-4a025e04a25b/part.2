Table 1 Data were weighted to represent the national population of physicians in the Medical Marketing Service database who spend 20 or more hours per week on direct patient care, using the Medical Marketing Service variables mentioned above. As can be seen in Analysis Data collection was undertaken between November 2000 and February 2001. The questionnaire was mailed to the selected physicians with a check for US $35 as a token of appreciation for completing the questionnaire. Up to 3 reminders were sent and additional telephone contact made with nonresponders. Of the original 2000 physicians sent the survey, 38 were ineligible because they were deceased, retired, or no longer in practice; and 1050 physicians completed the questionnaire (response rate 53%). Of these, 515 received the Internet version of the questionnaire, and 535 the direct-to-consumer advertising version. Response Rate ]. Part 3 was received by the entire sample and obtained demographic and workload information: hours per week on face-to-face consultations, on other tasks related to patient care, and on administrative tasks; numbers of patients seen per week; practice income; proportions of patients on Medicaid, from minority groups, having household incomes of less than $20000 per annum, and without health insurance; geographic setting of practice; age and racial origin of respondent.

All the demographic, workload, and practice variables listed in Table 1 were run against each of these 4 outcome variables. Univariate relationships were calculated using the chi-square statistic or Fisher exact test as appropriate. In addition, univariate relationships were also investigated for an intermediate outcome: whether or not the physician did what the patient requested (yes completely vs yes partially vs no), a variable which in turn is evaluated for its relationship",True,0,-1,"{8981=Cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of United States physicians (1050 respondents; response rate 53%)., 8765=Eighty-five percent of respondents had experienced a patient bringing Internet information to a visit. The quality of information was important: accurate, relevant information benefited, while inaccurate or irrelevant information harmed health care, health outcomes, and the physician-patient relationship. However, the physician's feeling that the patient was challenging his or her authority was the most consistent predictor of a perceived deterioration in the physician-patient relationship (OR = 14.9; 95% CI, 5.5-40.5), in the quality of health care (OR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.9), or health outcomes (OR = 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-18.7). Thirty-eight percent of physicians believed that the patient bringing in information made the visit less time efficient, particularly if the patient wanted something inappropriate (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.4), or the physician felt challenged (OR = 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.2)., 1162=Data collection was undertaken between November 2000 and February 2001.

(For Language Log Classic, the old series, see this page.) Here's a tip for eager readers: don't print off my posts or quote them verbatim or quibble with them on your blog or email them to friends until they've been up for at least a day or two. I often edit, embellish, or expand what I post. Eventually I leave things alone to face the judgment of cyberhistory, but I never quite know what I've said or how it looks until I see it up on the site, so I frequently tinker, tamper, dicker, fiddle, or mess with what I've written during the first 36 hours or so. Wait awhile and reload before quoting, if you can bear the suspense. Ã¢Â€Â”GKP Geoffrey K. Pullum: Posts on Language Log (newest at the top)",,True,1,0,,,"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 08:47:29 GMT"

The longer the checksum, the harder it is to change the data and recreate the same checksum. Also, some checksums have known flaws. The following table summarizes the cryptographic checksums: //--> document.write('');","The order in the above chart is intentional. When it comes to cryptographic checksums, MD4 is the least secure, and SHA-1 is the most secure. Always choose the most secure checksum available in your cryptosystem. Another term to look for in a cryptographic checksum is HMAC or Hash-based Message Authentication Code. This indicates that the checksum algorithm uses a key as part of the checksum. This is good, as it's impossible to alter the checksum without access to the key. If a cryptographic checksum uses HMAC, you'll see that term before the name of the checksum. For example, HMAC-MD4 is more secure than MD4, HMAC-SHA is more secure than SHA. If we were to order the checksum algorithms from least secure to most secure, it would look like this: MD4 MD5 SHA SHA-1 HMAC-MD4 HMAC-MD5 HMAC-SHA HMAC-SHA-1 Authenticity So far, we've ensured that the data has been encrypted and that the data hasn't been altered during transit. However, all of that work would be for naught if the data, and more importantly, the key, were mistakenly sent to the wrong recipient. This is where the third component, or authenticity, comes into play. Before any encryption can occur, a key has to be created and exchanged.

The possible Diffie Hellman bit sizes have been divided into groups. The following chart summarizes the possible Diffie Hellman Groups: It is important to realize that Diffie Hellman doesn't make the actual session key itself, but the keying information used to generate that key. This involves a fair bit of fancy math which isn't for the faint of heart. The best explanation I've come across, in understandable language with diagrams, is Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange - A Non-Mathematician's Explanation by Keith Palmgren. Authenticating the recipient is one half of the authenticity component. The other half involves generating and exchanging the information that will be used to create the session key which in turn will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This again requires an asymmetric algorithm, but this time it is usually the Diffie Hellman, or DH, algorithm. There is one last point to make on the subject of digital certificates and CAs. A digital certificate contains an expiration date, and the certificate cannot be deleted from the CA before that date. What if a private key becomes compromised before that date? You'll obviously want to generate a new certificate containing the new public key. However, you can't delete the old certificate until it expires. To ensure that certificate won't inadvertently be used to authenticate a recipient, you","When configuring a cryptosytem, you should use the largest Diffie Hellman Group size that it supports. The other term you'll see associated with the keying information is PFS, or Perfect Forward Secrecy, which Diffie Hellman supports. PFS ensures that the new keying information is not mathematically related to the old keying information. This means that if someone sniffs an old session key, they won't be able to use that key to guess the new session key. PFS is always a good thing and you should use it if the cryptosytem supports it. Putting It All Together Let's do a quick recap and summarize how a cryptosytem protects the data transmitted onto a network. First, the recipient's public key is used to verify that you are sending the data to the correct recipient. That public key was created by the RSA algorithm and is typically stored in a digital certificate that resides on a CA. Once the recipient is verified, the DH algorithm is used to create the information that will be used to create the session key. Once the keying information is available, a key that is unique to that session is created. This key is used by both the sender and the receiver to encrypt and decrypt the data they send to each other. It is important that this key changes often. Before the data is encrypted, a cryptographic checksum is calculated. Once the data is decrypted, the cryptographic",False,-1,0,,"{18746=The most common key generation algorithm is RSA.

Also, if you know any in particular where the male lead is hot and cool, and one of the two (or both) has a mysterious past, that would be a bonus.

NMEA 0183 is a standard protocol, used by GPS receivers to transmit data. NMEA 183 sentences are all American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). Each sentence begins with dollar sign ($) and the next five characters determine the sentence type. The Ã¢Â€Âœ$GPRMCÃ¢Â€? sentence type is the most important and useful format and includes positional and temporal data. For this reason, this sentence type was used in the study. The GPS receiver sends data every second to the software. Ã¢Â€Âœ$GPRMCÃ¢Â€? sentence fields are separated with commas. In the first step the sentence is stored in an array variable by the software; in the second step sentence fields are split by a Split command in the software and in the third step sentence fields are stored to the SQL Server 2005 database.}",

Ethiopia is endowed with abundant water resources distributed in many parts of the country however, it has not made significant progress in the field of water resources development during the past four decades. In particular, the exploitation of hydropower potentials was not noticeably successful in spite of being given priority as a major field of national development Considering the substantial hydroÃ¯Â¿Â½power resources, Ethiopia has one of the lowest levels of per capita electrical consumption in the world. Out of hydropower potential of about 15,000-30,000 MW, only about 360 MW (i.e. less than 2 percent) has been exploited by 1997 (Table 1). The total production of the above mentioned hydropower plants is 1,469.0 GWh/yr. (1994-1995).Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Table 1. Hydropower Plants and Installed Capacity 1.

The use of these fuels has resulted in massive deforestation and soil erosion. The population of Ethiopia was estimated in 1995 at 57 million and is thought to be growing at an annual rate of about 3.1%. In recent years, since the country has merged from the drought and civil war of the 1980Ã‚Â’s and since the implementation of a comprehensive program of economic reform, the economy has recuperated and is now growing. Such economic growth is essential to lift the people from severe poverty but can only be sustained by adequate infrastructures and in particular adequate supplies of electrical energy. The expected continued economic growth (in an environment of power shortage that had recently resulted in rationing) coupled with the rapid expansion of the transmission grid, will increase the number of consumers and thus the total energy demand in the next few years. This condition should evidently lead to an energy development program for accelerating the development process notably in the undertaking of studies and preparation of detailed engineering designs of hydropower projects that could be implemented within the shortest possible time.

The most recent water chemistry of the lake was completed in the deepest part of the east basin in August of 1989. Dissolved oxygen levels were 5 ppm or better to a depth of 24 feet. Water temperatures ranged from 73Ã‚Â° at the surface to 49Ã‚Â° near the bottom. A 1968 water chemistry survey showed dissolved oxygen levels above 5 ppm at least 25-30 feet in three major bays of the lake, with water temperatures between 17-20Ã‚Â°C. In 1989 total alkalinity ranged form 110-147 ppm, indicating fair buffering capacity. In 1968 average total alkalinity ranged from 120-135 ppm. The pH ranged from 8.2 to 8.8 in 1985, and in 1968 it ranged from 6.5 to 8.0 ppm.

Because of the difficulty of accurately aging esocids from scales, only two surveys included analysis of growth. In 1983 growth was much above average, and in 1989 the few muskies collected were growing below state average rates., 102416=1928, 72911=1972, 62190=1985, 105821=1924, 20608=Table 1.-Species and relative abundance of fishes collected by number and weight in Gun Lake, 1989 (all gear)., 81576=1959, 85568=1953, 66194=1979, 6412=The composition of the fish population is essentially the same today as it has been since the 1940s (Table 1). Earlier seine surveys took a variety of forage species including blacknose, mimic, sand, spottail, emerald, spotfin, and golden shiners, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, banded killifish, logperch, johnny darter, brook silversides, and northern creek chub. The abundance of several game species has fluctuated over past decades and has dictated the management practices on the lake. According to angler reports, northern pike were apparently abundant in the 1930s and 1940s, then declined for some unknown reason. A 1950 survey showed modest numbers of pike, but low numbers were seen in subsequent years until the most recent surveys in the 1980s. Musky numbers were historically sufficient to support a winter spear fishery, but no summer fishery ever developed. Few muskies were collected in surveys until plants for broodstock were initiated in the mid-1970s. Existing walleye populations were augmented by fry plants in the 1920s, but apparently sufficient numbers were already present to create at least a modest fishery. Fair numbers of walleyes were collected in surveys since the 1950s, even in years when no walleyes were stocked., 103753=1926, 73576=1971, 12374=The yellow perch population does not appear to have changed significantly from the populations surveyed in the early 1950s and 1960s. Maximum size of perch in survey collections was between 10 and 12 inches, with the exception of a subsample collected during musky broodstock netting in 1985, when the largest perch sampled was 8.4 inches. The average size of perch ranged from 4.7 to 8.3 inches. These averages are of course greatly influenced by gear type; the two surveys with the lowest average size of perch (1989 and 1983) were those where 2 to 5 inch perch collected while electroshocking made up the majority of the perch sampled. The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in surveys has fluctuated from year to year, and was higher in 1989 than in previous years. Many local anglers are convinced that the average size of perch declined after musky stocking for broodstock was initiated in 1977, and that fewer large perch have been caught in recent years. We have no census data to verify these claims. There is no evidence of a significant change in the average or maximum size of perch collected in surveys, either before or after the initiation of stocking either muskies or walleyes. Growth has been above average in all surveys with available growth data, except the 1984 sample, where the -0.5 growth index is still considered ""normal"". This was also a smaller sample of perch than in all other surveys., 72246=1973, 92996=1942, 90967=1945, 62857=1984, 60856=1987, 9994=Walleyes have been the target in surveys more than any other species in Gun Lake. The average size of fish in collections since 1961 ranged from 8.3 to 20.8 inches, and individuals up to 27 inches and 7 pounds have been taken. Despite the frequency of surveys, walleye growth was not evaluated regularly, but the few analyses done show growth to be much above average in Gun Lake., 104447=1925, 1858=The Gun Lake watershed encompasses 30 square miles and is in the Kalamazoo River Basin, draining into Lake Michigan. It has 17.8 miles of shoreline, with 1.4 miles more shoreline in islands. The lake has eight inlets, including those from Payne, Long Hall, and Fawn lakes. The Hall Lake inlet feeds three walleye rearing ponds on the east shore of the lake. The outlet of Gun Lake is the Gun River, a designated trout stream for most of its length. The lake level is controlled by a dam in the outlet just above Patterson Road, which was built in 1905. Land use in the watershed is predominantly agriculture, though a large percentage of the land is included in the Barry State Game Area and Yankee Springs Recreation Area and remains in its natural wooded state., 61523=1986, 103084=1927, 100407=1931, 109869=1921, 68195=1976, 82241=1958, 20030=Inskip, P. D. 1986. Negative associations between abundances of muskellunge and northern pike: evidence and possible explanations. American Fishery Society Special Publication 15:135-150., 13809=Bluegills have averaged between 4.8 and 6.9 inches in surveys, and individuals up to 10 inches have been collected. In 1989, over 56% of the bluegills were 6 inches or larger. Growth is slightly below average in all but the oldest surveys. Black crappies averaged between 5.6 and 10.1 inches, and individuals up to 13 inches have been collected. Over 92% of the sample collected in 1989 were over 7 inches. Growth has been at state average rates in recent years. These species, along with rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish, should produce a good panfish fishery in the lake. However, Gun Lake is not noted as one of the better panfish lakes in the District, since several nearby lakes are capable of producing 8 and 9 inch bluegills rather consistently., 89614=1947, 19853=Dombeck, M. P., B. W. Menzel, and P. N. Hinz. 1986. Natural muskellunge reproduction in midwestern lakes. American Fishery Society Special Publication 15:122-134., 99069=1933, 10389=The northern musky population in the lake has been reduced to a fraction of what existed prior to cessation of stocking in 1983. While Great Lakes muskies were native to the lake, it is doubtful that natural reproduction could maintain a musky population today, given the extensive development of the lake. Cultural development is cited as a primary reason for the decline of native musky populations in many northern states (Dombeck et al. 1986). Competition with northern pike is another crucial factor in the success of muskies when the two coexist in a lake. Pike are known to utilize similar forage to the musky, and are predators on young-of-the-year muskies (Dombeck et al. 1986; Inskip 1986). Walleye would also compete with muskies for forage at some sizes, and could prey on young-of-the-year muskies., 99738=1932, 106511=1923, 5899=Early records indicate there were native populations of both muskellunge and walleye in Gun Lake. The lake mapping crew in 1945 noted they had seen pictures of record catches of walleyes, pike, bass, and muskellunge. Species they reported seeing in anglers' creels were perch, bluegills, pike, muskies, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and sunfish. Walleyes (yellow pike-perch) were first reported in gill-net and seine surveys in 1950 and were stocked in the lake as early as 1921 (see Appendix 1)., 59522=1989, 63524=1983, 79561=1962, 97036=1936, 69545=1975, 95004=1939, 11603=Northern pike numbers have increased in the lake in recent years, and a good fishery exists for them today. Small areas of suitable habitat still exist on the lake for the population to maintain itself, and a large marshy area at the Payne Lake inlet is available for spawning. Anglers interested in large sports fish have apparently turned to pike and walleyes following the decline in the musky population. Conservation Officer reports and local fishing reports support this change, but no creel census data exists from recent years. The average size of pike collected in surveys ranged from 16.6 to 24.8 inches, and individuals up to 41 inches were collected. Growth in pike aged in 1989 was slow, with fish growing 0.7 inches below state average rates., 77566=1965, 58137=Appendix 1.--Gun Lake stocking summary, 1921 to present., 86237=1952, 66862=1978, 88946=1948, 76901=1966, 108=Michigan Department of Natural Resources Status of the Fishery Resource Report 91-2, 1991, 92326=1943, 97729=1935, 16097=Presently, Gun Lake is stocked annually with walleye fingerlings.

Existing walleye populations were augmented by fry plants in the 1920s, but apparently sufficient numbers were already present to create at least a modest fishery. Fair numbers of walleyes were collected in surveys since the 1950s, even in years when no walleyes were stocked., 103753=1926, 73576=1971, 12374=The yellow perch population does not appear to have changed significantly from the populations surveyed in the early 1950s and 1960s. Maximum size of perch in survey collections was between 10 and 12 inches, with the exception of a subsample collected during musky broodstock netting in 1985, when the largest perch sampled was 8.4 inches. The average size of perch ranged from 4.7 to 8.3 inches. These averages are of course greatly influenced by gear type; the two surveys with the lowest average size of perch (1989 and 1983) were those where 2 to 5 inch perch collected while electroshocking made up the majority of the perch sampled. The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in surveys has fluctuated from year to year, and was higher in 1989 than in previous years. Many local anglers are convinced that the average size of perch declined after musky stocking for broodstock was initiated in 1977, and that fewer large perch have been caught in recent years. We have no census data to verify these claims. There is no evidence of a significant change in the average or maximum size of perch collected in surveys, either before or after the initiation of stocking either muskies or walleyes. Growth has been above average in all surveys with available growth data, except the 1984 sample, where the -0.5 growth index is still considered ""normal"". This was also a smaller sample of perch than in all other surveys., 72246=1973, 92996=1942, 90967=1945, 62857=1984, 60856=1987, 9994=Walleyes have been the target in surveys more than any other species in Gun Lake. The average size of fish in collections since 1961 ranged from 8.3 to 20.8 inches, and individuals up to 27 inches and 7 pounds have been taken. Despite the frequency of surveys, walleye growth was not evaluated regularly, but the few analyses done show growth to be much above average in Gun Lake., 104447=1925, 1858=The Gun Lake watershed encompasses 30 square miles and is in the Kalamazoo River Basin, draining into Lake Michigan. It has 17.8 miles of shoreline, with 1.4 miles more shoreline in islands. The lake has eight inlets, including those from Payne, Long Hall, and Fawn lakes. The Hall Lake inlet feeds three walleye rearing ponds on the east shore of the lake. The outlet of Gun Lake is the Gun River, a designated trout stream for most of its length. The lake level is controlled by a dam in the outlet just above Patterson Road, which was built in 1905. Land use in the watershed is predominantly agriculture, though a large percentage of the land is included in the Barry State Game Area and Yankee Springs Recreation Area and remains in its natural wooded state., 61523=1986, 103084=1927, 100407=1931, 109869=1921, 68195=1976, 82241=1958, 20030=Inskip, P. D. 1986. Negative associations between abundances of muskellunge and northern pike: evidence and possible explanations. American Fishery Society Special Publication 15:135-150., 13809=Bluegills have averaged between 4.8 and 6.9 inches in surveys, and individuals up to 10 inches have been collected. In 1989, over 56% of the bluegills were 6 inches or larger. Growth is slightly below average in all but the oldest surveys. Black crappies averaged between 5.6 and 10.1 inches, and individuals up to 13 inches have been collected. Over 92% of the sample collected in 1989 were over 7 inches. Growth has been at state average rates in recent years. These species, along with rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish, should produce a good panfish fishery in the lake. However, Gun Lake is not noted as one of the better panfish lakes in the District, since several nearby lakes are capable of producing 8 and 9 inch bluegills rather consistently., 89614=1947, 19853=Dombeck, M. P., B. W. Menzel, and P. N. Hinz. 1986. Natural muskellunge reproduction in midwestern lakes. American Fishery Society Special Publication 15:122-134., 99069=1933, 10389=The northern musky population in the lake has been reduced to a fraction of what existed prior to cessation of stocking in 1983. While Great Lakes muskies were native to the lake, it is doubtful that natural reproduction could maintain a musky population today, given the extensive development of the lake. Cultural development is cited as a primary reason for the decline of native musky populations in many northern states (Dombeck et al. 1986). Competition with northern pike is another crucial factor in the success of muskies when the two coexist in a lake. Pike are known to utilize similar forage to the musky, and are predators on young-of-the-year muskies (Dombeck et al. 1986; Inskip 1986). Walleye would also compete with muskies for forage at some sizes, and could prey on young-of-the-year muskies., 99738=1932, 106511=1923, 5899=Early records indicate there were native populations of both muskellunge and walleye in Gun Lake. The lake mapping crew in 1945 noted they had seen pictures of record catches of walleyes, pike, bass, and muskellunge. Species they reported seeing in anglers' creels were perch, bluegills, pike, muskies, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and sunfish. Walleyes (yellow pike-perch) were first reported in gill-net and seine surveys in 1950 and were stocked in the lake as early as 1921 (see Appendix 1)., 59522=1989, 63524=1983, 79561=1962, 97036=1936, 69545=1975, 95004=1939, 11603=Northern pike numbers have increased in the lake in recent years, and a good fishery exists for them today. Small areas of suitable habitat still exist on the lake for the population to maintain itself, and a large marshy area at the Payne Lake inlet is available for spawning. Anglers interested in large sports fish have apparently turned to pike and walleyes following the decline in the musky population. Conservation Officer reports and local fishing reports support this change, but no creel census data exists from recent years. The average size of pike collected in surveys ranged from 16.6 to 24.8 inches, and individuals up to 41 inches were collected. Growth in pike aged in 1989 was slow, with fish growing 0.7 inches below state average rates., 77566=1965, 58137=Appendix 1.--Gun Lake stocking summary, 1921 to present., 86237=1952, 66862=1978, 88946=1948, 76901=1966, 108=Michigan Department of Natural Resources Status of the Fishery Resource Report 91-2, 1991, 92326=1943, 97729=1935, 16097=Presently, Gun Lake is stocked annually with walleye fingerlings. Musky stocking was suspended in 1984, and has not resumed. The broodstock designation for the lake was lifted in 1985, and spearing is again allowed on the lake. The last collection of broodstock for muskies was in 1985. At that time, 115 pike and 47 muskies were taken, as well as 39 walleyes. Good habitat exists for walleye growth and reproduction, and the addition of additional spawning habitat has been considered.

Growth is somewhat slow, but generally has been within acceptable ranges in all surveys. In 1989, 17% of the largemouth collected were legal size or larger, and individuals up to 4.6 pounds were collected. Smallmouth bass have averaged between 5.9 and 10.8 inches in surveys, and individuals up to 20 inches have been taken. Growth is slow in smallmouths; in all surveys where growth was evaluated, the fish averaged at least 1.0 inches below state average rates. Despite slow growth rates, many smallmouths reach sizes acceptable to anglers.

There is a sewage treatment plant serving all the residences and businesses around the lake, the Gun Lake Sewer Authority, that was built in 1980. The most recent water chemistry of the lake was completed in the deepest part of the east basin in August of 1989. Dissolved oxygen levels were 5 ppm or better to a depth of 24 feet. Water temperatures ranged from 73Ã‚Â° at the surface to 49Ã‚Â° near the bottom. A 1968 water chemistry survey showed dissolved oxygen levels above 5 ppm at least 25-30 feet in three major bays of the lake, with water temperatures between 17-20Ã‚Â°C. In 1989 total alkalinity ranged form 110-147 ppm, indicating fair buffering capacity. In 1968 average total alkalinity ranged from 120-135 ppm. The pH ranged from 8.2 to 8.8 in 1985, and in 1968 it ranged from 6.5 to 8.0 ppm.

Earlier seine surveys took a variety of forage species including blacknose, mimic, sand, spottail, emerald, spotfin, and golden shiners, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, banded killifish, logperch, johnny darter, brook silversides, and northern creek chub. The abundance of several game species has fluctuated over past decades and has dictated the management practices on the lake. According to angler reports, northern pike were apparently abundant in the 1930s and 1940s, then declined for some unknown reason. A 1950 survey showed modest numbers of pike, but low numbers were seen in subsequent years until the most recent surveys in the 1980s. Musky numbers were historically sufficient to support a winter spear fishery, but no summer fishery ever developed. Few muskies were collected in surveys until plants for broodstock were initiated in the mid-1970s. Existing walleye populations were augmented by fry plants in the 1920s, but apparently sufficient numbers were already present to create at least a modest fishery. Fair numbers of walleyes were collected in surveys since the 1950s, even in years when no walleyes were stocked., 103753=1926, 73576=1971, 12374=The yellow perch population does not appear to have changed significantly from the populations surveyed in the early 1950s and 1960s. Maximum size of perch in survey collections was between 10 and 12 inches, with the exception of a subsample collected during musky broodstock netting in 1985, when the largest perch sampled was 8.4 inches.

Many local anglers are convinced that the average size of perch declined after musky stocking for broodstock was initiated in 1977, and that fewer large perch have been caught in recent years. We have no census data to verify these claims. There is no evidence of a significant change in the average or maximum size of perch collected in surveys, either before or after the initiation of stocking either muskies or walleyes. Growth has been above average in all surveys with available growth data, except the 1984 sample, where the -0.5 growth index is still considered ""normal"".

Black crappies averaged between 5.6 and 10.1 inches, and individuals up to 13 inches have been collected. Over 92% of the sample collected in 1989 were over 7 inches. Growth has been at state average rates in recent years. These species, along with rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish, should produce a good panfish fishery in the lake. However, Gun Lake is not noted as one of the better panfish lakes in the District, since several nearby lakes are capable of producing 8 and 9 inch bluegills rather consistently., 89614=1947, 19853=Dombeck, M. P., B. W. Menzel, and P. N. Hinz. 1986. Natural muskellunge reproduction in midwestern lakes. American Fishery Society Special Publication 15:122-134., 99069=1933, 10389=The northern musky population in the lake has been reduced to a fraction of what existed prior to cessation of stocking in 1983. While Great Lakes muskies were native to the lake, it is doubtful that natural reproduction could maintain a musky population today, given the extensive development of the lake. Cultural development is cited as a primary reason for the decline of native musky populations in many northern states (Dombeck et al. 1986). Competition with northern pike is another crucial factor in the success of muskies when the two coexist in a lake. Pike are known to utilize similar forage to the musky, and are predators on young-of-the-year muskies (Dombeck et al. 1986; Inskip 1986). Walleye would also compete with muskies for forage at some sizes, and could prey on young-of-the-year muskies., 99738=1932, 106511=1923, 5899=Early records indicate there were native populations of both muskellunge and walleye in Gun Lake. The lake mapping crew in 1945 noted they had seen pictures of record catches of walleyes, pike, bass, and muskellunge. Species they reported seeing in anglers' creels were perch, bluegills, pike, muskies, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and sunfish. Walleyes (yellow pike-perch) were first reported in gill-net and seine surveys in 1950 and were stocked in the lake as early as 1921 (see Appendix 1)., 59522=1989, 63524=1983, 79561=1962, 97036=1936, 69545=1975, 95004=1939, 11603=Northern pike numbers have increased in the lake in recent years, and a good fishery exists for them today. Small areas of suitable habitat still exist on the lake for the population to maintain itself, and a large marshy area at the Payne Lake inlet is available for spawning. Anglers interested in large sports fish have apparently turned to pike and walleyes following the decline in the musky population. Conservation Officer reports and local fishing reports support this change, but no creel census data exists from recent years. The average size of pike collected in surveys ranged from 16.6 to 24.8 inches, and individuals up to 41 inches were collected. Growth in pike aged in 1989 was slow, with fish growing 0.7 inches below state average rates., 77566=1965, 58137=Appendix 1.--Gun Lake stocking summary, 1921 to present., 86237=1952, 66862=1978, 88946=1948, 76901=1966, 108=Michigan Department of Natural Resources Status of the Fishery Resource Report 91-2, 1991, 92326=1943, 97729=1935, 16097=Presently, Gun Lake is stocked annually with walleye fingerlings. Musky stocking was suspended in 1984, and has not resumed. The broodstock designation for the lake was lifted in 1985, and spearing is again allowed on the lake. The last collection of broodstock for muskies was in 1985. At that time, 115 pike and 47 muskies were taken, as well as 39 walleyes. Good habitat exists for walleye growth and reproduction, and the addition of additional spawning habitat has been considered. Good water quality should be assured by the continued operation of the Gun Lake Sewer Authority., 95697=1938, 93664=1941, 60189=1988, 90281=1946, 74241=1970, 82905=1957, 101078=1930, 91636=1944, 65527=1980, 33603=Table 2.

Carla has a grand house and lives with her maid Rosa and her handyman and lover Vittorio. Gina, her 16 year old daughter, is safely in finishing school in Switzerland, when preparations for the US Army celebrations for the freeing of the town in WW2 are underway. Immediately, Carla makes preparations to get underway, away from home, when Gina turns up unexpectedly, determined to stay and meet the men who knew her poor brave father. Meanwhile Carla has to flee, from the phone calls from three different ex-soldiers. As Carla says, when cornered by Rosa's question:""You don't know the father?"" ""Of course I know him, I just don't know who he is!"" Carla comforted three American servicemen who were billeted in succession at her small house and three weeks later - she was pregnant! Owing to this regrettable situation, which occurred at the height of the terror of the war, Carla wrote to the potential fathers requesting maintenance. Nowadays, the respectable Carla Campbell, with her big house, maid, orchards, handy man, truck and car cannot be treated by dirt by the townsfolk, especially the Contessa.

As a member of the South Oldham Rotary, every week before our meeting we recite The Four Way Test of the Things we Think, say, and do. First, Is it the Truth? Second, Is it Fair to all concerned? Third, Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Fourth, Will it be beneficial to all concerned? I love the test not just because I am a Rotarian, but because it is a constant reminder of the foundations upon which a culture of civility are constructed. The test incorporates the objective standard of what is right and includes holding to that principle in every relationship and transaction with other people. When we reject such standards of rightness and behavior, a community or nation easily slides into self-centered behavior and pursuits. The results are a dog-eat-dog world full of ethical crises. We no longer know what is right and wrong. Ã‚Â In years past, the existence of objective truth was taken for granted. It was a given that truth did exist and was knowable. But in todayÃ¢Â€Â™s postmodern culture, the idea of objective truth has taken a hit and is no longer assumed. Relativism has begun to win the day. For purposes of definition, objective truth is that which is true for all people, at all times, in all places. On the other hand, relativism holds that truth is found within each individual and is not subject to any standard outside of each person. Relativism says each personÃ¢Â€Â™s truth is their own, and hence merely dependent on oneÃ¢Â€Â™s personal preference. Depending on which of these viewpoints a community or nation holds will determine the outcome of how that culture lives life. Ideas do have consequences. When I read the news, I am amazed at the lack of an ethical and moral compass in practically every sphere of life. Sports, politics, business, corporate, even the religious sphere, abound with ethical crises. People choosing actions which our society know are wrong. According to recent editions of this newspaper, even our beloved Oldham County is not immune. I have become convinced the reason lies in a rejection of the principles of The Four Way Test. When we reject the idea that there is some objective standard of truth, then everyone simply makes up their own truth as they go. Everything becomes relative to each individualÃ¢Â€Â™s preference. Many people think of ethics like they do eating ice cream at Dairy Queen. You may prefer a vanilla cone while my favorite is a Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard, of course, exchanging the caramel for peanut butter. Neither is more right or wrong, itÃ¢Â€Â™s just what each prefers. In a series of columns, I will address some cultural issues in which this issue of truth plays a vital role. If we get this one right, the rest fall into line. But reject the idea of truth, and chaos, confusion, pain, anger, and oppression of people will result. People will be cheated, hurt, unjustly treated, lose their retirement savings to crooks, and a whole host of other cultural pathologies. Without an ethical standard, we have no basis upon which to figure out if Adolf Hitler was any better than Mother Teresa. Both were merely doing what they preferred. Without some objective truth, you will rightly ask the question of me: Why should I read what you write? And further, Why should I listen to anyone trying to persuade or teach me anything? If everything is preference, and there is no objective reality and truth, why should I spend my time and life listening to you express your mere preference? Good question. If there is no truth, then the writer who writes is merely giving an opinion which is no better than another person giving the opposite opinion. Neither is there any reason to listen to any scientist. I am always amazed at a scientist or philosopher who says he is a relativist but then tells me I should listen to a new truth he has discovered about the world, or medicine, or nature. If there is no truth, he is merely giving an opinion which is no better than what an untrained mind would say. Same goes with educators who teach a relativistic worldview. If they are not certain they have the truth, why should we spend time trying to learn from them? What makes their opinion any better than someone elseÃ¢Â€Â™s? In the next few weeks, I will discuss why a belief in objective reality is not only reasonable, but vital to a community of civility, and a culture worth passing on to our children and grandchildren. When Herbert Taylor came up with The Four Way Test in 1932 and decided all business transactions would be subjected to those principles, his Club Aluminum Co. was swimming in red ink. Furthermore, the country was in the midst of The Great Depression. However, five years later the business was not only surviving, but thriving. These principles of truth are timeless and necessary not only then, but now as well. The RotaryÃ¢Â€Â™s Four Way Test principles are more than good suggestions. They are key to sustaining a vibrant and healthy business, family, nation, and any other community of human relationships. That is not just an opinion, itÃ¢Â€Â™s the truth.}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:53:22 +0000"

A widget package contains zero or more localized files. All files and folders, except for the digital signatures and the configuration document, can be localized via folder-based localization. Unlocalized content is content included in the widget package or in the configuration document that has not been explicitly localized. In the case of a widget package, this means content outside the container for localized content. In the case of a configuration document, this means any element without an explicitly declared or inherited xml:lang attribute. Localized content is content an author has explicitly localized: that is, a widget package that contains content localized using folder-based localization or a configuration document that contains content localized via element-based localization. Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale). Internationalization, or i18n, is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.

After a ""productive"" pre-season, Sauber head to Melbourne with their all-new look of Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez... For all the latest F1 odds on the Australian GP, the opening round of the 2013 F1 Championship, visit Sky Bet. Nico Hulkenberg: ""Finally the start of the season is coming closer. I left Europe yesterday. I'm really looking forward to this race, as Australia is always one of my favorite Grands Prix, and Melbourne has a very special atmosphere, so I'm keen to be there. I also like the track which is not a permanent circuit. We are driving around a lake in a park and, especially during the drivers' parade, you feel very close to the fans. ""The track itself is very challenging for the drivers. It has got a lot of bumps and you have to know how best to deal with them. In terms of competitiveness, the final Barcelona test showed we are quite well prepared but still have some homework to do, and that we still have room for improvement in certain areas. But I'm confident the baseline is good. I'm really looking forward to racing against the usual grid and finally get a clear picture of where everybody stands with regard to performance."" Esteban Gutierrez: ""Now we have finalised the pre-season testing, I feel very grateful for the work of every team member and the opportunity to get up to speed with the basics of F1. Melbourne will be my first race in F1 and I'm sure it will be very special. It's a track that I don't know, but I'm confident I will be able to learn it quickly in the free practice sessions. ""Competing in a Formula One race is the next step in my career, and that's what I need to focus on. One of the things that I need to do is feel natural and relaxed in my surroundings so I can focus on the most important elements during the weekend. I feel I have a good base for the start of the season, but, of course, I will keep on working as I have areas were I can improve. My goal is to exploit the car's potential and finish consistently within the points."" Tom McCullough, Head of Track Engineering: ""We have had a very productive pre-season test programme completing 5,308 km, which is a credit to all those involved with the design, manufacture and operation. Nico and Esteban have quickly settled into their new working environment and have already established strong working relationships within the team, which is very important. You never know exactly where you sit compared to the other teams during winter testing, but importantly the C32 has performed as expected which is encouraging. ""Melbourne is a typical street circuit with significant track evolution. It is very important to have good braking stability and a car that performs well in the low to medium speed corners. The layout of the track also requires the car to have a good change of direction. It will be interesting to see how the new generation Medium and Super Soft Pirelli tyres perform at a track with less high speed corners than our two test tracks.

For all the latest F1 odds on the Australian GP, the opening round of the 2013 F1 Championship, visit Sky Bet. Nico Hulkenberg: ""Finally the start of the season is coming closer. I left Europe yesterday. I'm really looking forward to this race, as Australia is always one of my favorite Grands Prix, and Melbourne has a very special atmosphere, so I'm keen to be there. I also like the track which is not a permanent circuit. We are driving around a lake in a park and, especially during the drivers' parade, you feel very close to the fans. ""The track itself is very challenging for the drivers. It has got a lot of bumps and you have to know how best to deal with them. In terms of competitiveness, the final Barcelona test showed we are quite well prepared but still have some homework to do, and that we still have room for improvement in certain areas. But I'm confident the baseline is good. I'm really looking forward to racing against the usual grid and finally get a clear picture of where everybody stands with regard to performance."" Esteban Gutierrez: ""Now we have finalised the pre-season testing, I feel very grateful for the work of every team member and the opportunity to get up to speed with the basics of F1. Melbourne will be my first race in F1 and I'm sure it will be very special. It's a track that I don't know, but I'm confident I will be able to learn it quickly in the free practice sessions. ""Competing in a Formula One race is the next step in my career, and that's what I need to focus on. One of the things that I need to do is feel natural and relaxed in my surroundings so I can focus on the most important elements during the weekend. I feel I have a good base for the start of the season, but, of course, I will keep on working as I have areas were I can improve. My goal is to exploit the car's potential and finish consistently within the points."" Tom McCullough, Head of Track Engineering: ""We have had a very productive pre-season test programme completing 5,308 km, which is a credit to all those involved with the design, manufacture and operation. Nico and Esteban have quickly settled into their new working environment and have already established strong working relationships within the team, which is very important. You never know exactly where you sit compared to the other teams during winter testing, but importantly the C32 has performed as expected which is encouraging. ""Melbourne is a typical street circuit with significant track evolution. It is very important to have good braking stability and a car that performs well in the low to medium speed corners. The layout of the track also requires the car to have a good change of direction. It will be interesting to see how the new generation Medium and Super Soft Pirelli tyres perform at a track with less high speed corners than our two test tracks. It is important we maximise our full potential from the start of the season, as all the signs are that the grid will continue to be close.

Ã‚Â  Recognized for their accomplishments were L.D. Brinkman of Kerrville, Texas; Verlene Norton Cole of Oak Grove, George Dale of Clinton, Floyd Furr of Picayune, Mickey Hudson of Ellisville and Louis A. Hurst Jr. of Houston. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is a really, really special class,Ã¢Â€? said Dr. William Lewis, PRCC president. Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen you hear about some of the things theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve done, itÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing that they passed through Pearl River Community College.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â  The alumni were honored with a reception and dinner at Southern Oaks House and Gardens in Hattiesburg. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœNever in my wildest dreams did I think an old country girl from Oak Grove would receive such an award,Ã¢Â€? Cole said. Ã‚Â  Cole, the first female officer of what is now Bancorp South, received the collegeÃ¢Â€Â™s Citizenship Award when she graduated in 1951 and since her retirement in 1989 has been active in the PRCC Alumni Association, Development Foundation and Wildcat Club. Ã‚Â  Hudson, chief executive officer of HudsonÃ¢Â€Â™s Inc., was a Pearl River student in the early 1960s. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœI did have a great experience at Pearl River a long time ago,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã¢Â€ÂœPearl River has been good to me. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s great to be a Wildcat.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â  A retired petroleum geologist, Furr counts four major decisions that led to his successful professional and personal life. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœThe first was when I decided to go to Pearl River Junior College,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã¢Â€ÂœAfter that, all the other decisions fell into place. I want to thank Pearl River college for putting me on the right road.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â  Dale, who served 32 years as MississippiÃ¢Â€Â™s elected insurance commissioner, was Baptist Student Union president and played on one of Pearl RiverÃ¢Â€Â™s 13 state championship basketball teams. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœDuring the 51 years of my professional career, IÃ¢Â€Â™ve received a number of awards,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã¢Â€ÂœI have to say being a member of the Ã¢Â€Â˜59-Ã¢Â€Â˜60 state championship basketball team has got to top them all.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â  But his time at the college provided more than a sports thrill, he said. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœIn 1958-1960 when I was a Pearl River College ... we all knew that two years at junior college would give us a better opportunity in this world,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã‚Â  A Poplarville native, Hurst attended college at Pearl River for one year before serving in the Navy during World War II. H retired from the FederalÃ‚Â Ã‚Â  Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1982 as assistant director of the four-state Memphis region. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœI have many fond memories of Pearl River College and what I was taught there has served me very well in countless ways,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã‚Â  An entrepreneur, cattle rancher and collector of western art, Brinkman came to Pearl River as manager of the football team under the late coach Dobie Holden. He credits Holden with teaching him to do things right the first time, a foundation of his success. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Mississippi community college organization is the best organization in the state,Ã¢Â€? he said. Ã¢Â€ÂœThey donÃ¢Â€Â™t get credit for it. They didnÃ¢Â€Â™t get credit 60 years ago. Just think of all the kids who wouldnÃ¢Â€Â™t go to college without it.Ã¢Â€? Ã‚Â  As part of a continuing partnership between the Lifetime Achievement Hall of Fame and PRCCÃ¢Â€Â™s Honors Institute, students videotaped conversations with each of the honorees, asking them for advice. Ã‚Â  Ã¢Â€ÂœThe folks that we induct tonight are setting the stage for these students,Ã¢Â€? Lewis said., 18865=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2012-2013 by Pearl River Community College. All rights reserved.

The theatre is situated next to Crown Court Church and opposite the Theatre Royal. It was the first theatre to be built in London after the end of World War I. The theatre opened, as the Fortune Thriller Theatre on August 8, 1924, with Sinners by Lawrence Cowen. An author and playwright, Cowen commissioned the theatre in an Italianate style, that stands on the site of the old Albion Tavern, a public house that was frequented by Georgian and Victorian actors. Since 1989 the theatre has hosted the long running play The Woman in Black, which was adapted by Stephen Mallatratt from the book of the same name by Susan Hill. A celebration was held in 2001 to mark the 5000th performance. From 9 to 13 September 2008, the show was performed in Japanese by Takaya Kamikaya and Haruhito Saito, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the UK and Japan The theatre was also used to record the Lily Savage video ""Paying the Rent"" in 1993, which was later broadcast by channel four in the UK in 1996. With 432 seats in the auditorium, it is believed to be the second smallest West End theatre. It was refurbished in 1960. The theatre's famous figurine, Terpsichore (perched high above the entrance) was sculpted by M H Crichton of the Bromsgrove Guild, a noted company of artisans from Worcestershire. The theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in May 1994. Since the demolition of the original Wembley Stadium, the theatre is now the oldest remaining public building designed wholly using concrete as a textured and exposed faÃƒÂ§ade., 1008=July 2015}",,"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 02:40:41 GMT"

Ã¢Â†Â’ Search Market Forecasts Ã¢Â†Â’ Our Methodology, 4785=United States urban Consumer Price Index (CPI) The U.S. Consumer Price Index is a measure of change in the price of consumer goods and services purchased by households. The CPI is defined by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics as ""a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services."" To calculate the CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics considers the price of goods and services from various categories: housing, transportation, apparel, food & beverage, medical care, recreation, education and other/uncategorized. The CPI is a useful measure, as it indicates how the cost of urban living in the United States has changed over time, compared to a base period. CPI is also used to calculate inflation, or change in the purchasing power of money. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. urban CPI has been rising steadily since 1992. As of 2012, the CPI was 229.6, up from 179.9 ten years earlier and up from 140.3 twenty years earlier. This indicates the extent to which, compared to a base period 1982-1984 = 100, the price of various goods and services has risen. Rising food prices, for example have already affected consumers in North America. In 2012, fifty percent of survey respondents in North America reported that rising food prices had a major impact on their grocery purchases. Looking forward, the International Monetary Fund projects that the CPI will continue to rise in the next few years, reaching 251.89 in the year 2017.}","{34097=12-month percentage of change in the United States' Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) in June 2015, by expenditure category, 32521=Monthly Producer Price Index (PPI) for commodities in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 43307=Inflation rate forecast: Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United Kingdom (UK) for 1st quarter 2015 to 4th quarter 2016, 36335=Monthly chained inflation rate in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 44115=Inflation rate: Percentage change on a year earlier of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United Kingdom (UK) from January 2014 to April 2015, 40367=Monthly Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 41098=Forecasted consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2014 to 2019, by institution*, 29974=Monthly percentage of change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 33314=Producer Price Index (PPI) for commodities in the United States from 1990 to 2014, 31206=Annual inflation rate in the United States from 1990 to 2014, 30629=Annual chained inflation rate in the United States from 2001 to 2012, 42546=Consumer Price Index (CPI) in China as of June 2015, by sector and area, 39599=Monthly percentage of change in the Producer Price Index for finished goods in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 37117=Monthly percentage of change in the Producer Price Index for crude goods in the United States from December 2012 to December 2013, 34914=Monthly chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U) of all urban consumers in the United States from June 2014 to June 2015, 37977=Monthly percentage of change in the Producer Price Index for intermediate goods in the United States from December 2012 to December 2013, 41831=Consumer Price Index (CPI) in China in June 2015, by region, 35669=Chained consumer price index (C-CPI-U) of all urban consumers in the United States from 2000 to 2012, 31779=Personal income in the United States from 1990 to 2014 (in billion U.S. dollars), 38785=12-month percent changes in the Producer Price Index for finished goods in the U.S. from June 2014 to June 2015}",

Ã‚Â Designed to withstand abuse from jagged structure and monster bass, the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill SwimbaitÃ¢Â€Â™s detailed scaling, laser lifelike printing, and 3D eyes create a durable and attractive swimbait that gets bit. A multi-jointed construction brings to life the smooth, natural action and helps it maintain a consistent depth with a moderate-to-fast retrieve.Ã‚Â  Crafted with an incredible attention to detail and the utmost quality, the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill Swimbait comes with two Owner ST-41 hooks - the rear hook is positioned on a rotating swivel to prevent acrobatic fish from coming loose. Rounding out the design of the GotÃ¢Â€Â™em Coach Real Gill Swimbait is its fiber strand tail that adds an outstanding level of realism to the already impressive appearance.Ã‚Â  Customer Reviews Description Got'Em Coach Real Gill Swimbait - $49.99",Click on the logo to read their review.,True,4,0,,"{15507=Comments: The Got'em Coach bait is greatly over priced at $70. This is a made in china bait that costs about $5 to make. If this bait was $25 then it would be decent because I would compare it to other baits in the price range. at $70 You must compare it to other bluegill baits in that range and that's where it fails miserably. The 3:16, Matt's, Rago's, and even the JSJ are far superior quality in just about every aspect. The Got'em bait does get bit but not very often and big fish are even more rare. The bait looks good in the pictures but when you actually hold one in your hands you can see the lack of quality and the overall cheap feel. If the bait was a great producer I could over look this, but it's not. I would rank this bait slightly behind the Ty lures gill. Again $70 is just way to much for this bait and the lack of results. if it was $25 it would be a decent substitute bait if you could not find, or afford a high quality bait.}",

Ã‚Â  You wrote that you held the sponge in the chiller for 6 hours. Ã‚Â  I don't think this is best practice. Ã‚Â  The idea of the sponge is to kickstart fermentation since you are using such a high proportion of sour in the formula. Ã‚Â  I ferment for 4 hours maximum, and aim to hold the sponge just over 30*C if possible. Ã‚Â  Retarding rye paste at any point seems pointless to me. A couple of pointers for you. Ã‚Â  Yes do watch the hydration, although I have found the temperature at which you make the scald to be of greatest significance. Ã‚Â  The hotter the mix, the greater the degree of gelatinisation. Ã‚Â  Given Andrew Whitley aims for 100% hydration in his Russian Rye breads these days, I would be loathe to advise you to follow this; baking out such a high hydration is very difficult indeed. Good job! I am really glad you managed to find some of the ingredients you were looking for to make this bread.

SportsCenter kicks off another week of big shows with obviously the biggest topic of the day being the Carmelo Anthony saga. They said that the New Jersey Nets deal is essentially dead, which is bittersweet to me. On one end I would love to have a franchise player like Carmelo Anthony, a perennial MVP candidate, on my favorite team, butÃ‚Â on the other hand, giving up Derrick Favors, Devin Harris and draft picks for him? I do not really like that. The Nets have a new coach and a new look and this is their year, Carmelo Anthony or not.moreless thefanof, Sep 30, 2010 By 6.0 9/27 SUBMIT REVIEW Rate Now 1 Your Rating:","See All Cast & Crew Trivia, Notes, Quotes and Allusions FILTER BY TYPE All (0) Trivia (0) Quotes (0) Notes (0) Allusions (0) TRIVIA (0) ADD TRIVIA ADD TRIVIA from this episode.

The time i used them was not bad however I sent them a clear ""Please cancel"" email on July 20, 2013. I subseuqnetly conversed with several people at the company who were aware I had cancelled. They secretly billed me for an extra year claiming I had not completed the cancelation by filling out some form (through my admin panel which of course I could not access since my account was canceled). I had several phone calls with them and explained the situation. The CRM staff were rude, unhelpful and generally would not reverse the extra year of billing. In my unbiased opinion, this company should be avoided at all costs until such time as they can rectify their customer service problems. I would HIGHlY RECOMMEND AVOIDING MyHosting.com and using a more reputable hosting provider instead. It is a shame given they are so close to being a good company., 7794=MyHosting is a Canadian web hosting company which has been providing website hosting services since 1997. It claims to have 50,000 customers in 180 countries., 39521=One of the best things about MyHosting, isn't the 100% uptime (in 2 years I've never had a loss of service), or the superb security systems in place (my last host provider got hacked, and over 1000 people lost their website data) preventing hackers from tampering, or even the android app that lets me monitor my systems and subscriptions at all times from my phone, or even the grace period when it's a hard month and I can't quite afford the bill yet, or the stellar support they offer... The best thing about them, in my opinion, is how they allow you to adjust your VPS resources at ANY time. It's simply perfect. When you run a business on the internet, you know that sometimes you don't need 32GB of ram. Sometimes, you just need 6. Other times you need more bandwidth, and rather than lose traffic, you can just adjust a gui slider and get the bandwidth you need, at incredibly affordable rates. It's exactly the level of control I need, combined with exactly the level of quality I expect for my money.}","{117799=Good hosting service provider, helpful support and cheap price. But... do not use their Windows 2003 VPS... it is really bad. Use their new 2012 Windows Server instead!, 344235=The ticket (#303876) opened on 08-08-2008 is to this day still unresolved. It has been marked resolved (more than once) by MyHosting despite their failure to reply to or explain the massive downtime. The server downtime ticket covers around 30 hours from May through August 2008. There have been subsequent periods of downtime., 49557=I am currently working in France with a 6 hour time difference relative to Toronto. I get excellent phone support from MyHosting.com at 9:00 am my time which is 3:00 am Toronto time. For me, this 24/7 support is extremely important. I have recommended MyHosting.com for several customers and friends., 246226=In April 2013, when the ""Global WordPress Attack"" was happening, MyHosting sent an email alerting us to the issue. They then also temporarily locked down WordPress sites so that the attack could not succeed. In all this, they kept us informed with detailed emails., 14277=MyHosting offers both Windows 2008 and Linux hosting. Personal plans are Linux-only, while business and e-commerce plans offer both platforms for the price of one. VPS plans are also available with Windows or Linux., 51833=Since we established our company in 2005 we hosted our website with several hosting companies starting with GoDdaddy, iweb, BlueHost, HostGator, KnownHost, Linode and ending with iPage., 283829=I had been using this service since 2003. They used to be good. They appear to be running this business from a basement somewhere. I haven't received mail in three days and the foreign people who work there are totally at sea. Their spam filters suck (or are non-existent) The people who work there are very good at apologizing, but not so good with the English language. i have to filter the mail from my domain name through Google who have superior filters....and when I don't do that, I get tons of spam and and phishing messages (yesterday there were five of those....allegedly from Citibank, American Express, UPS, Bank of America, and Barclay's....referring to ""my account"" and I don't have one with any of those companies. They are good at passing the buck, saying it's Google's fault...However, I get mail fine at my Google account and used to get my domain name's mail filtered through there...but somehow that does not work any longer and MyHosting appears to have lost all the mail I've received in the last three days. I'm backing up my web site and moving my domain name elsewhere., 83782=Almost all of the better hosting companies have comparable features and functionality offerings. Pricing can make a difference also, and I think MyHosting.com compares favorably, but there is one thing that separates MyHostng.com from the crowd, and that is - customer service and support (okay, maybe that's 2). MyHosting.com is incredibly dedicated to resolving issues, providing responsive feedback and seeing any problem through to resolution in just the quickest manner possible. The technical ability of the staff at all levels, from front line contacts to back-end wizards, is better than any I have come across in the business. I have been a software developer since 1974, I know when people are capable. The staff at MyHosting are extremely capable!, 52036=Starting February, 7 2014 we moved to MyHosing.com, since this time we experienced the real meaning of business hosting. they care about every thing and provides a really guru support team. I have to mention that among all companies we have hosted with, we experienced the real meaning of support with myHosing and KnownHost. They never told us, we can not. although I have to mention that linode has a great support too., 343879=I have been a shared hosting account holder for about 10 years. Over these years I have had very little need for support, so when I began suffering extended and frequent server downtimes in summer 2008 I opened a support ticket. The site server uptime is currently 99.48% which is mediocre considering the premium cost and basic features., 355269=WhoIsHostingThis.com is operated by Quality Nonsense Ltd, a company registered in England and Wales. Company No. 05889123. VAT No. 879480072. Registered office: 27 Mortimer Street, London, W1T 3BL, UK. Ã‚Â© 2007-2015 WhoIsHostingThis.com., 157895=My hosting.com has been a fantastic, user-friendly experience that has really been the best answer to all of my website needs for our business which we started in 2001. When the switch over from CLASSIC to ONCLOUD happened, I was very frustrated, until support walked me through it patiently and I found out it was even better than the other. This product has been an amazing and key part of any business I've started, from the numerous websites I've made for others to my own business websites. Thank you! Keep it up!}",

With the U.S. economy getting its groove back, the first two quarters of 2014 showed encouraging demand trends for chemicals and continued recovery across end-use markets such as commercial construction and electronics after being in a rut for the most part of 2013. The chemical industry also saw a pick-up in consolidation activities so far this year. Although some industry-specific challenges and slow economic recovery in Europe remain roadblocks, the industry is expected to continue to recuperate through the balance of 2014, backed by cost benefits from a shale gas boom in the U.S. and significant capital investment. Chemical makers are ramping up investment on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies which is expected to beef up capacity and export in 2014 and beyond. Strength across agriculture and automotive markets in North America and healthy demand in emerging geographies represent tailwinds for the industry. A gradually convalescing housing market also augur well for recovery prospects this year and the next. The Industry in a Nutshell Chemicals are used to make consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry -- a roughly $5 trillion global business Ã¢Â€Â“ itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp, paper and primary metals. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a more than $800 billion enterprise. It is cyclical by nature and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. and world economies. The chemical industry touches 96% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products. The U.S. chemical industry represents more than 15% of the global chemical output and constitutes roughly 12% of the nation's exports. Roughly 6 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry. The U.S. chemical industry supports around 25% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) which is expected to have a 2.8% share of total earnings for the S&P 500 in 2014. We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. The way to look at the complete list of 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #177 and higher) is negative. We have three chemicals related industries: Chemical Specialty, Chemical Plastics and Chemical Diversified. Both Chemical Specialty and Chemical Plastics industries lie in the middle one-third with a Zacks Industry Rank #90 and #110, respectively. The Chemical Diversified industry currently retains a Zacks Industry Rank #225, placing it in the bottom 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is leaning toward Ã¢Â€Â˜Neutral.Ã¢Â€Â™ Sector Level Earnings Trends Looking at the overall results of the broader Basic Materials sector, earnings for 95.2% of the sector participants in the S&P 500 index reported so far are up 11.9% in second-quarter 2014, a marked turn around from a 2.4% fall in the first. Total revenues for these companies are up 3.7% in the second quarter versus a 1.4% rise a quarter ago. The sector racked up a healthy earnings beat ratio (the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 70% and revenue beat ratio of 50% in the second quarter. The earnings momentum is expected to continue into the third quarter with a projected rise of 9.7%. Revenues are forecast to move up 1.5% in the quarter. For 2014, earnings are expected to show an 8.3% increase, further accelerating to a 19.4% rise next year. Revenues are forecast to expand 2.1% this year and 5.2% in 2015. Key Feedstock Price Trends The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY), Brent crude oil prices averaged $109 per barrel in 2013, below 2012 average of $112. Brent crude prices touched a nine-month high of $119 in Feb 2013, triggered by geopolitical tension in the Middle East, exacerbated by Iran's nuclear program. Prices eased to below $100 in Apr 2013 on weak demand outlook for oil. Brent crude has hovered between a high of roughly $116 and a low of $104 so far this year, averaging at around $110. Prices crossed $115 in Jun 2014 on concerns over possible supply disruption stemming from violence in Iraq. The price of the other key raw material, naphtha, which is produced from oil, ranged between $985 per metric ton and $820 per metric ton in 2013, based on the BASF report. Naphtha prices averaged $902 last year, lower than the 2012 average of $937. The average annual price of natural gas in the U.S. was $3.73 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2013, higher than $2.75 in 2012. Chemical Industry on the Mend The chemical industry is poised for a recovery this year and the next. The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry trade group, foresees national chemical output (excluding pharma) to rise 2.5% in 2014 (up from a 1.6% increase in 2013) and further improve to a 3.5% gain next year. Growth will be backed by strong agricultural market fundamentals, healthy demand from light vehicles market and a recovery in the housing market. U.S. chemical exports are expected to cross $200 billion this year and rise roughly 8% annually through 2018, leading to continued generation of trade surplus. Trade in chemicals is expected to rise with a recovery in global manufacturing activities. On the global front, ACC sees production to move up 3.8% in 2014 and 4.1% in 2015 with healthy gains expected across North America and emerging markets. The ACC expects strong capital spending in the coming years, stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives. It envisions U.S. capital spending to reach $61.2 billion by 2018. The shale gas boom is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U.S. The ACC expects U.S. chemical shipment value to surpass $1 trillion and the industry to rake in record trade surpluses by 2018, partly boosted by significant share gas-driven chemical capacity. According to the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), which represents the European chemicals industry, chemical output will rise 2% this year following a 0.2% fall in 2013. The gain will be driven by increasing demand from customer industries (especially automakers) and stabilization in construction markets. While CEFIC expects continued growth in production in 2015, it expects output to rise at a slower pace (of 1.5%) next year. Pace of growth is expected to be stymied by high-energy prices that place European chemical makers at considerable disadvantage versus their North American counterparts. OPPORTUNITIES Shale Bounty Driving Chemical Spending According to the ACC, emerging market growth and favorable oil-to-gas price ratios resulting from abundant shale gas production are driving U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets, including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and healthy demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane in the process. Leveraging the abundant natural gas supply and cost advantage, chemical companies are investing billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) that produce ethylene from ethane. The U.S. has emerged as an attractive investment location and chemical makers are aggressively expanding capacity in the country. According to an ACC report, potential domestic chemical investment related to share gas has reached as high as $100 billion, more than 50% of which are from firms outside of the U.S. Already 148 projects -- backed by Federal government support -- have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies. These projects may lead to $81 billion in new chemical industry output annually and 637,000 permanent new jobs by 2023. Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years. Agriculture: A Lucrative Prospect Major chemical makers are increasingly shifting their focus on businesses that cater to agriculture and health and nutrition markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure. In particular, agriculture is emerging as a lucrative market as evident from recent trends. Strong planting activity by growers across North and Latin America, solid order book and healthy supply of seeds and crop protection products represent driving factors. Strategic Measures: M&A Heating Up Chemical companies remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still challenging economic environment. These companies continue to explore growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The chemical industry is expected to witness high levels of consolidation activities in 2014 with some major deals have already been announced this year including Albemarle Corp.Ã¢Â€Â™s (ALB) proposed buyout of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (ROK - Analyst Report) for $6.2 billion. Chemical makers are also divesting non-core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses. Moreover, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies -- including plant closures and headcount reduction -- are expected to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions could be directed for growth initiatives. Recovery in Chinese Demand Recovery in China, a major market, is expected to continue through the balance of 2014. Government stimulus actions coupled with efforts to stem inflation appear to bear fruit and exports to the U.S. and other key markets are regaining momentum. Strength in the automotive market represents another positive. An improved demand outlook for China bodes well for the chemical industry this year. Stocks We Like Chemical stocks that look good in the prevailing operating backdrop include LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB - Analyst Report), Celanese Corp. (CE - Analyst Report), The Dow Chemical Company (DOW - Analyst Report), PPG Industries Inc. (PPG - Analyst Report), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW - Analyst Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN - Analyst Report). WEAKNESSES Macro Headwinds While there have been some signs of improvement of late, the European economy is still not out of the woods. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand, thus remaining a source of near-term uncertainty. In addition, given the chemical industry's sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical makers. In addition, demand from some of the major manufacturing industries remains below their historic highs. While non-residential construction activities are improving, the market remains way below its peak levels. Pricing, FX Pressure Commodity prices, though subsiding of late, still remain a concern for many of the U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers may be under pressure. In addition, chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Currency exchange translation remains a headwind for these companies. A Still-Cloudy Fertilizer Space Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals makers continue to face challenges from weak pricing, affecting their margins. Prices for potash have been under pressure following the exit of world's largest potash maker Uralkali Group from one of the biggest potash cartels -- the Belarus Potash Company (BPC) -- that influence potash pricing by controlling the production and supply. Uralkali's Board decided to end export sales through BPC and direct all potash export through its Switzerland-based trade arm Uralkali Trading. Moreover, demand for potash and phosphate remains somewhat weak in India, a key import market. Potash subsidy cuts by the Indian government coupled with a weak local currency contributing to depressed demand for the nutrient in that country. Moreover, the demand environment for phosphate will remain uncertain in India in second-half 2014 due to monsoon rainfall. Stocks Warrant Caution We hold a bearish view on FMC Corp. (FMC - Analyst Report), DuPont (DD - Analyst Report), Methanex Corp. (MEOH - Analyst Report) and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD). We steer clear of certain companies in the fertilizer space.

Although some industry-specific challenges and slow economic recovery in Europe remain roadblocks, the industry is expected to continue to recuperate through the balance of 2014, backed by cost benefits from a shale gas boom in the U.S. and significant capital investment. Chemical makers are ramping up investment on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies which is expected to beef up capacity and export in 2014 and beyond. Strength across agriculture and automotive markets in North America and healthy demand in emerging geographies represent tailwinds for the industry. A gradually convalescing housing market also augur well for recovery prospects this year and the next. The Industry in a Nutshell Chemicals are used to make consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry -- a roughly $5 trillion global business Ã¢Â€Â“ itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp, paper and primary metals. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a more than $800 billion enterprise. It is cyclical by nature and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. and world economies. The chemical industry touches 96% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products. The U.S. chemical industry represents more than 15% of the global chemical output and constitutes roughly 12% of the nation's exports. Roughly 6 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry. The U.S. chemical industry supports around 25% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) which is expected to have a 2.8% share of total earnings for the S&P 500 in 2014. We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. The way to look at the complete list of 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #177 and higher) is negative. We have three chemicals related industries: Chemical Specialty, Chemical Plastics and Chemical Diversified. Both Chemical Specialty and Chemical Plastics industries lie in the middle one-third with a Zacks Industry Rank #90 and #110, respectively. The Chemical Diversified industry currently retains a Zacks Industry Rank #225, placing it in the bottom 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is leaning toward Ã¢Â€Â˜Neutral.Ã¢Â€Â™ Sector Level Earnings Trends Looking at the overall results of the broader Basic Materials sector, earnings for 95.2% of the sector participants in the S&P 500 index reported so far are up 11.9% in second-quarter 2014, a marked turn around from a 2.4% fall in the first. Total revenues for these companies are up 3.7% in the second quarter versus a 1.4% rise a quarter ago. The sector racked up a healthy earnings beat ratio (the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 70% and revenue beat ratio of 50% in the second quarter. The earnings momentum is expected to continue into the third quarter with a projected rise of 9.7%. Revenues are forecast to move up 1.5% in the quarter. For 2014, earnings are expected to show an 8.3% increase, further accelerating to a 19.4% rise next year. Revenues are forecast to expand 2.1% this year and 5.2% in 2015. Key Feedstock Price Trends The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY), Brent crude oil prices averaged $109 per barrel in 2013, below 2012 average of $112. Brent crude prices touched a nine-month high of $119 in Feb 2013, triggered by geopolitical tension in the Middle East, exacerbated by Iran's nuclear program. Prices eased to below $100 in Apr 2013 on weak demand outlook for oil. Brent crude has hovered between a high of roughly $116 and a low of $104 so far this year, averaging at around $110. Prices crossed $115 in Jun 2014 on concerns over possible supply disruption stemming from violence in Iraq. The price of the other key raw material, naphtha, which is produced from oil, ranged between $985 per metric ton and $820 per metric ton in 2013, based on the BASF report. Naphtha prices averaged $902 last year, lower than the 2012 average of $937. The average annual price of natural gas in the U.S. was $3.73 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2013, higher than $2.75 in 2012. Chemical Industry on the Mend The chemical industry is poised for a recovery this year and the next. The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry trade group, foresees national chemical output (excluding pharma) to rise 2.5% in 2014 (up from a 1.6% increase in 2013) and further improve to a 3.5% gain next year. Growth will be backed by strong agricultural market fundamentals, healthy demand from light vehicles market and a recovery in the housing market. U.S. chemical exports are expected to cross $200 billion this year and rise roughly 8% annually through 2018, leading to continued generation of trade surplus. Trade in chemicals is expected to rise with a recovery in global manufacturing activities. On the global front, ACC sees production to move up 3.8% in 2014 and 4.1% in 2015 with healthy gains expected across North America and emerging markets. The ACC expects strong capital spending in the coming years, stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives. It envisions U.S. capital spending to reach $61.2 billion by 2018. The shale gas boom is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U.S. The ACC expects U.S. chemical shipment value to surpass $1 trillion and the industry to rake in record trade surpluses by 2018, partly boosted by significant share gas-driven chemical capacity. According to the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), which represents the European chemicals industry, chemical output will rise 2% this year following a 0.2% fall in 2013. The gain will be driven by increasing demand from customer industries (especially automakers) and stabilization in construction markets. While CEFIC expects continued growth in production in 2015, it expects output to rise at a slower pace (of 1.5%) next year. Pace of growth is expected to be stymied by high-energy prices that place European chemical makers at considerable disadvantage versus their North American counterparts. OPPORTUNITIES Shale Bounty Driving Chemical Spending According to the ACC, emerging market growth and favorable oil-to-gas price ratios resulting from abundant shale gas production are driving U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets, including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and healthy demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane in the process. Leveraging the abundant natural gas supply and cost advantage, chemical companies are investing billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) that produce ethylene from ethane. The U.S. has emerged as an attractive investment location and chemical makers are aggressively expanding capacity in the country. According to an ACC report, potential domestic chemical investment related to share gas has reached as high as $100 billion, more than 50% of which are from firms outside of the U.S. Already 148 projects -- backed by Federal government support -- have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies. These projects may lead to $81 billion in new chemical industry output annually and 637,000 permanent new jobs by 2023. Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years. Agriculture: A Lucrative Prospect Major chemical makers are increasingly shifting their focus on businesses that cater to agriculture and health and nutrition markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure. In particular, agriculture is emerging as a lucrative market as evident from recent trends. Strong planting activity by growers across North and Latin America, solid order book and healthy supply of seeds and crop protection products represent driving factors. Strategic Measures: M&A Heating Up Chemical companies remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still challenging economic environment. These companies continue to explore growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America. The chemical industry is expected to witness high levels of consolidation activities in 2014 with some major deals have already been announced this year including Albemarle Corp.Ã¢Â€Â™s (ALB) proposed buyout of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (ROK - Analyst Report) for $6.2 billion. Chemical makers are also divesting non-core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses. Moreover, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies -- including plant closures and headcount reduction -- are expected to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions could be directed for growth initiatives. Recovery in Chinese Demand Recovery in China, a major market, is expected to continue through the balance of 2014. Government stimulus actions coupled with efforts to stem inflation appear to bear fruit and exports to the U.S. and other key markets are regaining momentum. Strength in the automotive market represents another positive. An improved demand outlook for China bodes well for the chemical industry this year. Stocks We Like Chemical stocks that look good in the prevailing operating backdrop include LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB - Analyst Report), Celanese Corp. (CE - Analyst Report), The Dow Chemical Company (DOW - Analyst Report), PPG Industries Inc. (PPG - Analyst Report), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW - Analyst Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN - Analyst Report). WEAKNESSES Macro Headwinds While there have been some signs of improvement of late, the European economy is still not out of the woods. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand, thus remaining a source of near-term uncertainty. In addition, given the chemical industry's sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical makers. In addition, demand from some of the major manufacturing industries remains below their historic highs. While non-residential construction activities are improving, the market remains way below its peak levels. Pricing, FX Pressure Commodity prices, though subsiding of late, still remain a concern for many of the U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers may be under pressure. In addition, chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Currency exchange translation remains a headwind for these companies. A Still-Cloudy Fertilizer Space Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals makers continue to face challenges from weak pricing, affecting their margins. Prices for potash have been under pressure following the exit of world's largest potash maker Uralkali Group from one of the biggest potash cartels -- the Belarus Potash Company (BPC) -- that influence potash pricing by controlling the production and supply. Uralkali's Board decided to end export sales through BPC and direct all potash export through its Switzerland-based trade arm Uralkali Trading. Moreover, demand for potash and phosphate remains somewhat weak in India, a key import market. Potash subsidy cuts by the Indian government coupled with a weak local currency contributing to depressed demand for the nutrient in that country. Moreover, the demand environment for phosphate will remain uncertain in India in second-half 2014 due to monsoon rainfall. Stocks Warrant Caution We hold a bearish view on FMC Corp. (FMC - Analyst Report), DuPont (DD - Analyst Report), Methanex Corp. (MEOH - Analyst Report) and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD). We steer clear of certain companies in the fertilizer space.

(THRX - Analyst Report) recently announced the submission of a marketing application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for their pipeline candidate UMEC/VI (proposed trade name: Anoro). The companies are looking to get the candidate approved in the EU as a maintenance bronchodilator therapy (once daily) to relieve symptoms in adults suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Glaxo/Theravance are also seeking US approval of the candidate for the COPD indication. Last month, the companies announced the submission of a marketing application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of UMEC/VI for the COPD indication. UMEC/VI is a combination of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/LAMA (GSK573719 or umeclidinium bromide/UMEC) and a long-acting beta2 agonist/LABA (vilanterol/VI). We note that Glaxo along with Theravance is also developing other COPD candidates including Breo (proposed brand name Relvar in the EU, formerly known as Relovair) and MABA (GSK961081). We are positive on TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s pipeline programs in collaboration with Glaxo. We are also positive on TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s cardiovascular deal, inked in October 2012, with a big player like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK - Analyst Report). Moreover, the deals with Alfa Wassermann and R-Pharm are also encouraging. Earlier in the month, Theravance and Alfa Wassermann announced the commencement of a phase II proof-of-concept study (0093: n~32) to evaluate TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s pipeline candidate velusetrag in patients suffering from diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastrointestinal motility. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Glaxo, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We have a similar stance on Theravance. Large-cap pharma companies that currently look better-positioned include Sanofi (SNY - Analyst Report) and Novartis (NVS - Analyst Report).

The companies are looking to get the candidate approved in the EU as a maintenance bronchodilator therapy (once daily) to relieve symptoms in adults suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Glaxo/Theravance are also seeking US approval of the candidate for the COPD indication. Last month, the companies announced the submission of a marketing application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval of UMEC/VI for the COPD indication. UMEC/VI is a combination of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/LAMA (GSK573719 or umeclidinium bromide/UMEC) and a long-acting beta2 agonist/LABA (vilanterol/VI). We note that Glaxo along with Theravance is also developing other COPD candidates including Breo (proposed brand name Relvar in the EU, formerly known as Relovair) and MABA (GSK961081). We are positive on TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s pipeline programs in collaboration with Glaxo. We are also positive on TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s cardiovascular deal, inked in October 2012, with a big player like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK - Analyst Report). Moreover, the deals with Alfa Wassermann and R-Pharm are also encouraging. Earlier in the month, Theravance and Alfa Wassermann announced the commencement of a phase II proof-of-concept study (0093: n~32) to evaluate TheravanceÃ¢Â€Â™s pipeline candidate velusetrag in patients suffering from diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastrointestinal motility. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Glaxo, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We have a similar stance on Theravance.

We will never sell your email or phone number to any 3rd party or send you nasty spam. No Spam Zillow's Quality Assurance (QA) team ""mystery shops"" lenders to ensure they are honoring their quotes. Also, users can flag quotes for Zillow's QA team to investigate and review their experiences with lenders. Accuracy Promise Zillow confirms through the NMLS that lenders are licensed to originate mortgage business in the state(s) they are quoting in before they are allowed to participate in the marketplace. Confirmed Lender Annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate. The APR includes the interest rate, points, lender fees, and certain other financing charges the borrower is required to pay. Using APR to compare quotes is helpful because it takes into account both the interest rate and financing fees. The APR is calculated by Zillow. The interest rate is the yearly rate charged by a lender to a borrower in order for the borrower to obtain a loan. This is usually expressed as a percentage of the total amount loaned.

The TUG evaluation measures walking and balance.","Detailed Description: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) causes memory loss, walking, and urinary difficulties. If NPH goes unidentified and untreated it can cause severe disability. The cause of this disease is poorly understood. It may involve damage caused by impaired blood flow in the brain. The standard methods by which we diagnose patients who have symptoms of NPH are less accurate than desired. Many times patients remain undiagnosed or untreated while others receive treatment due to a false-positive diagnosis. To treat NPH, a small tube called a 'shunt' can be surgically placed in the brain to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and help relieve symptoms. Currently, the reported response rates to shunting vary from 31% to 89%. Follow-up studies have shown that the shunts may not work long-term. This could be due to the natural history of the disease, development of other diseases, or due to a short term 'placebo effect' following the shunt placement surgery. Our group is doing a study of patients with NPH. All participants in this study will have a shunt placed. These shunts are programmable and, once placed, may be opened or closed by the doctor. Programming the shunt does not require an additional surgical procedure. All study participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have their shunts open and draining. The other group will have their shunts closed (not draining). After",False,-1,0,,,

Der Marsch war schlecht konzipiert, viele VerbÃƒÂ¤nde wurden zudem kaum versorgt. Moltkes GegenmaÃƒÂŸnahmen zielten seit dem 25. August auf eine Umfassung der Armee Mac Mahons, der sich am 28.

Er verlangte die Verlegung sÃƒÂ¤mtlicher deutscher Truppen nach Frankreich, was Bismarck und Roon mit Blick auf ÃƒÂ–sterreich und von ihnen befÃƒÂ¼rchtete Unruhen in Deutschland ablehnten.[15], 58503=Drei Armeen marschierten schlieÃƒÂŸlich, gefÃƒÂ¼hrt von Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz, Prinz Friedrich Karl Nikolaus von PreuÃƒÂŸen und Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm, nach Frankreich ein. Die Franzosen wurden durch die beweglichere deutsche FÃƒÂ¼hrung ausmanÃƒÂ¶vriert, die vom preuÃƒÂŸischen Generalstab unter Helmuth von Moltke koordiniert wurde. Frankreich verlor in kurzer Folge die Schlachten von WeiÃƒÂŸenburg (4. August 1870), WÃƒÂ¶rth (6. August) und Spichern (6. August). Nach seiner Niederlage bei WÃƒÂ¶rth rÃƒÂ¤umte das franzÃƒÂ¶sische Feldheer das Elsass und ÃƒÂ¼berlieÃƒÂŸ das Rheintal der deutschen 3. Armee, die nach SÃƒÂ¼den vorrÃƒÂ¼ckte, das Elsass besetzte und schlieÃƒÂŸlich die Festung Belfort belagerte. Einzig die Zitadelle von Bitsch konnte von den Deutschen nicht eingenommen werden und ergab sich erst am 25. MÃƒÂ¤rz 1871. WÃƒÂ¤hrend die preuÃƒÂŸischen Hinterlader-ZÃƒÂ¼ndnadelgewehre gegen ÃƒÂ–sterreich 1866 noch ÃƒÂ¼berlegen gewesen waren, hatten nun die Franzosen klare Vorteile bei Reichweite und Schussfolge mit dem neuen Chassepotgewehr und dem Mitrailleuse-Maschinengewehr. DafÃƒÂ¼r waren die deutschen stÃƒÂ¤hlernen Hinterlader-GeschÃƒÂ¼tze von Alfred Krupp die ausschlaggebende Artillerie, die mit ÃƒÂ¼ber vier Kilometer mehr als die doppelte Reichweite der franzÃƒÂ¶sischen besaÃƒÂŸ. Das damals neueste dieser GeschÃƒÂ¼tze hieÃƒÂŸ C/64/67; es hatte zahlreiche Vorteile. Speziell bei der Schlacht bei Sedan zeigte sich, dass eine hohe Kadenz (bis zu zehn Schuss pro Minute) zusammen mit einer groÃƒÂŸen Reichweite bei guter Trefferleistung eine verheerende, schlachtentscheidende Wirkung erzeugte., 26486=1868 hatten spanische MilitÃƒÂ¤rs KÃƒÂ¶nigin IsabellaÃ‚Â II. abgesetzt. Seitdem suchten die Spanier in den europÃƒÂ¤ischen FÃƒÂ¼rstenhÃƒÂ¤usern nach einem AnwÃƒÂ¤rter, den das Parlament zum KÃƒÂ¶nig wÃƒÂ¤hlen kÃƒÂ¶nnte. Der angefragte portugiesischen KÃƒÂ¶nig Ferdinand II., der selbst ablehnte, verwies auf seinen Schwiegersohn: Prinz Leopold von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Spross der schwÃƒÂ¤bischen Linie der Hohenzollern. Er war gemÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂŸigt katholisch und ÃƒÂ¼ber seine GroÃƒÂŸmÃƒÂ¼tter Ã¢Â€Â“ vÃƒÂ¤terlicherseits eine Nichte und MÃƒÂ¼ndeltochter der jÃƒÂ¼ngsten Schwester Napoleons I., mÃƒÂ¼tterlicherseits dessen Adoptivtochter Ã¢Â€Â“ weit nÃƒÂ¤her mit Napoleon III. als mit den Berliner Hohenzollern verwandt. Sein jÃƒÂ¼ngerer Bruder Karl war 1866 auf nachdrÃƒÂ¼ckliche Empfehlung Napoleons III. auf den rumÃƒÂ¤nischen Thron gelangt. Der Prinz selbst hatte wenig Ambitionen auf den spanischen Thron, lehnte ihn im April 1870 auch ein erstes Mal ab, lieÃƒÂŸ sich aber von Bismarck ÃƒÂ¼berreden, die Kandidatur doch anzunehmen. Auch der preuÃƒÂŸische KÃƒÂ¶nig WilhelmÃ‚Â I. gab als Chef des Hauses Hohenzollern, wenn auch widerstrebend, seine Zustimmung., 57890=Die Kampfhandlungen begannen mit einem franzÃƒÂ¶sischen VorstoÃƒÂŸ. Sechs Divisionen griffen am 2. August deutsches Territorium an. Doch nur SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken, strategisch eher isoliert und nur von wenigen preuÃƒÂŸischen Truppen geschÃƒÂ¼tzt, wurde von den Franzosen (bis zum Lulustein) eingenommen; spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde es wieder aufgegeben. Schon am 3. August standen 320.000 Deutsche an der Grenze, weshalb eine von Napoleon III. erhoffte GroÃƒÂŸoffensive gescheitert wÃƒÂ¤re., 82070=Nach dem erfolgreichen Kriegsverlauf konnte Bismarck die sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten zum Eintritt in den Bundesstaat Norddeutscher Bund bewegen. Der BundesprÃƒÂ¤sident, der KÃƒÂ¶nig von PreuÃƒÂŸen, nahm den Titel Deutscher Kaiser an, und der Norddeutsche Bund, nach dem Beitritt der sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten kurzzeitig auch Ã¢Â€ÂDeutscher BundÃ¢Â€Âœ genannt, vergrÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸerte sich zum Deutschen Reich. Die verÃƒÂ¤nderte Verfassung trat am 1. Januar 1871 in Kraft., 73482=Ab dem 19. September wurde die franzÃƒÂ¶sische Hauptstadt belagert undÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ noch vor JahresendeÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ systematisch von den Deutschen beschossen. Dies und der Guerillakrieg der Franc-tireurs fÃƒÂ¼hrte zu einer erheblichen Verbitterung auf beiden Seiten. Der preuÃƒÂŸische Generalstab drÃƒÂ¤ngte die Kommandeure zu rÃƒÂ¼cksichtslosem Vorgehen gegen irregulÃƒÂ¤re franzÃƒÂ¶sische Truppen; Bismarck ÃƒÂ¤uÃƒÂŸerte sich im Herbst anerkennend ÃƒÂ¼ber die bayerische Kavallerie, da diese mit dem Ã¢Â€ÂTotschieÃƒÂŸenÃ¢Â€Âœ von FreischÃƒÂ¤rlern Ã¢Â€Ârasch bei der HandÃ¢Â€Âœ[12] sei., 23316=PreuÃƒÂŸen ging gestÃƒÂ¤rkt aus dem Konflikt mit ÃƒÂ–sterreich und dem Deutschen Bund hervor. Als Folge des Deutschen Krieges annektierte PreuÃƒÂŸen das KÃƒÂ¶nigreich Hannover und das KurfÃƒÂ¼rstentum Hessen (-Kassel), die die beiden bisherigen Teile PreuÃƒÂŸens trennten, auÃƒÂŸerdem das Herzogtum Nassau und die Freie Stadt Frankfurt. In einigen thÃƒÂ¼ringischen Kleinstaaten wie z. B. dem Herzogtum Sachsen-Meiningen erzwang PreuÃƒÂŸen die Abdankung der regierenden FÃƒÂ¼rsten zugunsten ihrer Thronfolger. Der Deutsche Bund wurde aufgelÃƒÂ¶st, ÃƒÂ–sterreich schied als deutscher Staat aus und PreuÃƒÂŸen wurde Vormacht in Deutschland. 1867 grÃƒÂ¼ndeten PreuÃƒÂŸen und weitere 21 deutsche Staaten den Norddeutschen Bund, was in Frankreich als Provokation angesehen wurde. Bismarck hatte NapoleonÃ‚Â III. zugesagt, das norddeutsche BÃƒÂ¼ndnis nicht ÃƒÂ¼ber den Main hinaus zu erweitern, und kam dem auch nach. Allerdings schloss er mit den sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten (auÃƒÂŸer ÃƒÂ–sterreich und Liechtenstein) nicht nur FriedensvertrÃƒÂ¤ge, sondern auch geheime Schutz- und TrutzbÃƒÂ¼ndnisse (gegenseitige Verteidigung im Falle eines Angriffskriegs), da es ihm gelungen war, durch schonende Behandlung das Vertrauen der sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten zu gewinnen., 12641=AuslÃƒÂ¶ser war der Streit zwischen Frankreich und PreuÃƒÂŸen um die Frage der spanischen Thronkandidatur eines Hohenzollernprinzen. Der preuÃƒÂŸische MinisterprÃƒÂ¤sident Otto von Bismarck lieÃƒÂŸ die Emser Depesche, mit der er darÃƒÂ¼ber informiert worden war, dass KÃƒÂ¶nig Wilhelm I. die franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Forderungen abgelehnt hatte, in provokant verkÃƒÂ¼rzter Form verÃƒÂ¶ffentlichen. Dies erregte auf beiden Seiten nationalistische EmpÃƒÂ¶rung und veranlasste den franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Kaiser NapolÃƒÂ©on III. am 19. Juli 1870 zur KriegserklÃƒÂ¤rung an PreuÃƒÂŸen., 94378=Bismarck zementierte mit der von ihm betriebenen Kaiserproklamation die Teilung des ehemaligen Territoriums des Heiligen RÃƒÂ¶mischen Reichs Deutscher Nation in ein kleindeutsches Deutsches Reich und dieÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ mittlerweile durch den Ausgleich von 1867 geschaffeneÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ Doppelmonarchie ÃƒÂ–sterreich-Ungarn, die als VielvÃƒÂ¶lkerstaat unter der Herrschaft der Habsburger fortbestand., 70279=Mit dem Untergang der ArmÃƒÂ©e de Chalons und der nicht mehr zu durchbrechenden EinschlieÃƒÂŸung der Rheinarmee in Metz geriet die franzÃƒÂ¶sische KriegfÃƒÂ¼hrung in eine schwere Krise. Die Feldarmee war bis auf das bei Sedan entwichene 13. Korps ausgeschaltet. Der preuÃƒÂŸische Generalstab hielt es fÃƒÂ¼r ausgeschlossen, dass der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Staat, der nur noch auf etwa 100.000 ausgebildete Soldaten und Offiziere zurÃƒÂ¼ckgreifen konnte, in nennenswertem Umfang Neuaufstellungen vornehmen kÃƒÂ¶nne. Durch einen VorstoÃƒÂŸ auf Paris sollten der Krieg beendet und die nun offen erhobenen territorialen und finanziellen Forderungen durchgesetzt werden. Am 21. August waren die beiden elsÃƒÂ¤ssischen Departements und mehrere lothringische Arrondissements als Generalgouvernement ElsaÃƒÂŸ und Deutsch-Lothringen unter deutsche Verwaltung gestellt worden, ihre spÃƒÂ¤tere Annexion war schon zu diesem Zeitpunkt fest vorgesehen.[10], 79700=Am 31. Januar 1871 trat jedoch ein gegen den Willen Gambettas von den in Paris verbliebenen Regierungsmitgliedern um Jules Favre verhandelter, zunÃƒÂ¤chst auf 21 Tage befristeter allgemeiner Waffenstillstand in Kraft, der die Entwaffnung der Pariser Garnison und die vorÃƒÂ¼bergehende Besetzung eines Teils von Paris vorsah. Bismarck hatte zuvor gegen die weitergehenden Forderungen Moltkes, der die Gefangennahme und den Abtransport aller bei und in Paris stehenden franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Truppen (insgesamt etwa 250.000 Mann) nach Deutschland forderte, interveniert. Der gut informierte Bismarck rechnete fest damit, dass die maÃƒÂŸgeblichen politischen KrÃƒÂ¤fte in Frankreich vor allem aus innenpolitischen GrÃƒÂ¼nden davon absehen wÃƒÂ¼rden, den Kampf nach Ablauf des Waffenstillstands wieder aufzunehmen. Die von der provisorischen Regierung sehr kurzfristig fÃƒÂ¼r den 8. Februar 1871 angesetzte Wahl einer neuen Nationalversammlung wurde von den deutschen Truppen deshalb nicht behindert. Der groÃƒÂŸen Mehrheit der hierbei gewÃƒÂ¤hlten 675 Abgeordneten war vor allem an einer inneren Konsolidierung Frankreichs unter konservativen Vorzeichen gelegen; besonders die etwa 400 bourbonischen und orlÃƒÂ©anistischen Monarchisten wollten den Krieg unter allen UmstÃƒÂ¤nden beenden, um danach mit den Republikanern Ã¢Â€ÂabzurechnenÃ¢Â€Âœ und die Monarchie zu restaurieren. Um hierfÃƒÂ¼r freie Hand zu bekommen, waren sie auch zu den von deutscher Seite geforderten Gebietsabtretungen und EntschÃƒÂ¤digungszahlungen bereit. Der von der Nationalversammlung zum provisorischen Staatsoberhaupt gewÃƒÂ¤hlte Adolphe Thiers unterzeichnete am 26. Februar 1871 den Vorfrieden von Versailles. Knapp drei Wochen spÃƒÂ¤ter lÃƒÂ¶ste der Versuch der Regierung Thiers, die von linken Republikanern und Sozialisten kontrollierte Pariser Nationalgarde zu entwaffnen, den schlieÃƒÂŸlich im Mai unter den Augen der deutschen Truppen blutig niedergeschlagenen Kommune-Aufstand aus., 38251=In Frankreich gab es die Hoffnung, dass ÃƒÂ–sterreich sich an die Seite Frankreichs schlagen kÃƒÂ¶nnte, um sich fÃƒÂ¼r die Niederlage von 1866 zu revanchieren. Doch ÃƒÂ–sterreich blieb neutral. Es war schlecht vorbereitet, litt unter der Staatsschuld und wurde zudem durch Russland eingeschÃƒÂ¼chtert. Russland war nÃƒÂ¤mlich Frankreichs Gegner im Krimkrieg gewesen und durch die unerwartet feindselige Haltung ÃƒÂ–sterreichs beeintrÃƒÂ¤chtigt worden. Dies war noch nicht vergessen: Nun nahm Russland eine drohende Haltung gegen ÃƒÂ–sterreich ein, um dieses von einer UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung Frankreichs abzuhalten., 13605=Entgegen NapolÃƒÂ©ons Erwartung traten die vier sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten in ErfÃƒÂ¼llung ihrer so genannten Schutz- und TrutzbÃƒÂ¼ndnisse mit dem Norddeutschen Bund auf dessen Seite in den Krieg ein. WÃƒÂ¤hrenddessen blieb das ÃƒÂ¼brige Europa neutral, da es Frankreichs Angriff als unbegrÃƒÂ¼ndet ansah. Innerhalb weniger Wochen des SpÃƒÂ¤tsommers 1870 wurden die franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Armeen besiegt und NapolÃƒÂ©on III. gefangen genommen. Die Ã¢Â€ÂDritte RepublikÃ¢Â€Âœ, die sich daraufhin in Frankreich bildete, fÃƒÂ¼hrte den Krieg fort und fand sich erst im Februar 1871, nach dem Fall von Paris, zum Vorfrieden von Versailles bereit. Offiziell endete der Krieg am 10. Mai 1871 mit dem Frieden von Frankfurt, der hohe Reparationen sowie die Abtretung Elsass-Lothringens durch Frankreich vorsah., 82751=Am 18. Januar 1871 lieÃƒÂŸ sich WilhelmÃ‚Â I. auf Betreiben Bismarcks im Spiegelsaal des franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Schlosses zu Versailles nahe Paris zum deutschen Kaiser proklamieren. Diese Proklamation an diesem Ort wurde in Frankreich als DemÃƒÂ¼tigung empfunden. Am 10. Mai 1871 wurde im Frankfurter Hotel zum Schwan, nach langwierigen Verhandlungen in BrÃƒÂ¼ssel und Frankfurt, der Friede von Frankfurt geschlossen. Diesem vorausgegangen war der Vorfrieden von Versailles, der am 26. Februar 1871 unterzeichnet wurde., 96314=Auf den 1870/71er-Krieg folgte eine der lÃƒÂ¤ngsten Friedensphasen in Westeuropa, doch ein stabiler politischer Ausgleich zwischen dem Deutschen Reich und Frankreich wurde nicht erreicht. Mobilmachung und Kriegsbeginn 1914 emotionalisierten Deutsche (siehe Augusterlebnis) und Franzosen: die Deutschen wollten dem Ã¢Â€ÂErbfeindÃ¢Â€Âœ alle Ambitionen auf eine Ostexpansion dauerhaft austreiben, Frankreich motivierte das revanchistische Ziel, die Deutschen hinter den Rhein zurÃƒÂ¼ckzudrÃƒÂ¤ngen und die Ã¢Â€ÂSchmach von 1870/71Ã¢Â€Âœ wettzumachen.[21] Der Versailler VertragÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ sowohl seine Inhalte als auch die Art seines ZustandekommensÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ von 1919 war von franzÃƒÂ¶sischem RevanchebedÃƒÂ¼rfnis geprÃƒÂ¤gt und legte Grundlagen fÃƒÂ¼r die tiefgreifende Krise der jungen Weimarer Republik und den Aufstieg des Nationalsozialismus., 38940=Die jÃƒÂ¼ngst weitgehend geeinten Italiener hatten zwar erduldet, dass Savoyen von Frankreich annektiert wurde. Sie beanspruchten aber den Kirchenstaat um Rom herum. Frankreich trat allerdings als Schutzmacht des Papstes auf. Durch den Krieg 1870/71 ging diese Position verloren, sodass PreuÃƒÂŸen indirekt den Papst schwÃƒÂ¤chte (siehe Kulturkampf)., 37331=FranzÃƒÂ¶sische Minimalforderung aber waren (die zwischen 1797 und 1815 schon einmal franzÃƒÂ¶sisch besetzten) Teile des preuÃƒÂŸischen Saarlandes, deren Eroberung dem Sohn Napoleons III., NapolÃƒÂ©on EugÃƒÂ¨ne Louis Bonaparte (1856Ã¢Â€Â“1879), militÃƒÂ¤rischen Ruhm einbringen und dessen zukÃƒÂ¼nftige Position als Thronfolger festigen sollte. Ã¢Â€ÂOhne diesen Krieg wird Ihr Sohn nie herrschenÃ¢Â€Âœ, soll der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Marschall Patrice de Mac-Mahon (1808Ã¢Â€Â“1893) den Kaiser und die Kaiserin gedrÃƒÂ¤ngt haben. Auch der Zeitvorteil der franzÃƒÂ¶sischen stehenden Berufsarmee gegenÃƒÂ¼ber den Wehrpflichtigen-Armeen in Deutschland war geringer als erhofft., 88337=Frankreich verzichtete im Vorfrieden von Versailles auf grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸere, damals ÃƒÂ¼berwiegend deutsch- oder zweisprachig geprÃƒÂ¤gte Gebiete des Elsass und Lothringens. Sie wurden zum Reichsland ElsaÃƒÂŸ-Lothringen zusammen geschlossen, welches bis 1918 bestand. Diese territorialen VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen waren seit der franzÃƒÂ¶sischen KriegserklÃƒÂ¤rung (19. Juli 1870) von konservativen und liberalen Politikern und Journalisten in Deutschland gefordert worden. Die preuÃƒÂŸisch-deutsche FÃƒÂ¼hrung hielt sie vor allem aus militÃƒÂ¤rischen GrÃƒÂ¼nden fÃƒÂ¼r nÃƒÂ¼tzlich. Daneben spielten Fragen dynastischer Politik sowie das Interesse deutscher Industrieller am lothringischen Erz eine Rolle. In Deutschland lehnten lediglich die sozialistischen Abgeordneten im norddeutschen Reichstag und einzelne linksliberale Publizisten ÃƒÂ¶ffentlich die Annexionspolitik ab.[16] Die Haltung der sozialistischen Abgeordneten, die seit September 1870 jede neue Kriegskreditvorlage ablehnten (August Bebel und Wilhelm Liebknecht hatten sichÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ anders als die LassalleanerÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ bereits am 19. Juli enthalten), erregteÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ auch im AuslandÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ groÃƒÂŸes Aufsehen und trug erheblich zumÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ bis 1914Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ hohen internationalen Ansehen der deutschen Sozialdemokratie bei.[17] Bei der Grenzziehung spielten Sprachgrenzen keine Rolle, auch Gebiete mit franzÃƒÂ¶sischsprachiger BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung in Nordlothringen (mit Metz) wurden vom neuen Deutschen Reich verlangt. AuÃƒÂŸerdem musste Frankreich Reparationen in HÃƒÂ¶he von fÃƒÂ¼nf Milliarden Francs leisten.[18], 14970=Nach dem Deutsch-DÃƒÂ¤nischen und dem Deutschen Krieg von 1864 und 1866 gilt der Konflikt mit Frankreich als dritter und letzter der Deutschen Einigungskriege. Noch wÃƒÂ¤hrend seines Verlaufs traten Baden, Bayern, WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg und Hessen-Darmstadt dem Norddeutschen Bund bei, der sich mit Wirkung vom 1. Januar 1871 Deutsches Reich nannte. Der preuÃƒÂŸische KÃƒÂ¶nig Wilhelm I. nahm den Titel Ã¢Â€ÂDeutscher KaiserÃ¢Â€Âœ an, Otto von Bismarck wurde erster Reichskanzler. In Frankreich hatte der Krieg nicht nur die endgÃƒÂ¼ltige Abschaffung der Monarchie zur Folge. Vor allem der Verlust ElsaÃƒÂŸ-Lothringens erzeugte einen dauerhaften, gegen Deutschland gerichteten Revanchismus. In Deutschland wiederum verfestigte sich die Vorstellung von der so genannten Erbfeindschaft gegenÃƒÂ¼ber Frankreich. Beides belastete die deutsch-franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Beziehungen bis weit ins 20. Jahrhundert hinein., 64493=Im Gefecht bei Beaumont schlugen Teile der deutschen 3. und 4. Armee am 30. August ein Korps der Armee Mac Mahons, die sich nun auf Sedan zurÃƒÂ¼ckzog, wo sie am 1. September eine vernichtende Niederlage erlitt (vgl. Schlacht bei Sedan). Diese Niederlage fÃƒÂ¼hrte zwar zum politischen Zusammenbruch des franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Kaiserreiches, war aber unter rein militÃƒÂ¤rischen Gesichtspunkten nicht kriegsentscheidend.[9] Der Tag der Schlacht bei Sedan wurde spÃƒÂ¤ter im Kaiserreich bis 1918 als Sedantag gefeiert und mythisiert. Der Sieg bei Sedan wurde zum Symbol der ÃƒÂœberlegenheit ÃƒÂ¼ber den Erbfeind hochstilisiert., 71755=In Paris hatte die legislative Kammer unter dem Druck der Massen am 4. September 1870 die Dritte Republik proklamiert. Die neue Regierung der nationalen Verteidigung unter General TrochuÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ mit dem Innen- und Kriegsminister LÃƒÂ©on Gambetta als treibende KraftÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ hielt eine Fortsetzung des Krieges fÃƒÂ¼r mÃƒÂ¶glich, da Frankreich noch ÃƒÂ¼ber weit mehr als zwei Millionen wehrfÃƒÂ¤hige MÃƒÂ¤nner, betrÃƒÂ¤chtliche Mengen an Waffen und Munition, eine intakte RÃƒÂ¼stungsindustrie, offene SeehÃƒÂ¤fen und internationalen Kredit verfÃƒÂ¼gte. Zudem genoss die neue republikanische Regierung ein weit hÃƒÂ¶heres Ansehen als die gestÃƒÂ¼rzte kaiserliche, die die nationalistische Welle des Sommers 1870 nur sehr bedingt hatte ausnutzen kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Die Regierung forderte alle kampffÃƒÂ¤higen MÃƒÂ¤nner zum Eintritt in die Mobilgarde und die BevÃƒÂ¶lkerung der besetzten Gebiete zur Organisation von Franktireurabteilungen auf. Letztere begannen bald darauf, im rÃƒÂ¼ckwÃƒÂ¤rtigen Raum der deutschen Armeen kleinere Abteilungen und Posten, Kuriere und Trainfahrzeuge zu ÃƒÂ¼berfallen, lieferten sich aber auch offene Gefechte mit grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸeren deutschen VerbÃƒÂ¤nden.[11], 99281=Im Ã¢Â€ÂSanitÃƒÂ¤ts-Bericht ÃƒÂ¼ber die Deutschen Heere im Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870/71Ã¢Â€? werden folgende deutsche Verluste fÃƒÂ¼r den Zeitraum 16. Juli 1870 bis 30. Juni 1871 genannt (nur im Feld stehende Truppen):[22], 47118=Am 1. MÃƒÂ¤rz 1871 standen auf franzÃƒÂ¶sischem Boden 464.221 Mann Infanterie, 55.562 Reiter und 1.674 GeschÃƒÂ¼tze an Feldtruppen sowie 105.072 Mann Infanterie, 5.681 Reiter und 68 GeschÃƒÂ¼tze an Besatzungstruppen. Insgesamt wurden auf deutscher Seite im Kriegsverlauf etwa 1,4Ã‚Â Millionen Mann mobilisiert, von denen 1,1Ã‚Â Millionen in Frankreich zum Einsatz kamen., 69835=Durch die Kapitulation der ausweglos eingekreisten franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Truppen am 2. September war eine der beiden franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Hauptarmeen vernichtet worden. Auch NapolÃƒÂ©on III. gab sich bei Sedan gefangen; er wurde in den folgenden Monaten im Schloss WilhelmshÃƒÂ¶he festgehalten und ÃƒÂ¼bersiedelte im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 1871 nach London., 32573=Damit hatte Bismarck die franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Drohungen, das ungeduldige Vorgehen Benedettis und die Empfindsamkeiten der Franzosen geschickt ausgenutzt, auch indem er den Gang in die ÃƒÂ–ffentlichkeit der Diplomatie vorzog. Am 19. Juli 1870, nachdem schon zuvor die Mobilisierung angelaufen war, beugte sich NapoleonÃ‚Â III. dem Druck der ÃƒÂ–ffentlichkeit und seiner Umgebung und erklÃƒÂ¤rte PreuÃƒÂŸen den Krieg. Damit erfÃƒÂ¼llte die Depesche den von Bismarck beabsichtigten Zweck: Frankreich stand isoliert als Aggressor da, denn in den Augen der WeltÃƒÂ¶ffentlichkeit war der Kriegsanlass nichtig, und Frankreich hatte sich durch ÃƒÂ¼berhÃƒÂ¶hte Forderungen unnÃƒÂ¶tig in Zugzwang gebracht., 91990=In einem Brief vom 21. August 1870 an seinen Botschafter Albrecht von Bernstorff (1809Ã¢Â€Â“1873) in London begrÃƒÂ¼ndete Bismarck die deutsche Absicht zur Annexion von Elsass-Lothringen wie folgt:, 39460=GroÃƒÂŸbritannien war in der Frage gespalten: Trotz des Konfliktes mit PreuÃƒÂŸen um die Welfen-Enteignung und den Welfenfonds zeigte KÃƒÂ¶nigin Victoria Sympathie fÃƒÂ¼r die deutsche Seite, die britische Regierung indessen fÃƒÂ¼r den Rivalen Frankreich, den ehemaligen VerbÃƒÂ¼ndeten im Krimkrieg und im Mexiko-Abenteuer. So blieb GroÃƒÂŸbritannien neutral und lÃƒÂ¶ste die profranzÃƒÂ¶sische Welfenlegion auf, aber ebendiese britische NeutralitÃƒÂ¤t hielt nun auch DÃƒÂ¤nemark davon ab, mit Frankreich eine zweite Front zu erÃƒÂ¶ffnen. UrsprÃƒÂ¼ngliche franzÃƒÂ¶sische PlÃƒÂ¤ne einer Landung in Norddeutschland wurden daher aufgegeben. Die franzÃƒÂ¶sische Flotte blockierte dann stattdessen die deutsche NordseekÃƒÂ¼ste. Belgien, die Niederlande und Luxemburg hielt Bismarck aus dem Krieg, indem er ein Papier verÃƒÂ¶ffentlichte, in welchem Frankreich im Vorfeld des Krieges 1866 PlÃƒÂ¤ne zur Annexion des frankophonen Teils Belgiens niedergelegt hatte., 11781=Der Deutsch-FranzÃƒÂ¶sische Krieg von 1870 bis 1871 war eine militÃƒÂ¤rische Auseinandersetzung zwischen Frankreich einerseits und dem Norddeutschen Bund unter der FÃƒÂ¼hrung PreuÃƒÂŸens sowie den mit ihm verbÃƒÂ¼ndeten sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen Staaten Bayern, WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg, Baden und Hessen-Darmstadt andererseits., 84146=Am 18. MÃƒÂ¤rz 1871 versuchte der franzÃƒÂ¶sische Premierminister Adolphe Thiers, die verteidigungsbereite Nationalgarde von Paris (franz. Garde nationale) entwaffnen zu lassen. Dies fÃƒÂ¼hrte zu einem Aufstand. Am 26. MÃƒÂ¤rz 1871 ÃƒÂ¼bernahm in Paris eine Revolutionsregierung die Macht, die Commune de Paris. Die republikanische ÃƒÂœbergangsregierung wurde fÃƒÂ¼r abgesetzt erklÃƒÂ¤rt. Es kam zu einem der blutigsten BÃƒÂ¼rgerkriege in der neueren Geschichte. Erst im Mai 1871 gelang es den neu formierten bÃƒÂ¼rgerlichen Regierungstruppen, die bewaffneten Milizen der AufstÃƒÂ¤ndischen im StraÃƒÂŸenkampf zu schlagen. In der blutigen Woche vom 21. bis 28. Mai wurden ungefÃƒÂ¤hr 25.000 Menschen getÃƒÂ¶tet. Es folgten 38.000 Verhaftungen und 7.500 Deportationen., 95098=Die Eingliederung Deutsch-Lothringens und des alemannischen ElsaÃƒÂŸ als Reichsland ElsaÃƒÂŸ-Lothringen verschÃƒÂ¤rfte die sogenannte deutsch-franzÃƒÂ¶sische Erbfeindschaft. LÃƒÂ©on Gambetta, Staatsmann der Dritten Republik, formulierte die weitverbreiteten franzÃƒÂ¶sischen RevanchegelÃƒÂ¼ste am 16. November 1871 mit dem Satz: Ã¢Â€ÂY penser toujours, n'en parler jamais.Ã¢Â€Âœ (Ã¢Â€ÂImmer daran denken, niemals davon sprechenÃ¢Â€Âœ)., 97904=Mit dem Kriegsausbruch wurde in Rom das Erste Vatikanische Konzil abgebrochen. Die Diskussion zur Unfehlbarkeit des Papstes konnte deshalb nicht beendet werden. Damals befand Rom sich innerhalb eines eigenen Kirchenstaates, der bis dahin nicht zum 1861 gegrÃƒÂ¼ndeten KÃƒÂ¶nigreich Italien gehÃƒÂ¶rte. Die Franzosen hatten den Kirchenstaat lange beschÃƒÂ¼tzt, zogen ihre Truppen aber zur Verwendung in Frankreich ab. Daher konnte Italien fast ohne KÃƒÂ¤mpfe den Kirchenstaat erobern und am 20. September 1870 annektieren. Erst 1929 erlangte der fortan Vatikanstadt genannte und territorial extrem beschnittene Kirchenstaat wieder seine UnabhÃƒÂ¤ngigkeit., 54112=Der ursprÃƒÂ¼ngliche Plan der franzÃƒÂ¶sischen MilitÃƒÂ¤rfÃƒÂ¼hrung, der vorsah, mit der Hauptmacht ÃƒÂ¼ber die Pfalz ins Maintal vorzustoÃƒÂŸen, um so die sÃƒÂ¼ddeutschen von den norddeutschen Staaten zu trennen und ÃƒÂ–sterreich-Ungarn zum Kriegseintritt zu bewegen, erwies sich rasch als schon im Ansatz unausfÃƒÂ¼hrbar. Die Dislozierung der aufmarschierenden franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Truppen war jedoch ganz auf diese Offensivbewegung ausgerichtet, eine Offensive der preuÃƒÂŸisch-deutschen Truppen und das in diesem Fall erforderliche defensive ManÃƒÂ¶vrieren war nicht einkalkuliert worden.[7] Dieses Defizit, das organisatorische Durcheinander beim Aufmarsch bzw. bei der AusrÃƒÂ¼stung der VerbÃƒÂ¤nde und nicht zuletzt deren deutliche numerische UnterlegenheitÃ‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ zu Beginn der Operationen war die franzÃƒÂ¶sische Rheinarmee nur 210.000 Mann stark und damit mindestens im VerhÃƒÂ¤ltnis 1:2 unterlegen[8]Ã‚Â Ã¢Â€Â“ schrÃƒÂ¤nkten von vornherein die Aussicht auf eine erfolgreiche Abwehr eines deutschen Einfalls ein., 92406=Ã¢Â€ÂWir stehen heute im Felde gegen den 12. oder 15. ÃƒÂœberfall und Eroberungskrieg, den Frankreich seit 200 Jahren gegen Deutschland ausfÃƒÂ¼hrt. 1814 und 1815 suchte man BÃƒÂ¼rgschaften gegen Wiederholung dieser FriedensstÃƒÂ¶rungen in der schonenden Behandlung Frankreichs. Die Gefahr liegt aber in der unheilbaren Herrschsucht und AnmaÃƒÂŸung, welche dem franzÃƒÂ¶sischen Volkscharakter eigen ist und sich von jedem Herrscher des Landes zum Angriff auf friedliche Nachbarstaaten missbrauchen lÃƒÂ¤sst. [...] Wir kÃƒÂ¶nnen nicht immer auf eine auÃƒÂŸerordentliche Erhebung des Volkes rechnen und der Nation nicht ansinnen, stets das Opfer so starker RÃƒÂ¼stung zu tragen. Wenn die Entwaffnungstheorie in England ehrliche AnhÃƒÂ¤nger hat, so mÃƒÂ¼ssen dieselben wÃƒÂ¼nschen, dass die nÃƒÂ¤chsten Nachbarn Frankreichs gegen diesen alleinigen FriedensstÃƒÂ¶rer Europas mehr als bisher gesichert werden. Dass in den Franzosen dadurch eine Bitterkeit geweckt werde, kann dagegen nicht in Betracht kommen. Diese Bitterkeit wird ganz in demselben MaÃƒÂŸe stattfinden, wenn sie ohne Landabtretung aus dem Kriege herauskommen. Wir haben ÃƒÂ–sterreich, wesentlich aus jener RÃƒÂ¼cksicht, keine Gebietsabtretungen angesonnen, haben wir irgendeinen Dank davon gehabt? Schon unser Sieg bei Sadowa hat Bitterkeit in den Franzosen geweckt; wie viel mehr wird es unser Sieg ÃƒÂ¼ber sie selbst tun!

Wipers. SST."" And there's little arguing that Lovvers' aural blitzkrieg is built from the spare parts of the first decade of American punk rock, though it's the way they combine the sloppy and the furious that truly sets them apart. Comprised of Shaun Hencher on vocals, Henry Withers on guitar, Michael Drake on bass, and Stephen Rose on drums, Lovvers formed in Nottingham in 2006, and within two weeks of their first rehearsal the band had made their public debut. Seemingly willing to play anywhere at any time, Lovvers racked up over 200 gigs in their first two years, storming clubs in both the U.K. and Europe and opening for the likes of Times New Viking, the Black Lips, F****d Up, Foals, No Age, and the Butthole Surfers. After self-releasing their first recordings on CD-R, Lovvers found a like-minded record label in Jonson Family Records, who issued three 7"" Lovvers EPs in 2007. In time the group's growing reputation Ã¢Â€Â” rave reviews in the press peppered with provocative criticism, including a letter to the editor in venerable hard rock journal Kerrang! that described the band's live show as ""highly offensive"" Ã¢Â€Â” caught the attention of respected indie label Wichita Recordings, who released the seven-song 12""/CD Think in the fall of 2008.}",{43211=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2014 Apple Inc.

As a whole, the soft pianos and long string cues resonate like a chillier version of his excellent work on 1994's The Shawshank Redemption. His deep understanding of the human condition is evident during the dreamy ""Gun Cemetery."" With it's atonal piano notes falling like misled raindrops, it resembles an instrumental rendering of the image-laden ""9th and Hennepin"" off of Tom Waits' Rain Dogs album. The spooky solo trumpet on the atmospheric ""First Wife"" and ""Saeta"" closely mirrors the protagonist's lonely vigilantism, causing the sultry Rhodes-led groove on ""Glock Semi-Automatic"" to sound like an out of control freight train. Newman's mastery of the organic and the processed world of sounds has a great deal to do with his talent for seamlessness Ã¢Â€Â” the gritty backwards guitar loop that opens ""Palmdale Monty"" simply sounds like an instrument in the composers repertoire Ã¢Â€Â” and his otherworldly restraint. By refusing to fill the space between each breath, car chase, and gunfight, he unleashes a much more effective beast, a quiet and elegant bombast.

Everyone stares at me while I walk down the street, there's always a massive bulge in my pants, and I just want to scream ""LET'S JUST FALL IN LOOOVE"" in some dude's face cause I mean it. This album cured my depression and makes me feel like I've just been swarmed by 10 thousand puppies. Have you ever felt that way? You will now. BR All Day!! Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  Ã‚Â  by elove0207 I love the Bad Rabbits! I love their sound and style. You get a Michael Jackson dance vibe, with the soul of P-funk, and the edge of Deftones!

Dubbed Ladies' Love Oracle, the album was self-released the following year online; Phillips also sold it during his numerous appearances at Largo in Hollywood. After landing a new contract with Zoe/Rounder Ã¢Â€Â” and making the first of many appearances on the popular comedy-drama Gilmore Girls, as a roaming town troubadour Ã¢Â€Â” he issued the excellent Mobilize in 2001. The next year, Rounder reissued Ladies' Love Oracle in time for Phillips' joint tour with Kristin Hersh and Joe Doe. Virginia Creeper followed in 2004, marking the first time that Phillips had consciously eschewed all electric guitars in favor of a stripped-down, folksy sound. A covers album, Nineteeneighties, appeared in 2006, and Strangelet arrived one year later. For his next effort, Phillips assembled a band that featured Jay Bellerose, Paul Bryan, and Jamie Edwards, all of whom spent five days recording 2009's Little Moon., 27135=After spending his formative years in Stockton, CA, Grant-Lee Phillips headed to Los Angeles to study film. Finding himself beneath the spell cast by local bands like the Rain Parade and the Dream Syndicate, Phillips soon partnered with Stockton acquaintance Jeff Clark to form Shiva Burlesque. The band dissolved after two critically acclaimed records, and Phillips began writing and demoing under the Grant Lee Buffalo alias. Following several solo performances, he invited former bandmates Joey Peters and Paul Kimble to join him, and the trio signed to the Warner Bros subsidiary Slash Records in 1992.}","{52461=September 1, 1963 in Stockton, CA, 60628=Copyright Ã‚Â© 2014 Apple Inc.

There are 7.2m contacts/edges of 38k users/nodes. These have been drawn randomly ensuring a certain level of closedness. You are given 7,237,983 contacts/edges from a social network (social_train.zip). The first column is the outbound node and the second column is the inbound node. The ids have been encoded so that the users are anonymous. Ids reach from 1 to 1,133,547. There are 37,689 outbound nodes and 1,133,518 inbound nodes. Most outbound nodes are also inbound nodes so that the total number of unique nodes is 1,133,547. The way the contacts were sampled makes sure that the universe is roughly closed. Note that not every relationship is mutual. The test dataset contains 8,960 edges from 8,960 unique outbound nodes (social_test.csv). Of those 4,480 are true and 4,480 are false edges.

I kvalet fick de mÃƒÂ¶ta ÃƒÂ…tvidabergs FF och efter en seger med 1-0 hemma sÃƒÂ¥ rÃƒÂ¤ckte det med 1-1 borta pÃƒÂ¥ Kopparvallen fÃƒÂ¶r att MjÃƒÂ¤llby ÃƒÂ¥terigen skulle ta steget upp till Allsvenskan.[11], 124532=Senast uppdaterad 5 november 2014, 40909=Efter att tre ÃƒÂ¥r i rad varit nÃƒÂ¤ra att avancera till Allsvenskan var fÃƒÂ¶rvÃƒÂ¤ntningarna hÃƒÂ¶ga pÃƒÂ¥ klubben infÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songen 2002. De fÃƒÂ¶rvÃƒÂ¤ntningarna infriade inte laget alls och istÃƒÂ¤llet slutade MjÃƒÂ¤llby sÃƒÂ¤songen pÃƒÂ¥ sextonde och sista plats och fick se sig degraderade till division 2 igen.[21], 12328=MjÃƒÂ¤llby AllmÃƒÂ¤nna IdrottsfÃƒÂ¶rening, bildad 1 april 1939[1], ÃƒÂ¤r en fotbollssklubb frÃƒÂ¥n SÃƒÂ¶lvesborgs kommun med hemmaplan i byn HÃƒÂ¤llevik pÃƒÂ¥ Listerlandet i Blekinge lÃƒÂ¤n. HÃƒÂ¤llevik har bara 888 invÃƒÂ¥nare. SÃƒÂ¤songen 2010 ÃƒÂ¥terkom till MjÃƒÂ¤llby AIF till Allsvenskan efter att ha vunnit Superettan 2009. Klubbens hemmaarena heter Strandvallen och dess supporterklubb Sillastrybarna[2]., 42448=SÃƒÂ¤songen 2004 slutade laget ÃƒÂ¥terigen pÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶rsta plats i Division 2 SÃƒÂ¶dra GÃƒÂ¶taland och ÃƒÂ¥terigen var det efter en toppstrid mot ÃƒÂ„ngelholm. Denna gÃƒÂ¥ng stod Husqvarna FF fÃƒÂ¶r kvalmotstÃƒÂ¥ndet och efter segrar med 3-1 pÃƒÂ¥ bortaplan och 6-2 pÃƒÂ¥ hemmaplan var klubben tillbaka i Superettan.[23], 34347=1991 vinner de VÃƒÂ¥rtvÃƒÂ¥an och gÃƒÂ¥r upp till HÃƒÂ¶stettan dÃƒÂ¤r de blir kvar ÃƒÂ¤ven sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 1992, fÃƒÂ¶r att 1993 sluta sist i division 1 och ÃƒÂ¥ka ner i division 2.[16], 30757=SÃƒÂ¤songen 1985 lÃƒÂ¥g klubben, denna gÃƒÂ¥ng med Anders Linderoth som trÃƒÂ¤nare, ÃƒÂ¥terigen nere i de nedre delarna av tabellen och sÃƒÂ¥g lÃƒÂ¤nge ut att bli sÃƒÂ¤songens klara jumbo, men efter ett flertal starka segrar i bÃƒÂ¶rjan av hÃƒÂ¶sten sÃƒÂ¥g det ut som om klubben ÃƒÂ¤ndÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶r fÃƒÂ¶rsta gÃƒÂ¥ngen skulle klara av att sÃƒÂ¤kra ett nytt kontrakt. Men nÃƒÂ¤r de tappade ledningen frÃƒÂ¥n 3-1 till en fÃƒÂ¶rlust med 3-5 mot bottenkonkurrenten IFK NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping gick mycket av luften ur laget och de slutade pÃƒÂ¥ en elfte och nÃƒÂ¤st sista plats, tvÃƒÂ¥ poÃƒÂ¤ng bakom just IFK NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping. DÃƒÂ¤rmed var klubben ÃƒÂ¥terigen degraderad frÃƒÂ¥n Allsvenskan och det skulle senare visa sig drÃƒÂ¶ja 25 ÃƒÂ¥r innan klubben ÃƒÂ¥terigen var tillbaka dÃƒÂ¤r.[14], 29945=VÃƒÂ¤l tillbaka i division 2 sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 1984, slutade de pÃƒÂ¥ en andraplats ÃƒÂ¥tta poÃƒÂ¤ng bakom Trelleborgs FF och fick dÃƒÂ¥ kvala till Allsvenskan mot ÃƒÂ–rebro SK. De vann bÃƒÂ¥de hemma, med 1-0, och borta, med 3-0, och klubben blev dÃƒÂ¤rmed fÃƒÂ¶r tredje gÃƒÂ¥ngen pÃƒÂ¥ fem ÃƒÂ¥r klara fÃƒÂ¶r Allsvenskan.[13], 21256=SÃƒÂ¤songen 1975 vann klubben division 4 med god marginal fÃƒÂ¶re tvÃƒÂ¥an Ronneby BK och pÃƒÂ¥bÃƒÂ¶rjade dÃƒÂ¥ sin klÃƒÂ¤ttring upp genom seriesystemet.[5] Redan sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥ vann klubben division 3 och fick kvala till division 2. De vann sin kvalgrupp fÃƒÂ¶re IFK Ulricehamn, VÃƒÂ¤stra FrÃƒÂ¶lunda IF och IFK Ystad och blev dÃƒÂ¤rmed fÃƒÂ¶r fÃƒÂ¶rsta gÃƒÂ¥ngen i klubbens historia klara fÃƒÂ¶r division 2 sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥.[6], 19732=Den 28 juni 1953 invigdes klubbens nya idrottsplats Strandvallen pÃƒÂ¥ vilken de ÃƒÂ¤nnu spelar sina hemmamatcher. Invigningsmatchen var en uppvisningsmatch dÃƒÂ¤r klubben fÃƒÂ¶r fÃƒÂ¶rsta gÃƒÂ¥ngen mÃƒÂ¶tte ett utlÃƒÂ¤ndskt lag pÃƒÂ¥ hemmaplan nÃƒÂ¤r tyska Germania Leer kom pÃƒÂ¥ besÃƒÂ¶k. MAIF vann matchen med 4-1.[4], 36038=DÃƒÂ¤refter etablerade sig klubben som ett lag i division 1. 1999 var de endast tvÃƒÂ¥ poÃƒÂ¤ng ifrÃƒÂ¥n att knipa kvalplatsen till Allsvenskan frÃƒÂ¥n GAIS.[18], 22910=FÃƒÂ¶rsta sÃƒÂ¤songen i division 2 slutar MjÃƒÂ¤llby pÃƒÂ¥ en fjÃƒÂ¤rdeplats, 11 poÃƒÂ¤ng efter ÃƒÂ…tvidabergs FF pÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶rsta plats.[7] SÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 1978, slutade MjÃƒÂ¤llby ÃƒÂ¥terigen fyra, men den hÃƒÂ¤r gÃƒÂ¥ngen slutade de endast tre poÃƒÂ¤ng efter IS Halmia pÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶rstaplatsen.[8], 35229=FÃƒÂ¶rsta sÃƒÂ¤songen i division 2, 1994, undviker de nedflyttningskval tack vare bÃƒÂ¤ttre mÃƒÂ¥lskillnad och sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 1995, gÃƒÂ¥r de ÃƒÂ¥terigen upp till division 1 efter en klar seger i Division 2 SÃƒÂ¶dra GÃƒÂ¶taland.[17], 32742=Redan sÃƒÂ¤songen efter degraderingen frÃƒÂ¥n Allsvenskan, 1986, ÃƒÂ¤r klubben endast tre poÃƒÂ¤ng ifrÃƒÂ¥n att knipa den allsvenska platsen, men VÃƒÂ¤stra FrÃƒÂ¶lunda IF blev fÃƒÂ¶r svÃƒÂ¥ra. SÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 1987, slutade MjÃƒÂ¤llby pÃƒÂ¥ en ÃƒÂ¥ttondeplats i det nybildade division ett vilket ÃƒÂ¤r klubbens sÃƒÂ¤msta placering sedan de gick upp till division tvÃƒÂ¥ 1977. SÃƒÂ¤songen 1988 slutar laget pÃƒÂ¥ samma poÃƒÂ¤ng men med sÃƒÂ¤mre mÃƒÂ¥lskillnad ÃƒÂ¤n vinnarna Halmstads BK. Efter en sjÃƒÂ¤tteplats 1989 sÃƒÂ¥ ÃƒÂ¥ker klubben ur division 2 1990 efter att ha slutat pÃƒÂ¥ trettonde plats, endast en poÃƒÂ¤ng efter Landskrona BoIS.[15], 41551=SÃƒÂ¤songen 2003 slutade laget pÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶rsta plats i Division 2 SÃƒÂ¶dra GÃƒÂ¶taland efter en jÃƒÂ¤mn toppstrid mot ÃƒÂ„ngelholms FF dÃƒÂ¤r mÃƒÂ¥lskillnad till slut fick avgÃƒÂ¶ra. I kvalet till Superettan fick de mÃƒÂ¶ta GAIS, vilka blev fÃƒÂ¶r svÃƒÂ¥ra. GAIS vann bÃƒÂ¥da matcherna och MjÃƒÂ¤llby fick spela ytterligare en sÃƒÂ¤song i division 2.[22], 27839=Den andra sÃƒÂ¤songen i Allsvenskan, 1983, bÃƒÂ¶rjade mycket bÃƒÂ¤ttre ÃƒÂ¤n den fÃƒÂ¶rsta och efter den tredje omgÃƒÂ¥ngen lÃƒÂ¥g MjÃƒÂ¤llby till och med etta i Allsvenskan. Den placeringen tappade de dock redan i den fjÃƒÂ¤rde omgÃƒÂ¥ngen efter fÃƒÂ¶rlust mot IF Elfsborg. ÃƒÂ„ven om laget ÃƒÂ¥kte pÃƒÂ¥ ett par stÃƒÂ¶rre fÃƒÂ¶rluster under sÃƒÂ¤songen sÃƒÂ¥som 0-6 hemma mot AIK och 4-1 borta mot ÃƒÂ–rgryte IS sÃƒÂ¥ sÃƒÂ¥g klubben lÃƒÂ¤nge ut att klara sig kvar. InfÃƒÂ¶r den sista omgÃƒÂ¥ngen lÃƒÂ¥g klubben pÃƒÂ¥ tionde plats, precis ovanfÃƒÂ¶r nedflyttningstrecket, med endast en poÃƒÂ¤ng ner till Gefle IF och BK HÃƒÂ¤cken som bÃƒÂ¥da lÃƒÂ¥g under strecket. MjÃƒÂ¤llby mÃƒÂ¶tte i sista omgÃƒÂ¥ngen tvÃƒÂ¥an MalmÃƒÂ¶ FF pÃƒÂ¥ Strandvallen samtidigt som Gefle tog emot IFK GÃƒÂ¶teborg och HÃƒÂ¤cken spelade borta mot IF Elfsborg. MjÃƒÂ¤llby tog ledningen mot MalmÃƒÂ¶ FF och sÃƒÂ¥g ÃƒÂ¤nda in i det lÃƒÂ¤ngsta ut att vinna, men med 46 sekunder kvar av matchen kvitterade MalmÃƒÂ¶ och eftersom Gefle, som vann sin match och dÃƒÂ¤rmed slutade pÃƒÂ¥ samma poÃƒÂ¤ng som MjÃƒÂ¤llby, hade klart bÃƒÂ¤ttre mÃƒÂ¥lskillnad sÃƒÂ¥ ÃƒÂ¥kte MjÃƒÂ¤llby ur Allsvenskan.[12], 45123=Strandvallen ÃƒÂ¤r en fotbollsarena i HÃƒÂ¤llevik pÃƒÂ¥ Listerlandet i SÃƒÂ¶lvesborgs kommun, vÃƒÂ¤stra Blekinge och ÃƒÂ¤r hemmaplan fÃƒÂ¶r MjÃƒÂ¤llby AIF. Strandvallen stod klar 1953 och dess kapacitet ÃƒÂ¤r 7Ã‚Â 000 och har 2Ã‚Â 800 sittplatser. Publikrekordet ÃƒÂ¤r 8Ã‚Â 438 mot Kalmar FF, ett rekord som sattes pÃƒÂ¥ arenans premiÃƒÂ¤rmatch 1980, klubbens fÃƒÂ¶rsta allsvenska match. Till sÃƒÂ¤songen 2010, med utÃƒÂ¶kning infÃƒÂ¶r 2012, byggdes pÃƒÂ¥ norra kortsidan en ny lÃƒÂ¤ktare med 1600 nya sittplatser, samtliga under tak. Kapaciteten begrÃƒÂ¤nsades av Svenska FotbollfÃƒÂ¶rbundet frÃƒÂ¥n 7500 till 7000 innan sÃƒÂ¤songen 2010 bÃƒÂ¶rjade., 37277=InfÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songen 2000 slogs de tvÃƒÂ¥ division 1-serierna ihop till Superettan och MjÃƒÂ¤llby var tack vare sin tredjeplats sÃƒÂ¤songen innan kvalificerade fÃƒÂ¶r denna fÃƒÂ¶rsta sÃƒÂ¤song med Superettan. Trots lÃƒÂ¥ga fÃƒÂ¶rvÃƒÂ¤ntningar infÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songen, bland annat hade Christian Wilhelmsson och Marcus Ekenberg flyttat frÃƒÂ¥n klubben infÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songen, ÃƒÂ¥ngar MjÃƒÂ¤llby pÃƒÂ¥ och har infÃƒÂ¶r sista omgÃƒÂ¥ngen mÃƒÂ¶jligheten att nÃƒÂ¥ tredjeplatsen som innebÃƒÂ¤r kval till Allsvenskan. Samtidigt som MjÃƒÂ¤llby var tvingade att vinna borta mot EnkÃƒÂ¶pings SK sÃƒÂ¥ fick inte Landskrona BoIS vinna borta mot Kalmar FF fÃƒÂ¶r att MjÃƒÂ¤llby skulle kunna knipa tredjeplatsen. MjÃƒÂ¤llby vann sin match med hela 6-1 samtidigt som Kalmar vann med 2-1 och kvalplatsen till Allsvenskan var dÃƒÂ¤rmed sÃƒÂ¤krad. I kvalet fick MjÃƒÂ¤llby mÃƒÂ¶ta BK HÃƒÂ¤cken och efter att de hade vunnit med 3-2 hemma pÃƒÂ¥ Strandvallen infÃƒÂ¶r hela 7 400 ÃƒÂ¥skÃƒÂ¥dare sÃƒÂ¥ hade de ett gyllene lÃƒÂ¤ge att ta sig tillbaka upp till Allsvenskan igen. Borta pÃƒÂ¥ Rambergsvallen slutar dock matchen 3-2 till HÃƒÂ¤cken efter full tid och efter att inget lag gjort nÃƒÂ¥got mÃƒÂ¥l under tillÃƒÂ¤ggstiden gick det till straffar dÃƒÂ¤r HÃƒÂ¤cken vann strafflÃƒÂ¤ggningen med 3-2 och MjÃƒÂ¤llby fick fortsÃƒÂ¤tta ÃƒÂ¤ven nÃƒÂ¤sta sÃƒÂ¤song i Superettan.[19], 18607=Klubben bildades den 1 april 1939 genom en sammanslagning av de bÃƒÂ¥da klubbarna Listers IF och HÃƒÂ¤lleviks IF. Klubben spelade i de lÃƒÂ¤gre divisionerna i Blekinge och pendlade mellan division 5 och division 3. Sin bÃƒÂ¤sta sÃƒÂ¤song under de hÃƒÂ¤r ÃƒÂ¥ren hade klubben sÃƒÂ¤songen 1942/43 dÃƒÂ¥ de slutade sexa i division 3. SÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥ fÃƒÂ¶ll de dock ner tillbaka till division 4.[3], 43238=DÃƒÂ¤refter etablerade sig klubben som ett lag i Superettan mellan 2005 och 2008., 25244=SÃƒÂ¤songen 1980 debuterade sÃƒÂ¥ MjÃƒÂ¤llby AIF i Allsvenskan, men premiÃƒÂ¤ren blev inte som klubben hade tÃƒÂ¤nkt sig. ÃƒÂ„ven om hela 8 438 ÃƒÂ¥skÃƒÂ¥dare kom (ÃƒÂ¤n idag publikrekordet pÃƒÂ¥ Strandvallen) till matchen mot Kalmar FF sÃƒÂ¥ skadade sig lagets viktiga danske anfallare Flemming Pehrson efter endast 11 minuters spel och matchen fÃƒÂ¶rlorades med 0-1. Den fÃƒÂ¶rlusten fÃƒÂ¶ljdes av fler. PÃƒÂ¥ sommaren hyrde klubben in den engelske proffsspelaren Frank Worthington frÃƒÂ¥n Birmingham City FC som endast hann med att spela 10 matcher och gÃƒÂ¶ra 4 mÃƒÂ¥l fÃƒÂ¶r klubben innan han stack tillbaka till England. Laget slutade till sist pÃƒÂ¥ sista plats med 11 ihopspelade poÃƒÂ¤ng, tio poÃƒÂ¤ng ifrÃƒÂ¥n DjurgÃƒÂ¥rdens IF ovanfÃƒÂ¶r nedflyttningsstrecket.[10], 95569=FÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songsÃƒÂ¶vergÃƒÂ¥ngar, se ÃƒÂ¶vergÃƒÂ¥ngar vintern 2014/2015., 142815=StÃƒÂ¶rsta seger 11-1 mot Markaryds IF 1992, 39522=InfÃƒÂ¶r sÃƒÂ¤songen dÃƒÂ¤rpÃƒÂ¥, 2001, sÃƒÂ¥gs klubben som favorit till att vinna hela Superettan och efter en riktigt stark vÃƒÂ¥rsÃƒÂ¤song sÃƒÂ¥g det ut att kunna bli pÃƒÂ¥ det viset. Sedan kom hÃƒÂ¶stsÃƒÂ¤songen och laget kom in i en lÃƒÂ¤ngre svacka, men i sista omgÃƒÂ¥ngen sÃƒÂ¤krade laget tredjeplatsen efter seger mot ÃƒÂ–sters IF och fick dÃƒÂ¤rmed fÃƒÂ¶r andra ÃƒÂ¥ret i rad kvala till Allsvenskan. Den hÃƒÂ¤r gÃƒÂ¥ngen stod IFK NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping fÃƒÂ¶r motstÃƒÂ¥ndet. FÃƒÂ¶rsta matchen spelades pÃƒÂ¥ ett blÃƒÂ¥sigt Strandvallen och resulterade i en seger fÃƒÂ¶r MjÃƒÂ¤llby med 2-1. Den andra matchen borta mot NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping blev en rysare sedan NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping en bit in i andra halvleken har dragit ifrÃƒÂ¥n till 3-1 och MjÃƒÂ¤llby med fem minuter kvar fick en misstÃƒÂ¤nkt straffsituation bortdÃƒÂ¶md. Matchen slutade 3-1 till NorrkÃƒÂ¶ping och MjÃƒÂ¤llby blev kvar i Superettan.[20], 43454=SÃƒÂ¤songen 2009 ÃƒÂ¥ngar MjÃƒÂ¤llby pÃƒÂ¥ genom hela sÃƒÂ¤songen tills de slutligen stod som slutsegrare med hela 14 poÃƒÂ¤ngs marginal ner till trean Assyriska FF.[24] Det innebar att MjÃƒÂ¤llby AIF var tillbaka i Allsvenskan 2010 fÃƒÂ¶r fÃƒÂ¶rsta gÃƒÂ¥ngen pÃƒÂ¥ 24 sÃƒÂ¤songer. Detta trots att klubben under sommaren fÃƒÂ¶rlorade sin anfallare Erton Fejzullahu till den hollÃƒÂ¤ndska klubben NEC Nijmegen., 142880=StÃƒÂ¶rsta fÃƒÂ¶rlust 0-6 mot AIK 1980 samt mot BK HÃƒÂ¤cken 2011, 23893=Den tredje sÃƒÂ¤songen i division 2, 1979 lyckades MjÃƒÂ¤llby med fem poÃƒÂ¤ngs marginal ner till tvÃƒÂ¥an Helsingborgs IF vinna division tvÃƒÂ¥ sÃƒÂ¶dra och blev dÃƒÂ¤rmed klara fÃƒÂ¶r Allsvenskan sÃƒÂ¤songen 1980.[9]}","Tue, 30 Jun 2015 14:23:45 GMT"

The other two entries are read by KDevelop and are used mainly for user convenience. If a ShowFileAfterGeneration key entry is present, the specified file is opened after the project is created. The Category serves to better divide templates in a tree view for selection. It can contain any number of levels, separated by slashes, but it is recommended to always use two levers for consistency. CMake macro Keeping source code in compressed archives is an inconvenience, both for version control systems and for users when trying to edit these templates.

The OEM LG replacement filter has been tested and certified to meet NSF Standard 42, meaning it has been certified to reduce chlorine levels in your water. The aftermarket Swift Green replacement is made from an eco-friendly process and is a cheaper, more affordable alternative to the OEM. The Supco replacement filter is our lowest priced option. DonÃ¯Â¿Â½t let the price fool you, though. The Supco is a great alternative to the OEM as it purifies your water for a fraction of the price of the OEM. Each of the different models all have the same flow rate and share very similar features. The primary difference between the filter brands is price and NSF rating, though many filters that are not NSF certified are still constructed from NSF rated parts.

For a car that had a rather odious beginning as a peopleÃ¢Â€Â™s car commissioned by Adolf Hitler, the Beetle came to be loved by multiple generations of basic transportation seekers on every continent with the possible exception of Antarctica. Originally promised to pre-war Germans who saved the requisite amount of Reichsmarks, it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t until after the war that a Beetle was delivered to a private customer. Beetles of the 1950s and 1960s were marked by evolutionary rather than wholesale changes. A minor increase in horsepower and displacement and several different rear window designs (a small split window, a small oval window and a larger window) was about it through 1967. The 1960 Ã¢Â€ÂœThink SmallÃ¢Â€? advertising campaign is still studied in marketing classes around the world. Throughout most of its life in the U.S., the Beetle was offered in sedan and cabriolet body styles.

The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference.

The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber.

The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber.

The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber.

The regulations update OSHA's general industry and construction signage standards by adding references to the latest American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards on specifications for accident prevention signs and tags., 6844=On April 11, 2014 (79 FR 20316), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published a final rule: Revising the general industry standards for electric power generation, transmission, and distribution work and for electrical protective equipment; revising the construction standard for electric power transmission and distribution work; and adopting a new construction standard for electrical protective equipment. The final rule updated those standards and made the general industry and construction standards consistent. This document corrects errors in the preamble and regulatory text of the final rule., 37469=On June 13, 2013, OSHA published in the Federal Register (78 FR 35559) a direct final rule that revised its signage standards for general industry and construction by updating the references to national consensus standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a clearinghouse that verifies that the criteria for approval of consensus standards have been met. OSHA stated in that Federal Register notice that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the direct final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. Since OSHA received no such significant adverse comments, the Agency now confirms that the direct final rule became effective as a final rule on September 11, 2013., 54631=OSHA is extending the comment period on the Request for Information on Chemical Management and Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) to October 9, 2015., 44417=Ã‚Â§ 1801, 46015=Title 29 published on 2013-07-01, 45058=114 Stat. 1901, 42826=Ã‚Â§ 1911, 46105=The following are ALL rules, proposed rules, and notices (chronologically) published in the Federal Register relating to 29 CFR Part 1910 after this date., 42724=Ã‚Â§ 1904 - Authorization of appropriations, 16176=On November 20, 2013, OSHA published in the Federal Register a direct final rule that revised records contained in the Mechanical Power Press Standard. OSHA stated in that document that it would withdraw the companion proposed rule and confirm the effective date of the final rule if the Agency received no significant adverse comments on the direct final rule or the proposal. Since OSHA received no such significant adverse comments on the direct final rule or the proposal, the Agency now confirms that the direct final rule became effective as a final rule on February 18, 2013., 20948=OSHA last issued rules for the construction of transmission and distribution installations in 1972. Those provisions are now out of date and inconsistent with the more recently promulgated general industry standard covering the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution lines and equipment. OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment. The existing construction standard for the design of electrical protective equipment, which applies only to electric power transmission and distribution work, adopts several national consensus standards by reference. The new standard for electrical protective equipment, which matches the corresponding general industry standard, applies to all construction work and replaces the incorporation of out-of-date consensus standards with a set of performance-oriented requirements that is consistent with the latest revisions of the relevant consensus standards. The final construction rule also includes new requirements for the safe use and care of electrical protective equipment to complement the equipment design provisions. Both the general industry and construction standards for electrical protective equipment will include new requirements for equipment made of materials other than rubber. OSHA is also revising the general industry standard for foot protection. This standard applies to employers performing work on electric power generation, transmission, and distribution installations, as well as employers in other industries. The final rule removes the requirement for employees to wear protective footwear as protection against electric shock.}","Tue, 21 Jul 2015 16:40:05 GMT"

"[['PROFITABILITY RATIOS:', 'Net Sales to Gross Sales NET SALES TO GROSS SALESNET SALES TO GROSS SALES shows the percent of all transactions that may be considered as ""good"" net transactions. Differences may arise from returns, bad product, or other sales concessions.', 'Gross Profit Margin on Sales GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON SALES (GPM) is one of the key performance indicators. The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels. Generally: >40% = Indicates a sustainable competitive advantage < 40% = Indicates competition may be eroding margins < 20% = There is likely no sustainable competitive advantage Formula: Gross Profit / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (Pre-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax)NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM Pre-Tax) incorporates all of the expenses associated with ordinary business (excluding taxes) thus is a measure of the overall operating efficiency of the firm prior to any tax considerations which may mask performance. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Formula: Net Earnings / Net Revenue', 'Net Profit Margin (After-tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) NET PROFIT MARGIN (NPM After Tax) measures profitability as a percentage of revenues after consideration of all revenue and expense, including interest expenses, non-operating items, and income taxes. For a business to be viable in the long term profits must be generated; making the net profit margin ratio one of the key performance indicators for any business. It is important to analyze the ratio over time. A variation in the ratio from year-to-year may be due to abnormal conditions or expenses which need to be addressed. A decline in the ratio over time may indicate a margin squeeze suggesting that productivity improvements may need to be initiated. In some cases, the costs of such improvements may lead to a further drop in the ratio or even losses before increased profitability is achieved. Generally, if the NPM history is >20% annually, it is an indicator that the firm enjoys a sustainable competitive advantage. If the average NPM is <10%, it usually indicates that the firm is in a highly competitive business. Formula: Net Profit After Tax (EAT + DII + OI) / Net Revenue', 'Operating Expense to Sales OPERATING EXPENSE TO SALESOPERATING EXPENSE TO SALES reports the operating expenses as a percent of Net Revenues. This then is a measure of the total overhead employed in the firm per Net Sales Revenue Dollar; thereby giving an indication of the efficiency of the cost structure of the company. It gives an indication of the ability of a business to convert income into profit. Generally, businesses with low ratios will generate more profit than others. In general business operations with larger and more stable cash flows can sustain higher ratios than smaller and less stable operations. Scale and income stability are important considerations though it is up to the management of a business to monitor costs in an appropriate manner whatever its size. Formula: Total Overhead Cash Expense / Net Revenues', 'Operating Profit to Sales OPERATING PROFIT TO SALESOPERATING PROFIT TO SALES is a useful ratio when evaluating value of a firm. It discounts the effect of varying tax rates and benefits to give a more accurate indication of the return associated with the firm. Operating Profit (EBITDA) / Net Revenues.', 'Basic Earning Power BASIC EARNINGS POWERBASIC EARNINGS POWER (BEP) is useful for comparing firms in different tax situations and with different degrees of financial leverage. This ratio is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of operations. Basic Earning Power measures the basic profitability of Assets because it excludes consideration of interest and tax. This ratio should be examined in conjunction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint potential problems regarding asset management. Formula: EBIT / Total Assets', 'Return on Assets (After-tax) RETURN ON ASSETS RETURN ON ASSETS (ROA) shows the after tax earnings of assets. Return on assets is an indicator of how profitable a company is. Use this ratio annually to compare a business performance to the industry norms: The higher the ratio the greater the return on assets. However this has to be balanced against such factors as risk, sustainability and reinvestment in the business through development costs. Higher ROA is better, but extremely high ROA may be an indicator of vulnerability as to any sustainable competitive advantage. Formula: Earnings After Tax (EAITDA) / Total Assets', 'Return on Equity RETURN ON EQUITYRETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) measures the overall efficiency of the firm in managing its total investments in assets and in generating a return to stockholders. It is the primary measure of how well management is running the company. ROE allows you to quickly gauge whether a company is a value creator or a cash consumer.

Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages.

The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital.

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.
