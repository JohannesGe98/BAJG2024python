The only issue I've had with it has been that I had a little trouble with my freshman interview. The lady that interviewed me seemed to be extremely impatient with the fact that I hadn't decided on a major yet, and rushed through my interview, making me feel like I didn't get the most help I could have. Other than that, like I said, it is a very friendly school. Am learning a lot I'm very impressed with the way the professors are so willing to help students. I have had several instances in classes where I have not understood the material given, and I'm pleased to say that I have felt totally comfortable in going to my professors and asking them to explain things. One professor in particular stayed after class with me for an hour and a half! They all seem to be very professional and knowledgable.

There are tons of outdoor oriented groups (if that's your thing) that are always looking for new members, but there are lots of other groups to join as well.

The only issue I've had with it has been that I had a little trouble with my freshman interview. The lady that interviewed me seemed to be extremely impatient with the fact that I hadn't decided on a major yet, and rushed through my interview, making me feel like I didn't get the most help I could have. Other than that, like I said, it is a very friendly school. Am learning a lot I'm very impressed with the way the professors are so willing to help students. I have had several instances in classes where I have not understood the material given, and I'm pleased to say that I have felt totally comfortable in going to my professors and asking them to explain things. One professor in particular stayed after class with me for an hour and a half! They all seem to be very professional and knowledgable.

Tips for prospective students It would be a brilliant idea to look at the clubs and organizations offered at the University of Utah. There are tons of outdoor oriented groups (if that's your thing) that are always looking for new members, but there are lots of other groups to join as well. Also be sure to check out the dorms at the U (and apply for on campus housing as soon as you can... it fills up quickly) because they are really nice (you don't have to share a bathroom with your entire floor), plus you can meet a lot of people.

The only issue I've had with it has been that I had a little trouble with my freshman interview. The lady that interviewed me seemed to be extremely impatient with the fact that I hadn't decided on a major yet, and rushed through my interview, making me feel like I didn't get the most help I could have. Other than that, like I said, it is a very friendly school. Am learning a lot I'm very impressed with the way the professors are so willing to help students. I have had several instances in classes where I have not understood the material given, and I'm pleased to say that I have felt totally comfortable in going to my professors and asking them to explain things. One professor in particular stayed after class with me for an hour and a half! They all seem to be very professional and knowledgable.

Larger national tours are also coming through Salt Lake all the time at venues like The Complex, In the Venue, and The Depot which are all fantastic. Also check out the Twilight Concert Series for the first few weeks of fall semester. If you like shopping, there's two malls that are easy to access through Trax. City Creek is our newest and is both outdoor and indoor; it's a little more upscale. Gateway is the other and is on the opposite side of town but is still tons of fun! It's also right next to the music venues I mentioned above. There are farmers markets usually at the beginning of the fall semester and end of spring."", ""The dining hall always has a variety of food available. However, it does get repetitive after eating it for eight months. The staff is super nice, though! There's also some great places to eat in the student union and there are small little snack stores scattered in buildings all over campus and in the library. Plus, the block right below President's Circle is filled with incredible restaurants, like the student and city favorite, The Pie Pizzaria. Also, the U Pharmacy has an awesome little cafe in the back with half off milkshakes on Tuesdays. Another favorite is Village Inn, which is about half a mile off campus and is accessible by Trax, gives free pie on Wednesdays until 10 PM."", 'Dorm life is so much fun!

Make study groups or take classes with an SI indication and then actually go. They're incredibly helpful, especially your freshman year when you're still trying to adjust to college. If you live on campus, don't be afraid to go to the dining hall alone. Also, be sure to try the sugar cookies. Your class syllabus is your best friend. Become friends with the librarians at the Marriott Library. They become incredibly helpful when you have a research paper and don't know how to use all of the library's resources. Go to your professor's office hours and ask them questions. It will help you with the class and the teacher will get to know you on a more personal level, which is nice if you ever need recommendation letters."", ""The University of Utah is an awesome place to go to college!

The only issue I've had with it has been that I had a little trouble with my freshman interview. The lady that interviewed me seemed to be extremely impatient with the fact that I hadn't decided on a major yet, and rushed through my interview, making me feel like I didn't get the most help I could have. Other than that, like I said, it is a very friendly school. Am learning a lot I'm very impressed with the way the professors are so willing to help students. I have had several instances in classes where I have not understood the material given, and I'm pleased to say that I have felt totally comfortable in going to my professors and asking them to explain things. One professor in particular stayed after class with me for an hour and a half! They all seem to be very professional and knowledgable.

Also, as a student I get tons of free resources such as the gym/field-house use, FREE public transportation services, and academic resources such as career services (clean up your resume) or the writing center (edit a paper). Plus on top of that the U is always giving out freebies at events and discounts to restaurants and such. As a college kid free is my favorite word and the U understand that., 206576=it is a fairly diverse college with students from all over the world. it also has a good reputation in being a research university and is in the pac12. not to forget also that it has good professors, one recent one had won the 2007 nobel prize., 392750=I didn't stay in the dorms, however, I did have friends that did. I was up at the dorms quite a bit. The dorms were built for the 2000 Olympic guests and it shows. Unlike most dorms where four people share one bathroom the dorms here are spacious and have two separate bathrooms. Because the dorms were built in 2000 they are newer and pretty clean. My friends really loved being in the dorms., 892831=Dorm life is so much fun! RHA is the on-campus resident association and they constantly have things going on, like movie nights, ice cream socials, and last year we even held our own Hunger Games!

The Olympics were here in Salt Lake back in 2002 so dormitories were built for the Olympians which are now used by students., 926448=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 296813=The dorms on the University of Utah's campus are extremely nice considering they were built to house the participants of the 2002 Olympics. There is plenty of space for both your roommate and you., 242795=There's pretty much a club for everyone. and if you can't find one, you can get six random people together and start your own! Personally, I joined the marching band because they get to perform at all the football games, including bowl games! It's amazing feeling when a huuuge crowd of people cheer as you march onto the field!, 54518=The school is generally well priced, especially for in-state tuition. Housing is a bit pricey but the buildings were all just re-done for the athletes competing in the 2002 olympics. The personal rooms are spacious and the closets are pretty big, every floor has a laundry room and some kind of hang-out or study room.}",,"07/29/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 29 out of 31 people found this review useful. 1 of 222 Katie from Sandy, UT Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Often the second-test passing rates of students who flunk a test initially are lower than their class's overall passing rate, since they are the class's weakest students. So if those second-test results were combined with the first test results in the usual way, it would likely lower the overall percentage and make the school look worse than otherwise.

Up until this year (2005), if they passed the third grade test, then they were included in the numerator only of the calculation to determine the third grade passing score.

According to the Boston Globe (March 1, 2006), ""Alleging that their pregnancies had been marred by fraud, 16 women have filed a class-action lawsuit against a Lowell laboratory that promises to determine the gender of an embryo by testing the mother's blood just five weeks after conception. In the suit filed in US District Court in Boston, the women charged that despite its claim of 99.9 percent accuracy, Acu-Gen Biolab of Lowell got the genders of their babies wrong, causing confusion and distress, and then refused to make good on its double-your-money-back guarantee.""}",,"We then played all 9 rounds. In each round we recalculated the expected amount in our briefcase and recorded the banker's offer but refused it. Here are the results: In order to see if the banker's offers get better as we pick more briefcases, we played a second game in which we refused all the banker's offers. With this strategy we started with an expected winning given by the average of the initial amounts, which we found to be $131,478. Our six choices eliminated the amounts 1, 50, 75, 300, 400,000, 500,000. The expected value of our briefcase was now the average of the amounts in the remaining briefcases. Making this calculation we found that this is $125,900 (rounded to the nearest dollar). The banker offered us $29,854 to quit. So we would have to have been pretty risk adverse to accept the banker's offer at this point. We did this, playing the only the first round. We chose number 13 for our briefcase. We were then asked to choose six briefcases. We chose briefcases 3,10,12,13,19, 25. Here is the result of this round: The best way to understand the game is to play it here on the NBC website. So the banker is always trying to buy out the player. If he fails, the player will end","We note that the banker's offer at each round was less than the expected amount in our briefcase. While it seemed clear at the beginning we would be right to refuse the offer, as we get nearer the end this is not so obvious. For example, after the 8th round the only amounts available were $400, $25,000, and $1,000,000. We were offered $317,700, a pretty nice amount of money. If we rejected it we would have a 2/3 chance of ending up with a relatively small amount and a 1/3 chance of getting the million dollars. We might well be sufficiently risk averse at this point to accept the offer. However, we didn't and the briefcase we chose had the $400. Now the only amounts left were $25,000 and $1,000,000. We were now offered $367,500. Again we might have thought twice about refusing this. But we did refuse it and we opened the last briefcase, which had the million dollars, So our briefcase had $25,000. If you watch the TV program you will find that most contestants refuse the banker's offers in the early rounds but accept it in one of the later rounds. âDeal or No Dealâ? was introduced in Australia in 2003 and currently airs in 38 countries including the U.K. Those who feel that Excel is slow to fix its statistical errors will be amused by the Wikipedia account (See Predictable Sequence Controversy) of what happened to the UK âDeal",False,-1,0,

Many statistics textbooks treat the subject of data manipulation but this one provides an entirely new slant on exploitation of voting systems and how the procedures have been employed in the United States and elsewhere on the globe.}",,"1. Statisticians are quick to despair over the lack of statistical literacy on the part of the lay public but rarely concern themselves with their own lack of historical literacy. On page 65 can be found this surprising table regarding the presidential election of 1860: Discussion Go here to see short videos of him discussing the general ideas of his book. Kenneth Arrowâs Impossibility Theorem here dryly âsays that if the decision-making body has at least two members and at least three options to decide among, then it is impossible to design a social welfare function that satisfies all these conditions [Arrowâs axioms] at once.â? In loose, lay terms, ""No voting method is fair"", ""Every ranked voting method is flawed"", or ""The only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship."" Poundstone brings the theorem to life with examples using Condorcetâs method and Bordaâs method while giving the reader the background of disdain between the two 18th century French aristocrats. âInstant runoffâ? and âapproval votingâ? are also discussed at length and found wanting but for different reasons. Poundstone devotes later pages to range voting as a democratic, practical way of avoiding Arrow; in fact, range voting is already used when it comes to rating restaurants, athletes, Utube videos, and a host of other activities but never thus far in political elections. William Poundstone is a wonderful writer. A previous book of his, Fortuneâs Formula, was reviewed","What percentage of Chance News readers and contributors knew that Breckinridge and Bell each received more electoral votes than Douglas? What percentage of Chance News readers and contributors knew that Breckinridge and Bell together received a larger popular vote than Douglas? Does anyone know the first names of Breckinridge and Bell? We read here that âAt least five U.S. presidential elections have been won by the second most popular candidate. The reason was a âspoilerââa minor candidate who takes enough votes away from the most popular candidate to tip the election to someone else. The spoiler effect is more than a glitch.â? What where those five elections? 2. Facing off two at a time is known as Condorcet voting because of its 18th century advocate, Marquis de Condorcet, Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet, and makes perfect sense as in: if A is taller than B and B is taller than C, then A is taller than C. Unfortunately, while the concept of âtaller thanâ? always has this property of transitivity, âpreferable toâ? often lacks transitivity and can thus, lead to the so-called Condorcet cycle. Find some common examples in life where transitivity is violated. 3. There is also the problem of the irrelevant alternative, an excellent example of which is found on page 50. When faced with the choice of apple pie vs. blueberry pie only, the customer chooses apple. However, moments later the waiter comes back and says cherry",False,-1,0,
