¯Vê«˜öJ[$πJX¡ÛF*Ugn-@âòœ3Îsÿˆ2010, The Washington Post released an article asking if college was too easy because current students are studying less than previous generations. George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus.

If you are lucky for a cheap school look else where. Everything has gotten extremely expensive.

With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need.

George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason?

If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round.

Am enjoying being here I am very much enjoying being at Mason. But in order for it to be fun, you have to be social and get involved in the Mason community events and organizations! Plus, it's very accessible to Washington, D.C. Am learning a lot I get excited about what I have learned when I leave my classes. I am a psychology major and psychology is very interesting within itself, but I have been able to explore my major in ways to help me decide what I want to do after I get my degree. I feel that I will be well prepared to go out into the work force when I graduate because of the knowledge and great teaching abilities of my professors.

GMU also offers free bus transit on Fairfax City CUE buses and has free shuttles to various places such as the Vienna Metro stop and the local malls so you can easily get around the city.

If you are lucky for a cheap school look else where. Everything has gotten extremely expensive.

I project for annual tuition to be about $35,000 by 2017 with they way things are looking., 377232=It was definitely convenient to be on campus because it's very difficult to find a decent parking spot on a Tuesday or Thursday unless you come before 9:30 am.

The Johnson Center, or the JC, is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and grab a bite to eat, finish up assignments, or get all your textbooks and Mason gear from the bookstore. The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way. And these activities aren't like lame programming because it's run by students. We pick high-profile celebrities for our school concerts and have real fun things to do at events. We've had Kendrick Lamar, Andy Grammar, etc. We've also had ziplining if you're into that. The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does.

George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit.

Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day.

I love how Mason is so close to DC because of the fact that I grew up 15 minutes from DC myself in Maryland.', ""Mason has a variety of foods around campus, especially in the Johnson Center. The foods aren't bad but they aren't good either, I honestly wish that there were more healthy foods around campus. Pizza and fries and get pretty old after a while. My favorite place to dine at Mason has to be Southside. Southside has home cooked-ish meals that they cook and serve everyday. It also says open 20 hours a day I believe."", 'I absolutely LOVE being an on campus student here at Mason! My floor mates and my RA are all like family to me! Living on campus is always more convenient being that I am an out-of-state student. Before being an on campus student I would commute to school everyday from Maryland, which was very tedious. Now that I am on campus I am able to join clubs and organizations andy overall I just feel more involved in school.', ""So far, academics here at Mason are very lenient when it comes to work and teachers know and LOVE what they're doing! I have yet to have any issues with any of my professors and getting in touch with them is very easy; they're approachable!"", ""Do not get distracted from your school work. Mason has many activities going on around campus almost everyday, and to know when to study and when to have fun is very important! Also, make sure you stay on top of your student account because I have dealt with issues with student accounts and financial aid because I didn't constantly check on my account."", 'Mason is known for its large and diverse college population; this happens to be one of my favorite qualities about the school! Not only are the academics outstanding, having a social life at Mason is also easy being that there are so many student events and activities!

There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds.

There is so much to choose from at Mason. All of the organizations make themselves well-known with lots of events and lots of ways to help you academically. Also, ask for help when you need it. There are many resources for help with papers, exams or even if you just don't understand the material being taught to you. One of the best types of resources provided is Blackboard where you can chat with your professors and classmates and pretty much any time of the day! And many professors provide extra notes on Blackboard =) Bang for the buck It's a little pricey if you are an out-of-state student, but it's worth the money for your experiences that you gain!

George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension.

What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00.

Lecture halls are usually semi-big but then they are divided into Labs where you are able to get one on one assistance with your instructors. I learned so much within my first semester there and was well prepared entering my second semester. My professors were compromising and taught me new ways to study, write papers and do presentations. My strengths were brought out and my so called weaknesses are no longer categorized as such! I am a nursing major but I have been introduced to all other majors and everyone seems to know a little about everything which is great given that the school is big and yet feels like a spacious home.

The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way.

The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does.

George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round.

Am enjoying being here I am very much enjoying being at Mason. But in order for it to be fun, you have to be social and get involved in the Mason community events and organizations! Plus, it's very accessible to Washington, D.C. Am learning a lot I get excited about what I have learned when I leave my classes. I am a psychology major and psychology is very interesting within itself, but I have been able to explore my major in ways to help me decide what I want to do after I get my degree.

There is so much to choose from at Mason. All of the organizations make themselves well-known with lots of events and lots of ways to help you academically. Also, ask for help when you need it. There are many resources for help with papers, exams or even if you just don't understand the material being taught to you. One of the best types of resources provided is Blackboard where you can chat with your professors and classmates and pretty much any time of the day!

The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way.

The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does.

George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus. Mason offers shuttles there on weekdays and weekends to the closest metro station which then takes you to D.C. and there are thousands of adventures you can have in D.C. Different organizations around campus also offer a lot of events and you don√É¬É√Ç¬¢√É¬Ç?√É¬Ç?t necessarily have to be a member of their organization because they are open to everyone., 607908=I have been to George Mason multiple times since deciding I would like to enroll here next August, and the Mason Staff has been nothing but kind to me.

I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension.

Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day.

There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days.

For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here.

I love my family and my friends at home but I just feel like GMU is my home. It's hard not to consider it as so because I love my girls especially given that we are so different in ethnicities, backgrounds and races and yet completely have each other's backs! Am learning a lot Here at George Mason University a.k.a GMU or Mason, classes are small and the professors are shockingly always available to answer questions by email or in person. Lecture halls are usually semi-big but then they are divided into Labs where you are able to get one on one assistance with your instructors. I learned so much within my first semester there and was well prepared entering my second semester. My professors were compromising and taught me new ways to study, write papers and do presentations. My strengths were brought out and my so called weaknesses are no longer categorized as such! I am a nursing major but I have been introduced to all other majors and everyone seems to know a little about everything which is great given that the school is big and yet feels like a spacious home.

I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session.

I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit.

There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here.

Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus.

But violence on campus does happen like it does at any other school across the nation. Nowhere is 100% safe and that is a shame, but there are police on campus as well as cadets that can escort you to your car if you're alone at night. I have had a tense moment where I felt unsafe in the parking lot; a guy that looked like an average blonde and preppy college student was standing around, texting at 9 pm, and he looked up and stared at me as I walked by. There was one other person in the parking lot and once they drove away he followed me to my car and came up to my passenger window. I didn't look up at him and drove away as fast as possible. Regretfully, I did not call to report his suspicious behavior but am hoping he did not frighten anyone else that night, but in 3 years on campus that is the only incident I have ever had where I felt unsafe.

One of the best types of resources provided is Blackboard where you can chat with your professors and classmates and pretty much any time of the day! And many professors provide extra notes on Blackboard =) Bang for the buck It's a little pricey if you are an out-of-state student, but it's worth the money for your experiences that you gain!

I learned so much within my first semester there and was well prepared entering my second semester. My professors were compromising and taught me new ways to study, write papers and do presentations. My strengths were brought out and my so called weaknesses are no longer categorized as such!

If you are lucky for a cheap school look else where. Everything has gotten extremely expensive. Just within a year of being here, they have increased meal plan, tuition, unnecessary fees, and dorms are also ridiculously expensive.

The upperclassmen dorms are nice, but Presidents Park(freshman housing) is pretty bad. Overall I had fun in the dorms and I liked my RAs and roommates, but it's very expensive., 22787=Mason, as it is most commonly referred to, is a great environment and portrays a vibrant campus. The Johnson Center, or the JC, is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and grab a bite to eat, finish up assignments, or get all your textbooks and Mason gear from the bookstore. The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way. And these activities aren't like lame programming because it's run by students. We pick high-profile celebrities for our school concerts and have real fun things to do at events. We've had Kendrick Lamar, Andy Grammar, etc. We've also had ziplining if you're into that. The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does. Tuition, at this point of 2011, is expected to increase 12% over the next two years., 990910=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 881295=In 2010, The Washington Post released an article asking if college was too easy because current students are studying less than previous generations. George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus. Mason offers shuttles there on weekdays and weekends to the closest metro station which then takes you to D.C. and there are thousands of adventures you can have in D.C. Different organizations around campus also offer a lot of events and you don√É¬É√Ç¬¢√É¬Ç?√É¬Ç?t necessarily have to be a member of their organization because they are open to everyone., 607908=I have been to George Mason multiple times since deciding I would like to enroll here next August, and the Mason Staff has been nothing but kind to me.

There are many resources for help with papers, exams or even if you just don't understand the material being taught to you. One of the best types of resources provided is Blackboard where you can chat with your professors and classmates and pretty much any time of the day! And many professors provide extra notes on Blackboard =) Bang for the buck It's a little pricey if you are an out-of-state student, but it's worth the money for your experiences that you gain!

I feel safe walking on campus during the day and night because there are always people walking around and most places are lit up at night. Mason also offers police escorts at night for students who feel uncomfortable walking on campus at night. As far as drinking on campus dorms, Mason is pretty strict but many students find ways to still do it. So, it is often to see police and ambulance on a school night pull up to dorm buildings. So, Mason can definitely improve and do something about that. For the most part, with good decisions and good judgement you will definitely feel safe!', 'Mason has a wide variety of clubs. Sororities/Fraternities, cultural clubs, religious clubs, dance clubs, you name it! With whatever interests, I am sure you will find an activity you like!', ""The Mason Statue! I love that guy. I don't know a single student who hasn't taken a picture with the Mason Statue yet. The statue has a plate in front of it. Tradition is if you step on the plate, you won't graduate on time. So watch out! Also, I love the water. I find myself going to the Mason Pond a lot especially in the Spring/Summer time because it's simply beautiful! The whole campus gets really pretty in the Spring and Summer because of it's greenery."", ""Mason is really pricey for an out of state student! There is a HUGE different in what instate and out of state students pay. So I'm sure I will be in debt by the time I graduate. However, there are SO many opportunities at Mason! They have Masters and even Ph.D degrees in many fields so your experience at Mason is definitely worth it! Mason also has a lot of great professors who really care about students and try to make learning as fun as possible. So it's definitely worth the buck. I can't imagine myself being anywhere else besides Mason! I have decided to stay at Mason for both undergrad and graduate because I love it so much!"", ""Like I said before clubs and activities are worth joining at Mason. I find myself going to the mini movie theater in the Johnson Center from time to time. Other than that, there's nothing more you can do. There are places and restaurants near campus to go to and of course D.C. is just a few minutes away!"", ""Food and dining are OKAY at Mason. In the JC, everyone talks about Hotspot which has different meals everyday. They also have taco bell and chik-fil-a in Sub I. A dining place called southside is like an all you can eat restaurant which is a good place as well. They have Starbucks, Subway, and a new Pizza Place! Mason's dining options are definitely improving"", ""It really depends on where you live. I spent freshman housing in the Commons. It wasn't so bad as people before me described it. Living in a double square room was quite small but cozy at the same time. The people on my floor were always out chatting away in the common room throughout the day which gave in to the cozy family like feel. So, you will automatically have a social family at Mason as a freshman! However, the noise may interfere with work, but you always can make a trip to the library or study halls which can be open pretty late. Also, in freshman housing, the restrooms had two stalls and two showers which were maintained by friendly janitors everyday which I loved. Now that I am an upper class student. Upper class housing is definitely more spacious and more quiet. At least in my experience. So, I loved it as well!"", 'Mason is pretty strict with the honor code.', ""In order to get the full experience of Mason, try to join as many clubs and activities as you can. Also, if you are an out of state student, this will give you something to do because the majority of Mason students are commuters. So, during the weekends, students living on campus have nothing to do, so being involved in activities would be great. Also, some students don't like the fact that we don't have a football game. Fortunately, I'm not a fan of sports so this didn't really bother me, but if you are a football fan this may upset you."", 'George Mason is so diverse, if you walk anywhere on campus or the Johnson Center which is the hot spot for students to purchase foods and hangout, you will hear so many difference languages of different nationalities! The campus is beautiful ,encompassed with both architectural buildings and lots of greenery, including many trees in certain areas and a pond! There are also many opportunities for students on campus and its located near D.C. to make access to opportunities even better.

Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason?

If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term.

There are many varsity and club sports teams, as well as types of clubs from experience-centered like event planing and business clubs to entertainment-centered like dancing or movie clubs.', 'George Mason University is great for students looking for a diverse community and city-like environment.', 'A tradition we have on campus is the superstition that if you step on the school plaque in front of the George Mason statue, then you will not graduate on time. So be careful!', ""George Mason University is fairly expensive to in-state students and even more expensive for out-of-state students. Since GMU is located in a wealthy county, prices are high and you may find that you need to penny pinch when it comes to creating a budget. I find a great way to save money is to rent books and to utilize the free shuttle bus system. Furthermore, students are admitted free to any of the school's sports games."", 'Unfortunately, food is average quality at George Mason University. The food is not outstanding nor is it terrible but instead, a definite in-between. However, there are plenty of restaurants and diners surrounding the campus that offer many delicious options.', 'Dorm life is great at George Mason University and living in a dorm is the number one way to meet new people. I am a senior now at GMU and I am still friends with many of my freshman dorm hall-mates. Freshman dorms may be small but the atmosphere is friendly and there is a strong feeling of unity and community. Upperclassmen dorms are generally more spacious and offer more utility options like half or full kitchens and a living room area.', 'Academics is very important at George Mason University. The school takes education seriously and a majority of professors expect a lot from their students. If you attend this school, you need to be aware that you are solely responsible for your education.', 'The most important skill to develop and cultivate is time management. George Mason University has a lot of activities and events happening both on and off campus. This excitement can be distracting to those who do not know how to manage their time, since it seems like there is always something fun to do on campus. It is important to make a schedule and stick to it by setting time aside to study and to have fun. Another important tip is to talk to your professors. Freshman classes are typically larger than other grade classes, which means it is very easy to get lost or settle into the crowd. It is important to introduce and talk to your professor to help you stand out from others. If your professor can put your face to your name, then they are more likely to help you with assignments, extend deadlines, and write better references.', 'George Mason University is a big school with over 30,000 enrolled students. However, this intimidating number does not mean that you cannot find your own little home on campus.

Quite a few students, however, choose not to become involved in Greek Life at all. I would say it is not as popular at Mason as it might be elsewhere.', 'Computer, Science, and Math students; those interested in cultural diversity (our campus is one of the most diverse in the country); those interested in an internship or future job in the government/DC area.', ""Do not step on the plaque on either side of the George Mason Statue, which is located in the center of campus.

The Statue is a symbol of Mason Pride and will be an important landmark for you to know."", ""Mason is cheap, and it's academic program is amazing.

There are dozens of Club sports, including soccer, volleyball, swimming, running, basketball, baseball, and crew. Intramural sports include soccer, futsal, volleyball, and flag football. They have short seasons and are for those who want to play without too much commitment to a Club team. There are three gyms on campus, one of which has two swimming pools. There are plenty of clubs, including Ballroom, Belly-dance, Arab Culture and German Language. There are sports game going on frequently, which are free to students -- you can even get free dinner! A lot of the school's offices have fun events throughout the week. There are films shown every weekend in the campus cinema. D.C. is an excellent place for a night out on the town, and Mason runs a shuttle constantly to the metro station. The town of Fairfax is pretty large, too, with plenty of shopping places."", ""Dining on campus, though expensive, is excellent. There are dozens of options, including Subway, Panda Express, Chick-fil-A, and Einstein Bros. Bagels. Most on-campus students have a meal-plan, and eat at either Southside or Ike's, the excellent all-you-can-eat dining hall.

But this ensures that your grade truly reflects the amount of effort you put in, and will ultimately be to your advantage. You will be encouraged to engage in a lot of academic work outside the classroom, such as research projects, which you should definitely take advantage of.', ""Mason is often seen as a Science school, but it has excellent Arts and Humanities programs as well. Still, high-level math and science courses in high school are highly valued and will give you a big advantage. Apply for the Honors College, which is an excellent opportunity most incoming students don't take advantage of. If you plan to go into a Humanities program, work hard in language courses. Mason offers placement testing that will allow you to skip lower level foreign language classes. Also, take AP and other courses with transferable credit, as Mason accepts a lot of credits from incoming freshman."", 'Mason is a culturally diverse state college just outside Washington D.C.

If you are lucky for a cheap school look else where. Everything has gotten extremely expensive.

I project for annual tuition to be about $35,000 by 2017 with they way things are looking., 377232=It was definitely convenient to be on campus because it's very difficult to find a decent parking spot on a Tuesday or Thursday unless you come before 9:30 am.

Overall I had fun in the dorms and I liked my RAs and roommates, but it's very expensive., 22787=Mason, as it is most commonly referred to, is a great environment and portrays a vibrant campus. The Johnson Center, or the JC, is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and grab a bite to eat, finish up assignments, or get all your textbooks and Mason gear from the bookstore. The community of this campus welcomes anybody who chooses to come to school here. As Mason continues to grow and expand, you get to become part of a growing spectacle. With new dorms the campus houses nearly 5,000 students. New gyms, facilities, and the Southside: all you care to eat buffet make Mason a place where you have everything you need. The Mason Inn that will be opening in the summer of 2010 gives Mason another great addition to the growing legacy here., 669186=Student-orgs are always on the move and always working with the campus in some type of way. And these activities aren't like lame programming because it's run by students. We pick high-profile celebrities for our school concerts and have real fun things to do at events. We've had Kendrick Lamar, Andy Grammar, etc. We've also had ziplining if you're into that. The school works with other companies and restaurants to provide us with a lot of fun stuff to do, so it's literally never dull., 164479=This is my only issue with Mason. While I think I'm getting a great education, as an out of state student I pay close to three times what an in state student does. Tuition, at this point of 2011, is expected to increase 12% over the next two years., 990910=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 881295=In 2010, The Washington Post released an article asking if college was too easy because current students are studying less than previous generations. George Mason plays a big role in the article, and even though this was four years ago I believe it still applies. I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here. I am glad to be transferring out next semester due to tuition problems to Washington State University. For the money its better to go to a school people know of instead of hearing, George Mason? Never heard of it... what state is it in?, 37983=Spend a lot of time researching how much money you'll be getting, FAFSA offers about $1800 a year Pell Grant and $2750 subsidized loans which means that you will need a private loan. If you come from a low income family make sure you have a strong co-signer otherwise you will be stuck having no way to pay for college and GMU will place a hold on your account eventually leading them to report you to a collection agency. Study hard if you decide to go here and don't spend too much of your time sleeping in. Go to lectures because if you don't you will regret it at mid-term. Do your best to make friends because that's how you survive the next 4 years., 785090=George Mason offers a multitude of events for its students year-round. The Patriots Activities Council is an organization that allows students to plan events for students to enjoy. For example, last spring Kendrick Lamar performed and this fall Aziz Ansari hosted a comedy show at Mason. George Mason's proximity to the D.C. area is an amazing plus. Mason offers shuttles there on weekdays and weekends to the closest metro station which then takes you to D.C. and there are thousands of adventures you can have in D.C. Different organizations around campus also offer a lot of events and you don√É¬É√Ç¬¢√É¬Ç?√É¬Ç?t necessarily have to be a member of their organization because they are open to everyone., 607908=I have been to George Mason multiple times since deciding I would like to enroll here next August, and the Mason Staff has been nothing but kind to me.

I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day.

Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here.

Their omelettes are awesome I'd say, with quite a few options for toppings. Is known for its desserts and ice cream machine (especially the ice cream! :D :) ) The Global Center (The Globe as many say) has awesome food- it was fitted for students and was previously a hotel. Variety is there; food is multinational options. The quality of the food is amazing! Ike's is pretty good, and in some ways, better than SSide, particularly for its pizza, at least that's what I have been told... Anyways, they just finished constructing and it's definitely bigger than SSide's sq. footage. Lots of room, but their ice cream got busted by some random kid, so no ice cream, but they do have some decent desserts. There's also Pilot House, which I can say with accuracy is the go-to place if you want greasy food. Not too diverse with food options and not too big either. If you have a meal plan, the JC has some good places to get food. La Pat' is a decent place (haven't gone there enough times to really know the quality of the food there)."", ""Hopefully you get a good/decent roommate, but even if you don't, it's alright, you don't have to become close friends with your roommate.

I see lots of people studying, but I also see lots of people bemoaning about having to study instead of studying. Despite this, most exams that I, as a biology major, have seen seem to be more about memorization than actual comprehension. Most students get old exams and burn the questions and answers into their memory, hoping to see them again in the morning after an all-night cram session. I do not think these people are truly learning; challenge yourself to understand the concepts of your coursework., 143438=The only major downside of this is the change of Meal Plans that was implemented in the beginning of the Fall 2014. Fortunately, I am able to keep my current meal plan because I'm a sophomore. However, anyone enrolled during 2014-2015 and beyond are required to have the Anytime Meal Plan. What sucks about it is that they can only use it in the 3 main dining halls on-campus: Southside, The Globe, and Ike's. These students will also be stuck with the meal plan (unless they live off-campus). In contrast, I have a 175 Flex Semester Plan and I'm able to use my Meal Plan other than the main dining halls. For example, I can use it in the food court of the Johnson Center, Chic-Fil-A, and Subway. Also, if upperclassmen decide to switch to the Anytime Meal Plan, they cannot switch back or to another. Another thing about the Meal Plans are that the money doesn't roll over to the next semester. For future students, this will be the bonus funds. Bonus funds always come with the Meal Plan and can be used whenever. Each student receives at least $100 for the semester. The purpose of them is to use them as an alternative to the meal plan. Usually, a meal swipe to get into the dining halls equals $7.00. For me, I use bonus funds for food that cost less than or greater than $7.00. There are occasions where I use both my meal swipes and bonus funds to pay for food, but that√É¬¢??s when I start running out of bonus funds. So, it√É¬¢??s important to use the bonus funds wisely because you can run out of them very quickly (I learned the hard way). The food at GMU is not the best, but they do switch it up every day. Sometimes it tastes great, but sometimes it doesn't-- it depends on your specific taste criteria and also the location where you get the food., 39870=In truth this campus gets really boring at nights and weekends, many would say because it lacks a football team and many would argue that this school just has no spirit. Frats are off campus and only a few ever join one since they are expensive and at times selective or time consuming. Most students here are commuters who you never see around campus. There are many clubs, but other than that there isn't for a student to do around here. People mostly keep to themselves and the dorms are fairly quiet most days. You hear people brag about the 2006 Basketball Finals all the time so much that it gets tiring. If you are a student who are seeking a quiet and anti-social education come here, but if you want to have fun in college and remember the 4 years for the rest of your life then by all means don't go here.

The area is mostly upper-class suburban, with a shopping district that caters to students nearby...not exactly a dangerous neighborhood. Additionally, the police department is literally two blocks away, and its average response time is about 5 minutes. Crime is not common.', ""I won't bother to list all of the different clubs Whittier has to offer. It takes up several pages in the freshman manual, anyway. Suffice to say that we have societies (the equivalent of a fraternity or sorority). We have many varied clubs, from pure entertainment to sports-related to major-related. If you want a club and it's not offered, you can easily start it."", ""Quiet students, first and foremost, do very well at Whittier. If you simply want a calm place to learn and grow, the campus can fit your needs nicely without much difficulty (livelier students don't generally have any problems either, of course, but that's true on most campuses; not so with quiet students). Whether or not you like to party, you'll find that Whittier can meet your needs. There are parties which can get very upbeat and slightly rowdy, but never to the point that students who don't frequent such events are likely to feel uncomfortable. Most importantly, students who want to know the people around them do well here. You WILL know your professors, you WILL know your classmates, and they WILL know you. There's very little avoiding that. It's a close, tight-knit environment, and the students who are willing to embrace that are the happiest."", ""Whittier is expensive. Close to $50,000 dollars with expenses included. Offsetting that is a generous pool of financial aid money, but you are likely to end up paying in the thousands of dollars regardless. Whittier has many opportunities and amenities, but it is a small school, and doesn't offer everything that a larger university can. On the other hand, you will get a much more personal education. Your professors will know your name, and will be better able to guide you towards personal understanding. They also happen to write fantastic letters of recommendation. On balance, Whittier costs a lot, but what you pay for is worth it: you get real understanding, rather than just a degree given by a distracted administration to faceless students. (In case you were wondering, you get the degree, too)."", 'The college itself sponsors many different events. There are seasonal festivals that may include anything from carnival attractions to bouncy houses. There are musical groups and influential speakers who are frequently (think weekly or even more commonly) called to come to campus and entertain or educate students. There are clubs and activities aplenty (see Clubs and Activities below). Facilities include a gym, a pool, and several sports fields, all of which are available for student use. The surrounding city of Uptown Whittier has what amounts to a small shopping district just a couple blocks from the campus. Included are a theater, a book shop, a candy shop, multiple restaurants, and several clubs and bars (oftentimes, but not always, having taken a rather bohemian style as a reflection of the clientele).', ""The main source of on-campus meals is the Campus Inn, or CI. The CI has unlimited food, free soft serve, and vegetarian options. It is not gourmet cuisine. It is usually decent, and gets to be pretty good if there's an event going. Students who find they can't handle CI food constantly can buy flexible meal packages which include options at The Spot, which sells traditional American foods such as chili dogs and bacon burgers. Off-campus, there are fast food restaurants such as Subway and In-N-Out within easy distance, as well as traditional restaurants, which are somewhat pricey (perhaps $10 for a meal) but serve superior food."", 'The dorms are small. The dorms are expensive. As with most colleges, the dorms are not especially comfortable, feature communal bathrooms, and can occasionally be louder than they should. On the plus side, the communal areas where people normally make noise are not directly adjacent to the rooms. Dorm buildings are split by class, so upperclassmen have nicer dorms and fewer antics which they must endure. All of the dorms are also fairly clean, and usually in good repair.', ""Most of your professors will be doctors in their fields. They know what they're talking about, and nothing they teach you will be especially challenging for them. That means that, as a general rule, they expect you to learn quickly. For some students, that's not a problem, and the quick pace is often enjoyable. For others, study groups or tutoring may be called for. Luckily, the professors are also very helpful and willing to help struggling students outside of class. The campus has a tutoring center and can offer you skilled tutors free of charge."", ""1. Don't ditch class. Your professors will notice. Even if it's a lecture hall class, they will notice. Many classes have an attendance policy. If you can't be bothered to show up, you may suffer academically. 2. Have fun...reasonably. If you burn yourself out partying your first year, the rest of your college experience may be unpleasant. If you don't go out at all, you may suffocate in boredom. Find that happy medium, and enjoy your college experience. 3. Do your best to get to know your classmates and professors. There aren't really enough people for you to easily get lost in the crowd, so if you don't reach out, or if you rebuff friendly attempts at socialization, you may find that you've isolated yourself without meaning to do so. Life will be easier and more enjoyable if you cultivate positive relations. 4. Get involved. Join clubs. Try out for a sport. Volunteer. You'll meet new people (see the above statement for how not to be a social pariah), have unique experiences, and make great friends. It's the difference between having a fantastic college life and having four more years of high school."", ""Whittier has a wonderful campus community, varied (free) resources, generous financial aid funding, and a body of professors who genuinely care about their students. The only potential drawback is that it's also very small; you will know most of the other students by your third or fourth year.

The rooms are much larger than typical college dorms and the Residential Life staff is amazing. Dorm life, especially as a freshman, is the best way to make friends and get involved on campus. Upper-classman housing is also very nice.', 'Academics at Whittier are what you make of them. Classes are not very difficult, however they can be academically challenging. Whittier is not a school where you can get by with doing nothing and because of the small classes it is practically impossible to skip class. As in all schools you will have both good and bad teachers. Thankfully I have experienced more good than bad. One thing that students who will be attending Whittier should be aware of is that the academics are very focused on developing writing skills. Personally, I do not enjoy writing essays, so when I found this out I was a bit nervous. However, teachers plan very well so that students are not procrastinating on essays and the grading system is much easier than I expected. The best part is that many teachers allow rewrites, so if you fail to impress the first time, you can get their feedback and try again.', 'If you are a prosepctive student my first piece of advice is to find as much financial aid as possible. Whittier as an amazing school, however, the cost of attendence is quite a burden. The good news is that the school offers a whole lot of financial aid, but still it is smart to apply for as many scholarships and outside money as possible. Another piece of advice is that for living options, especially as a freshman, the best place is on campus. Commuters are not as involved in the college life as those who live on campus. My last piece of advice is that, if you can, try and join a sport. The athletic program is a very close group of amazing people. Joining a sport is your best bet at making a good group of friends and helps with getting involved on campus. Societys are also a good option for those who are not into athletics.', 'Whittier College is great for a student who is looking for a small school with a closely knit student body.

Some of the areas that lack are the food and dinging because we should be able to eat great tasting food at least on a normal basis. Another area that lacks is room and board because we have no air conditioning in two of the dorms which presents a problem with Southern California weather.', 'There are a lot of events here on campus and outside of campus that you can be apart of in order to have a lot of fun and to relive some of your school stresses.', 'The food and dinging here is poor especially if you are an athlete. It is difficult to find food here where you can get enough good tasting protein in your body for your upcoming athletic events. The staff that works in the food and dining area are polite and courteous but the food is not a strong suite here.', 'Dorm life here is great because everyone is so close to each other because there is less than 3,000 students here which is smaller than my high school. The main issue with dorm life is that two of the dorm halls do not have air conditioning which does cause tensions between students during the hotter months of the year. People here try to include everyone as much as possible because we are one big community living together.', 'The academic rigor of Whittier College is extremely high. From academics to intellectual thinking this college is the place to be in order to challenge your brain. This school also challenges you by requiring you to take and have success in the required liberal arts course on top of course for your major and minor.', 'If you are looking for a college with high academic standards and a challenging work place this is the college for your. Always stay organized and keep a planner because the course list will only you help you so much.

If you think Amen Corner and the Sarazen Bridge are impressive on TV, you should see how they look in real life. Augusta National is consistently ranked as the #1 golf course in the United States, and it provides a remarkable challenge for the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs best golfers. And although there have been some low scores posted over the last couple of years, it was only a few years ago that the winning score was +1, proving again how difficult the course really is. If you want to be there, GoTickets can make that happen with Masters golf tournament tickets. While you are probably never going to become a member of Augusta National Golf Club or be lucky enough to play a round of 18 holes at one of the finest courses in the world, you can be among the few to have Masters golf tournament tickets. Unlike some other tournaments, Augusta National strictly limits the number of Masters tournament tickets that are available each year to prevent overcrowding. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs great news for everyone in attendance, but it also means that Masters tickets are perhaps the toughest of all golf tickets.

For a while it looked like Woods and Mickelson were the only two golfers with a chance to win the iconic green jacket as they won five times combined over a period of six years. Mickelson, who for years was the best golfer to have never won a Major, has now earned a victory at Augusta three times, and Tiger is in search of his fifth title.

But black parents were far more likely than other parents to strongly disagree with the statement that their children's chances of admission were hurt. The results suggest parents may be aware of one of the points made by defenders of affirmative action: that most students get into the colleges they apply to, and that there are only a small proportion of colleges with highly competitive admissions for anyone. Given the political significance of the debate, Inside Higher Ed asked parents whether they believed that affirmative action hurt their children's chances of admission to college. Only a minority of American parents (and only a minority of white parents) believe that this is the case. (A key caveat: Gallup officials did not consider that their sampling of Asian-American parents was large enough to draw conclusions about their views, and Asian-American groups have been split on affirmative action.) Inside Higher Ed surveyed parents at a time of growing public debate over affirmative action in higher education. The Supreme Court has heard arguments but has yet to issue a ruling in challenge to the consideration of race in admissions by the University of Texas at Austin.

The rule establishes a presumption of denial for all such exports or reexports to the Crimea region of Ukraine and transfers within the Crimea region of Ukraine, except with respect to items authorized under the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) General License No. 4, which BIS will review on a case-by-case basis.

These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India. BIS also makes conforming changes in this rule., 37517=This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations to create License Exception Support for the Cuban People (SCP) to authorize the export and reexport of certain items to Cuba that are intended to improve the living conditions of the Cuban people; support independent economic activity and strengthen civil society in Cuba; and improve the free flow of information to, from, and among the Cuban people. It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines. These actions are among those announced by the President on December 17, 2014, aimed at supporting the ability of the Cuban people to gain greater control over their own lives and determine their country's future., 45088=Title 15 published on 2015-01-01, 43843=√Ç¬ß 1702 - Presidential authorities, 44214=√Ç¬ß 1706 - Savings provisions, 44303=√Ç¬ß 1707 - Multinational economic embargoes against governments in armed conflict with the United States, 9363=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issues this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to facilitate Internet-based communications with persons in the Crimea region of Ukraine. This final rule allows exports or reexports without a license to the Crimea region of Ukraine of software that is necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet, provided that such software is designated EAR99, or is classified as mass market software under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5D992.c of the EAR, and provided further that such software is widely available to the public at no cost to the user. This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR. These clarifications are in response to requests that BIS received for guidance on applying these provisions., 44134=√Ç¬ß 1705 - Penalties, 44033=√Ç¬ß 1704 - Authority to issue regulations, 73673=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) proposes to implement the agreements by the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) at the Plenary meeting in December 2013 with regard to systems, equipment or components specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; software specially designed or modified for the development or production of such systems, equipment or components; software specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; technology required for the development of intrusion software; Internet Protocol (IP) network communications surveillance systems or equipment and test, inspection, production equipment, specially designed components therefor, and development and production software and technology therefor. BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items. BIS also proposes to add the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úintrusion software√¢¬Ä? to the definition section of the EAR pursuant to the WA 2013 agreements., 14927=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains, as part of its Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies certain of the items subject to Department of Commerce jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States. In addition, the second national security column and the second regional stability column of the Commerce Country Chart are amended to harmonize with each other, as well as make changes based on the risk of diversion to unauthorized end user, end uses or destinations., 44827=Notice ... Aug. 8, 2013, 3079=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the recommendations presented at the November 2013 Australia Group (AG) intersessional implementation meeting and later adopted pursuant to the AG silent approval procedure. Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

BIS also proposes to add the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úintrusion software√¢¬Ä? to the definition section of the EAR pursuant to the WA 2013 agreements., 14927=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains, as part of its Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies certain of the items subject to Department of Commerce jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States. In addition, the second national security column and the second regional stability column of the Commerce Country Chart are amended to harmonize with each other, as well as make changes based on the risk of diversion to unauthorized end user, end uses or destinations., 44827=Notice ... Aug. 8, 2013, 3079=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the recommendations presented at the November 2013 Australia Group (AG) intersessional implementation meeting and later adopted pursuant to the AG silent approval procedure. Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India. BIS also makes conforming changes in this rule., 37517=This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations to create License Exception Support for the Cuban People (SCP) to authorize the export and reexport of certain items to Cuba that are intended to improve the living conditions of the Cuban people; support independent economic activity and strengthen civil society in Cuba; and improve the free flow of information to, from, and among the Cuban people. It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines.

This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR.

The rule establishes a presumption of denial for all such exports or reexports to the Crimea region of Ukraine and transfers within the Crimea region of Ukraine, except with respect to items authorized under the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) General License No. 4, which BIS will review on a case-by-case basis.

On January 25, 2011, BIS published the first rule in a series of rules to implement the bilateral understanding between the two countries. These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India.

It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines.

This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR.

BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items.

This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States.

BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items.

This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States.

Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

This final rule allows exports or reexports without a license to the Crimea region of Ukraine of software that is necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet, provided that such software is designated EAR99, or is classified as mass market software under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5D992.c of the EAR, and provided further that such software is widely available to the public at no cost to the user. This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR. These clarifications are in response to requests that BIS received for guidance on applying these provisions., 44134=√Ç¬ß 1705 - Penalties, 44033=√Ç¬ß 1704 - Authority to issue regulations, 73673=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) proposes to implement the agreements by the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) at the Plenary meeting in December 2013 with regard to systems, equipment or components specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; software specially designed or modified for the development or production of such systems, equipment or components; software specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; technology required for the development of intrusion software; Internet Protocol (IP) network communications surveillance systems or equipment and test, inspection, production equipment, specially designed components therefor, and development and production software and technology therefor. BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items. BIS also proposes to add the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úintrusion software√¢¬Ä? to the definition section of the EAR pursuant to the WA 2013 agreements., 14927=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains, as part of its Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies certain of the items subject to Department of Commerce jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States. In addition, the second national security column and the second regional stability column of the Commerce Country Chart are amended to harmonize with each other, as well as make changes based on the risk of diversion to unauthorized end user, end uses or destinations., 44827=Notice ... Aug. 8, 2013, 3079=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the recommendations presented at the November 2013 Australia Group (AG) intersessional implementation meeting and later adopted pursuant to the AG silent approval procedure. Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States. In addition, the second national security column and the second regional stability column of the Commerce Country Chart are amended to harmonize with each other, as well as make changes based on the risk of diversion to unauthorized end user, end uses or destinations., 44827=Notice ... Aug. 8, 2013, 3079=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the recommendations presented at the November 2013 Australia Group (AG) intersessional implementation meeting and later adopted pursuant to the AG silent approval procedure. Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.

On January 25, 2011, BIS published the first rule in a series of rules to implement the bilateral understanding between the two countries. These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India. BIS also makes conforming changes in this rule., 37517=This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations to create License Exception Support for the Cuban People (SCP) to authorize the export and reexport of certain items to Cuba that are intended to improve the living conditions of the Cuban people; support independent economic activity and strengthen civil society in Cuba; and improve the free flow of information to, from, and among the Cuban people. It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines. These actions are among those announced by the President on December 17, 2014, aimed at supporting the ability of the Cuban people to gain greater control over their own lives and determine their country's future., 45088=Title 15 published on 2015-01-01, 43843=√Ç¬ß 1702 - Presidential authorities, 44214=√Ç¬ß 1706 - Savings provisions, 44303=√Ç¬ß 1707 - Multinational economic embargoes against governments in armed conflict with the United States, 9363=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issues this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to facilitate Internet-based communications with persons in the Crimea region of Ukraine.

This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR.

BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items.

On January 25, 2011, BIS published the first rule in a series of rules to implement the bilateral understanding between the two countries. These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India.

It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines.

This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR.

BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items.

This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States.

The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves.

Specifically, in this rule BIS amends the EAR by imposing a license requirement for the export and reexport to the Crimea region of Ukraine, and the transfer within the Crimea region of Ukraine, of all items subject to the EAR, other than food and medicine designated as EAR99. The rule establishes a presumption of denial for all such exports or reexports to the Crimea region of Ukraine and transfers within the Crimea region of Ukraine, except with respect to items authorized under the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) General License No. 4, which BIS will review on a case-by-case basis. This action is consistent with the goals and objectives of Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014., 43667=√Ç¬ß 1701 - Unusual and extraordinary threat; declaration of national emergency; exercise of Presidential authorities, 43938=√Ç¬ß 1703 - Consultation and reports, 32499=In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to further implement the bilateral understanding between the United States and India announced by President Obama and India's Prime Minister Singh on November 8, 2010. On January 25, 2011, BIS published the first rule in a series of rules to implement the bilateral understanding between the two countries. These rules fulfill the President's and Prime Minister's commitment to work together to strengthen the global nonproliferation and export control framework and further transform our bilateral export control cooperation to realize the full potential of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Specifically, in this rule, to further implement the November 8, 2010 bilateral understanding, BIS removes license requirements for certain items controlled for crime control and regional stability reasons to India. BIS also makes conforming changes in this rule., 37517=This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations to create License Exception Support for the Cuban People (SCP) to authorize the export and reexport of certain items to Cuba that are intended to improve the living conditions of the Cuban people; support independent economic activity and strengthen civil society in Cuba; and improve the free flow of information to, from, and among the Cuban people. It also amends existing License Exception Consumer Communications Devices (CCD) by eliminating the donation requirement, thereby authorizing sales of certain communications items to eligible end users in Cuba. Additionally, it amends License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT) to authorize exports of multiple gift parcels in a single shipment. Lastly, this rule establishes a general policy of approval for exports and reexports to Cuba of items for the environmental protection of U.S. and international air quality, and waters, and coastlines. These actions are among those announced by the President on December 17, 2014, aimed at supporting the ability of the Cuban people to gain greater control over their own lives and determine their country's future., 45088=Title 15 published on 2015-01-01, 43843=√Ç¬ß 1702 - Presidential authorities, 44214=√Ç¬ß 1706 - Savings provisions, 44303=√Ç¬ß 1707 - Multinational economic embargoes against governments in armed conflict with the United States, 9363=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issues this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to facilitate Internet-based communications with persons in the Crimea region of Ukraine. This final rule allows exports or reexports without a license to the Crimea region of Ukraine of software that is necessary to enable the exchange of personal communications over the Internet, provided that such software is designated EAR99, or is classified as mass market software under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5D992.c of the EAR, and provided further that such software is widely available to the public at no cost to the user. This final rule is being published simultaneously with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issuance of General License No. 9, which authorizes the export or reexport from the United States or by U.S. persons to the Crimea region of Ukraine of certain services and software incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet. This action is consistent with the U.S. Government's policy to promote personal communications between the people in Crimea and the outside world. Lastly, this final rule makes clarifications to the EAR with respect to the addition of the Crimea region of Ukraine provisions in a final rule published on January, 29, 2015, to the EAR. These clarifications are in response to requests that BIS received for guidance on applying these provisions., 44134=√Ç¬ß 1705 - Penalties, 44033=√Ç¬ß 1704 - Authority to issue regulations, 73673=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) proposes to implement the agreements by the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) at the Plenary meeting in December 2013 with regard to systems, equipment or components specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; software specially designed or modified for the development or production of such systems, equipment or components; software specially designed for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, intrusion software; technology required for the development of intrusion software; Internet Protocol (IP) network communications surveillance systems or equipment and test, inspection, production equipment, specially designed components therefor, and development and production software and technology therefor. BIS proposes a license requirement for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of these cybersecurity items to all destinations, except Canada. Although these cybersecurity capabilities were not previously designated for export control, many of these items have been controlled for their √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality, including encryption and cryptanalysis. This rule thus continues applicable Encryption Items (EI) registration and review requirements, while setting forth proposed license review policies and special submission requirements to address the new cybersecurity controls, including submission of a letter of explanation with regard to the technical capabilities of the cybersecurity items. BIS also proposes to add the definition of √¢¬Ä¬úintrusion software√¢¬Ä? to the definition section of the EAR pursuant to the WA 2013 agreements., 14927=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains, as part of its Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies certain of the items subject to Department of Commerce jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL to implement changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement's List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar List) maintained and agreed to by governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the December 2014 WA Plenary Meeting (the Plenary). The twentieth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement was held in Vienna on 2 to 3 December 2014. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the objective of improving regional and international security and stability. Wassenaar Participating States agreed to new export controls in a number of areas, including spacecraft equipment (Category 9) and technology for fly-by-wire/flight-by-light systems (Category 7), while texts for the control of machine tools (Category 2) and optical equipment for military utility and fiber laser components (Category 6) were substantially revised. In addition, significant reviews of several categories resulted in the deletion of obsolete controls relating to vessels (Category 8) and in refined controls on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles√¢¬Ä¬îUAVs (Category 9), specifically taking note of the substantial progress of technology in that area. Wassenaar Participating States modified controls in a number of other areas, such as equipment for production of electronic devices (Category 3), certain telecommunications equipment where encryption and other √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is limited to operations, administration, or maintenance (OAM) tasks (Category 5P2), and general purpose computers or servers where standard √¢¬Ä¬úinformation security√¢¬Ä? functionality is provided by embedded mass market microprocessors (CPUs) or operating systems (also Category 5P2). This rule amends the CCL by implementing the changes agreed to by the WA at the Plenary by revising 42 Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), adding one ECCN and removing one ECCN, as well as amending the General Technology Note, WA reporting requirements, adding seven (7) definitions and revising six (6) definitions in the EAR. This rule also revises 3 ECCNs to add License Exception CIV eligibility for Anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment and related software and technology for the development and production of this equipment, as a result of BIS' foreign availability assessment. Country Group A column 1, the Coordinating Committee (CoCom) member countries, is replaced with the successor national security export regime the Wassenaar Arrangement Participating States. In addition, the second national security column and the second regional stability column of the Commerce Country Chart are amended to harmonize with each other, as well as make changes based on the risk of diversion to unauthorized end user, end uses or destinations., 44827=Notice ... Aug. 8, 2013, 3079=The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) publishes this final rule to amend the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the recommendations presented at the November 2013 Australia Group (AG) intersessional implementation meeting and later adopted pursuant to the AG silent approval procedure. Specifically, this rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) entry in the EAR that controls certain human and zoonotic pathogens and toxins, and removes the CCL entry that controls certain animal pathogens to reflect the merger of two AG common control lists based on recommendations presented at the AG intersessional implementation meeting. As a result of these recommendations, the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Animal Pathogens for Export Control√¢¬Ä? was merged with the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Biological Agents for Export Control,√¢¬Ä? creating a single AG common control list for these items ( i.e., the AG √¢¬Ä¬úList of Human and Animal Pathogens and Toxins for Export Control√¢¬Ä?). The scope of the controls on these human and animal pathogens and toxins was not affected by the merger of the two lists into a single AG common control list. This rule also makes conforming amendments to other provisions in the EAR to reflect these changes. In addition, this rule amends the CCL entry that controls chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment to reflect changes to the AG √¢¬Ä¬úControl List of Dual-Use Chemical Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment and Related Technology and Software,√¢¬Ä? based on the November 2013 AG intersessional recommendation to revise controls on certain valves, casings (valve bodies) designed for such valves, and preformed casing liners designed for such valves. This rule also amends this CCL entry to add a Technical Note clarifying how the terms √¢¬Ä¬úmulti-seal√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úseal-less√¢¬Ä? are used with respect to the controls on pumps. In a change unrelated to any revisions to the AG common control lists or guidelines, this rule also amends this CCL entry to authorize the use of License Exception LVS for specified shipments. This rule does not contain changes based on the understandings reached at the June 2014 AG Plenary meeting, because no amendments to the EAR were required as a result of these understandings.}","Additional Documents GPO FDSys XML | Text 80 FR 34266 - Implementation of the Australia Group (AG) November 2013 Intersessional Decisions 2015-06-16; vol. 80 # 115 - Tuesday, June 16, 2015 For a complete list of all Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices view the Rulemaking tab.
