The University holds high rankings in all these fields and #1 in Nanoscale Engineering. Also, if you're looking for a place with a lot of school spirit, this is the place. Great Dane pride is everywhere and you will always see purple and gold (school's colors) everywhere. If you are a student that wants to major in French, Italian, Russian, or Theater, I would recommend you do your research and make sure you still want to come here. Funding issues could lead to the removal of these departments from campus"", ""Get involved! It's a great way to get to know people on campus. College isn't all about grades, it's also about networking. A strong GPA might catch an employers attention, but a friendship or recommendation can land the deal. If you don't like any clubs on campus, you could start your own free of charge, and receive funding from the Student Association (student government). The most important tip I could give incoming students; never go downtown alone. Although SUNY Albany is located in a safe neighborhood, the downtown area is notorious for crimes. On weekends, many frats/sororities and other students have parties downtown. Criminals are outside around these times specifically looking for people walking alone. Don't make yourself look like an easy target. If you do go out, don't take any cups from any strangers and don't drink the jungle juice! Oh, I almost forgot! Always stay in contact with your advisor! The earlier you register, the better your classes!"", ""The University costs about $20,000 right now. It's pretty cheap considering the rankings and reviews this school gets on public policy, business, social welfare, criminal justice, engineering, and education. It has a partnership with the NYS Legislature for internships as well. Although it may seem cheap now, tuition may go up in the near future. Funding is a major problem in the SUNY system now and programs have been cut (theater, French, Italian). It all depends on what you want to major/minor in. Each quad contains 8 residence halls. Each residence hall is equipped with washing machines and dryers. They are all free of charge. Also, the tower of each quad has a free gym for whoever wants to avoid the freshmen 15! Other expenses Transportation here was a little weird for me. If you want to take a bus somewhere, it's free. Whether it's a shuttle or public transportation, uAlbany students get on for free. Cab rides are $7 is you're alone, $4 each for 2-3 people, and $3 for 4 or more. Food here is cheap.... well pizza is cheap. A slice of pizza in the City of Albany can range from $1-$2, but don't worry, the quality is still there. There is a Wal-Mart conveniently located around campus if you need to buy...well they sell everything. They're open 24hrs on weekdays!"", 'I do enjoy being here. Whether you wanna play football, have a debate, or listen to some live music, there is always something to do after class. The student government funds over 200 groups on campus. There are other colleges in Albany area too (St. Rose, and Siena). This is a great college town. If you wanna go downtown with a group of your friends to find a good movie, eat, or party, there is always something going on.', 'I am learning a lot both in the classroom and outside of it. In the classroom, information was thrown at me twice as fast than in high school. Outside of it, you get to learn how to manage your own money, setting up your personal schedule (this is a big one!), how to do your laundry, etc. There are also a lot of internships and academic support on and off campus. Tutors are free, and there are many offices that can review research, or other assignments for you.

Take advantage of the library and its librarians. Get to know your professors and establish a relationship with them as it will definitely help you in and out of the classroom. Make sure to keep in touch with your adviser; they are very helpful in managing your classes and credits for graduation and/or transfer. They'll help you out with anything you ask them, or at least point you in the right direction! STUDY! You may have gotten by in high school by barely studying, or not studying... but in college, if you don't study, you'll fail. Do Not Procrastinate. Having trouble making friends? Join a club or get involved with some of the activities the school has to offer! Parking is a big pain. Make sure to arrive on campus (if you commute) about 15-20 minutes before your class begins. I guarantee you'll need it to find a parking spot and get to class on time."", ""You definitely get your money's worth at UAlbany.

Almost everybody gets it; it's around $250 per semester."", ""I grew up in a small town high school; I then transferred to a small community college. I'll admit, I was afraid to transfer to UAlbany, whose population is an outstanding 19,000+ students. But I never looked back. The campus is beautiful all year round, even in the cold, winter months. There's a lot of things to do all year round, either on campus or off campus. UAlbany's campus is conveniently located a few minutes from the mall, gas stations, grocery stores, convenience stores, tanning salons, etc. I also like the diversity. There are so many different nationalities and such at the school, and we all mix together and nobody minds. There are definitely a lot of interesting people on campus that you'll come across and maybe even meet."", ""I transferred in from a community college, and noticed the huge difference between there and UAlbany. Firstly, the teachers are more dedicated and committed to teaching you and you actually learn and retain more. Secondly, the difficulty starts with easy and gradually increases to hard so that you actually start learning things.

But the campus is separate enough so you don't feel like you're crowded in a city. I joined several clubs which I never pictured myself ever doing and found a number of amazing people to hang out with. To be honest, I didn't want to come to UA at first. I hated the idea. Until one time I visited and I felt comfortable with the place. Now I coming here was one of the best choices I have ever made. Am learning a lot I'm learning so much in the books and so much more outside of it! Take advantage of your teacher's office hours, join some clubs, meet people and have fun. The honors courses are exceptional and I can't believe how much my process of thinking has changed. It's a different experience for everyone. Mine has been amazing.

You will walk around and find people representing their sororities or fraternities and not know who they are because you really don't see much activity from them on campus. There are some that are very recognizable on campus such as Groove Phi Groove, and the Kappa's."", 'At SUNY Albany you will find that there is a large range of clubs. At the beginning of fall semester there is block party where all the clubs gather at a set locations and the incoming freshman and transfer students check out the clubs that they are interested in. Also during the semesters the school hosts events where various artists come and perform. We also have a lot of guest speakers come to our school.', ""I find that in attending SUNY Albany that it is one of the cheaper state schools and thus I feel the amount I'm paying is worth the education I get out of it. Whereas is some private schools students have to pay for laundry, I on the other hand have free laundry and I don't pay as much as they do."", ""There are many things that can be done for fun. There are many clubs to join and if you don't like the choices available then there is always the choice to start your own. Bowling in the area is really cheap and fun. If you want to catch a movie you can buy tickets on campus for around seven dollars and catch the movie at the theater in the mall. There is also ice-skating in the area. Joining a sport is also always an option. There are also intramural sports. These go on year round."", ""Also living on campus I find that many people including myself are not too happy with the food selections. Some dining halls are rated better than others but I find the opinions are usually bias. I meals usually consists of sandwiches, salads, and pizza. There is a Wendy's on campus that usually draws a crowd. It is also very hard to eat healthy because there is not a lot of options and you may find yourself eating a lot of the same things."", 'Living on campus has its pros and cons and depending where you live and whom you live with, you may have different experiences. Most common complaints I hear are about heat; that can be either too much or none. Some people get stuck with incompatible room mates which also tends to make there living experiences horrible. Another complaint would be the that the building leak when it rains if people leave there windows open in the towers. Which also leaves room for draft during the brutal winters.', 'I find that the academic vigor varies within the majors but most often then not I find my course to be somewhat challenging. All classes I have taken have required me read before hand for each lecture. Exams are also challenging and require hours of studying.', 'Specific tips that I would have for prospective students would be to take advantage of office hours. They are very beneficial when you have questions and they allow for the professor to know you. Also another tip would be to practice time management.

The advantage of having so much diversity on campus, is having a plethora of clubs and teams. There's bound to be one that grabs your interest. People also tend to party a lot in downtown Albany. If you have some friends and know where to go it could be fun if you're in to that kind of thing."", ""The food is nothing special. There are 4 dining halls on the campus, one in each quadrant. These dining halls rotate the foods they serve daily and are open from around 7:30 am to 8:00 pm with the exception of one hall. I personally think closing the hall at 8:00 pm is a little to early but it's not entirely that bad. The campus center also has several dining options where you can get sub sandwiches, pizza slices, sushi, deli sandwiches, chinese, and mexican food depending on your meal plan. These places are open until 11:00 pm on weekdays so I always try to utilize these places to the best of my ability. The campus center food usually tastes better than the dining hall food. There is also a food market where you can purchase milk shakes, all sorts of beverages, freezer foods, dry foods like crackers, candy, and hot soup until late at night as well. The milk shakes are surprisingly good so I recommend trying those at least once. If you keep some snacks in your room for late a night, you shouldn't be too hungry most of the time."", ""I can't imagine dorm life is too much different from other colleges, but UAlbany utilizes a suite dorm style more often than the traditional 2 room mate dorms. In a suite, you can have up to 7 or 8 people you share a bathroom with but in my experience, I only had to share with 5 other people. Your dorm experience depends entirely on the type of room and suite mates you have. You have a chance of picking your room mate by filling out a form or requesting a person, however, your suite mates are totally random. Suite mates give you an opportunity to make more immediate friends but also has a downfall if you can't agree to respect each other. Usually if the later happens, you can talk to an RA about your situation and may be able to switch rooms. I personally like to have a bathroom that is only shared with a couple other people. You don't have to leave your dorm to walk down the hallway to use a communal one. However, the cleaning lady only comes once a week to clean your bathroom so make sure it's up to you and your suite mates to keep your dorm bathroom as tolerable as possible until then. Living on campus also gives you an opportunity to make many friends, as the nearest dining hall from you is usually only 2 minutes away. You can make friends in your hall, or meet new people in the dining hall. Everything is definitely accessible in a walking distance."", ""Perhaps because I'm a freshman, the classes really don't seem to be difficult. I'm majoring in psychology and computer science so I have a mix of technology classes and social science classes. As a freshman, most classes will be in lecture centers so your professor won't get the ability to know your personally unless you really make an effort to make them do so. Because professors have such huge classes, I find that they don't give out much homework at all and the tests are easy as long as you look at the textbooks for the class. You may also get some smaller classrooms with around 30 people in it and even then I didn't find those classes too hard. As long as you stay involved and participate you might not even have to study too hard. Remember, you're in college at this point and that means you WANT to be there. Take classes you have interest in so that participating in class can actually be fun for you and studying will be less annoying."", ""Always look at your syllabus and manage your time accordingly. Professors usually tell you when assignments are due in advance and when tests will be held so you have the advantage of studying or contacting a TA (or professor) for help in the allotted time if you need it. If you know what you want to major in that's great but don't feel bad or worried if you don't know what you want to do yet. Take classes that interest you or get your general education classes out of the way first. You have until junior year to make a decision and even then counselors are there to help you out with that sort of thing."", ""UAlbany is a great school in diversity. There are many people that come from different social and ethnic backgrounds so you can learn about many different cultures and lifestyles if you get to know people. UAlbany also offers many academic paths and doesn't force you to choose a major until junior year.""]]",University at Albany (UAlbany) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-at-Albany/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/119385,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,109,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00102-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905947959,905844604,HORIZONTAL,"{535289=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 10334=Weather tips: Albany has two extremes in terms of weather.

There is one catch: the tunnels don't connect to the main university; but with a couple of weeks into your entry, you will become quite skilled in getting from one building to another to your benefit. When the college tours say there is always something to do, there is! Most of the time something is happening right in front of the campus center. They give out free things, so make sure to always keep an eye out!""]]",University at Albany (UAlbany) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-at-Albany/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/119385,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,124,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00102-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905947959,905844604,HORIZONTAL,"{535289=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 10334=Weather tips: Albany has two extremes in terms of weather.

The 3 color values have 9 bits of precision, and they share a single exponent. The computation for these values is not as simple as for GL_R11F_G11F_B10F, and they aren't appropriate for everything. But they can provide better results than that format if most of the colors in the image have approximately the same exponent, or are too small to be significant. This is a required format, but it is not required for renderbuffers; do not expect to be able to render to these. sRGB colorspace Normally, colorspaces are assumed to be linear. However, it is often useful to provide color values in non-linear colorspaces. OpenGL provides support for the sRGB colorspace with two formats: GL_SRGB8: sRGB image with no alpha. GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8: sRGB image with a linear Alpha. These are normalized integer formats. When used as a render target, OpenGL will automatically convert the output colors into the sRGB colorspace if, and only if, GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB is enabled. The alpha will be written as given. Compressed formats Texture compression is a valuable memory-saving tool, one that you should use whenever it is applicable. There are two kinds of compressed formats in OpenGL: generic and specific.

Through this program I have been working at a full-time internship with a mentor teacher in a sixth grade ELA class at Putnam Avenue Upper School in Cambridge. I will continue taking courses through this summer but will complete my internship requirement in May. As I work on my job search for the fall, I am looking to find a position as a Nanny or consistent babysitter this spring-summer. I grew up in Weybridge, VT and attended the University of Vermont as an undergrad. I have worked at a summer camp in Vermont, Songadeewin of Keewaydin on Lake Dunmore, for the past seven summers where I have grown into and earned different leadership roles. This is a camp kids from age 7-15 stay for either a month or two months and each month embark on a canoeing or hiking wilderness trip from 4 - 16 days long. Last spring, in April and May 2013, I worked as an instructor at another program the Keewaydin Foundation runs. KEEC (Keewaydin Environmental Education Center) is a program where elementary school classes come and stay at camp Monday-Friday as a school trip. There I worked with kids to instill greater understanding for varieties of ""community"" through outdoor academic investigations, group games, and living practices. After graduating UVM, I spent two winters working as a children's ski instructor. I lived in Park City, UT while working at Canyons resort in the 2011-2012 season where I earned their ""Rookie of the Year"" instructor award. Last winter I lived and worked in Stowe, VT and there I earned ""Kids Instructor of the Year"" as well as ""3-ski All Star."" As part of my full time ski instructing in Stowe I was an instructor in Stowe's ""Mini-Buster"" program for 4-6 year olds. This is a season-long program where I taught the same group of kids every weekend. It is an amazing program for kids, instructors, and families. I became close with these families, often babysitting for them throughout the season. In Stowe I also worked at a restaurant at The Hob Knob Inn and worked as a lifeguard at The Swimming Hole pool and gym. I love working with kids of all ages and in both these places, as well as throughout my life, I have had many babysitting jobs that have lasted a long time. I love the type of work that allows me to get to know people and develop meaningful relationships!}",

I have experience with reactive dogs, clicker training (dogs and cats) and horse training. I have had pets around and have been caring for them for as long as I can remember. Through high school and college I volunteered at the animal shelter in Iowa City, training dogs to increase their adoptability. I worked for 2 years at a veterinary clinic in college, taking care of patients, administering medication, giving routine shots and preparing lab work. After moving to Colorado, I volunteered for four years at Blue Rose Ranch, a horse rescue in Springfield where I loved on abused and neglected horses and trained them to help them find forever homes. I am currently an elementary music teacher, and I have fur kids too! I have two dogs, three cats, two homing pigeons and two horses. I grew up bringing home dogs and cats and other homeless critters, and spent quite a bit of time on my grandpa's farm. Lesley√¢¬Ä¬ôs Bio",References Cheryl W. is a reference for Lesley J.
