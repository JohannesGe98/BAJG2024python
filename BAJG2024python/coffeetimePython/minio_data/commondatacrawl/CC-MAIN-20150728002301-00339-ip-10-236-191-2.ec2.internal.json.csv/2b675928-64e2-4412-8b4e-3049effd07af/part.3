The arboretum is a nice place to go for a walk, read or have a picnic. Sometimes movies are played outside on a big screen just outside of the dorms.

The deserts are displayed in the front and they always look good, so beware the freshman fifteen. There are no trays in the gastronome (sometimes nicknamed the nome) which can make getting food from different sections difficult. right next door is the Late Night Cafe that is opened on week nights for students who have either a late classes or just want to stop on in for a midnight snack. Nearby there is a student store which has open up just recently where students can buy groceries. Necessities are on the lower pice side whereas treats are far more expensive.

The dorms are one room with two large beds (which can be rearranged into bunk beds if a request is made), two study desks which are on the smallest side but not bad, and two closets which have plenty of space. Space between each roommates side of the room is very limited. Also the carpet is of a darker color so it's harder to tell how dirty it is, so make sure to vacuum more than twice in the entire year ( Vacuums can be checked out for free at the housing office). The cafeteria is nearby as well which is nice considering there is no kitchen in the freshmen dorms."", 'Major classes are taken very seriously and if a student does not work hard they will not last in that major for very long. That being said, the teachers are always ready to help a struggling student that is willing to put effort in. Every teacher has office hours so their students can come to talk with them, and most teachers are also willing to set up outside appointments if someone is unable to make it to office hours. General education classes are perhaps not as rigorous, but no walk in the park and the teachers tend to be equally as passionate. In both causes, how much one can get out of a class is dependent on the student.', 'Procrastination is a horrible habit which in the long run leaves students having less time to be with friends, relax, and be a part of other activities. Also, always show up to class. I, for one, have only ever missed class if I was feeling ready to die from sickness, yet I have had friends who have failed classes from just not attending. Going to class is a means of absorbing information verbally which is helpful when studying because your brain has already processed what was said, therefore less time can be spent studying yet understanding the material more.', ""California State University of Fullerton has a staff of well informed professors and are always ready to help any student.

Even within California, Cal State Fullerton is decently priced. Am enjoying being here At Cal State Fullerton, I have met some very kind, helpful, and intelligent teachers as well as friendly and smart students. However, a lot of teachers don't push their students to learn more and try harder. Especially in GE classes, more than half of the students in a particular class only want to pass the class with a C. This is the case in most colleges, but I hadn't expected it when I enrolled at this university. I would enjoy a more challenging environment. Am learning a lot During my first year of college, I found that there is so much a student can learn - whether it be in-depth knowledge in a particular subject or about the college system itself - moreover, each student is responsible for taking the initiative to learn.

Within the last year, tuition has increased almost $1,000. Not only has tuition increased, but teachers are being told to take furlough 6 days a semester that will cut their salaries by 10%. Students are paying 30% more, but is receiving 10% less for their education because teachers don't have classes on their furlough days. Even with the tuition hikes, Cal State University, Fullerton is more affordable than other 4-year universities. Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home. There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable.",True,0,0,,"{966479=Many on campus places are good and there is nice variety on and off campus, but i must give this category two stars for unresolved issue that affects the students.

I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.

I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions.

Students are paying 30% more, but is receiving 10% less for their education because teachers don't have classes on their furlough days.

Within the last year, tuition has increased almost $1,000. Not only has tuition increased, but teachers are being told to take furlough 6 days a semester that will cut their salaries by 10%. Students are paying 30% more, but is receiving 10% less for their education because teachers don't have classes on their furlough days. Even with the tuition hikes, Cal State University, Fullerton is more affordable than other 4-year universities. Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home. There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable.

I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.

The state budget crisis for the 2009-2010 school year has however made the cost rise. Although it has been hectic registering for classes as well as paying for classes this year, I still feel like the education at this school is worth the money. Some people go to community colleges before a university, but I personally think that holds students back and it usually takes them 5 years to graduate. Going to CSUF straight out of high school is definitely worth the money., 465367=California State University, Fullerton is a very cozy campus with everything the college student needs. The student-professor ratio (in my classes) is about 24:1, which is excellent for those who need easier access to their professor.

But, I believe it will be worthed., 736044=A campus tradition is that during finals or tests, if you rub the fallen Statue of David's butt cheek you'll get good luck haha. I've done it and I got an A! Also there's snow day, in October they bring snow into the quad and you can go sledding. There's also the annual spring concert in may, last year we had Mike Posner and Hunter Hayes., 607466=Cal State Fullerton is the perfect school if you want to get involved.

I met countless life long friends there and even my husband!, 660772=When I visited California State University, Fullerton in September 2012, I knew that I wanted this to be my future school. The resources that the schools provides to its students drew me in.

Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution. Having priority registration is a big deal because it's very difficult to get the classes you need with the budget cuts (they cut lots of classes). Also, look your professors up on RateMyProfessor.com because having a good professor makes a BIG difference., 660157=Unsure yet, but I will be living in the apartments on campus beginning in January 2013., 947501=My first semester as a returning transfer student at Cal State Fullerton was more than I could have asked for.

Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life.

Within the last year, tuition has increased almost $1,000. Not only has tuition increased, but teachers are being told to take furlough 6 days a semester that will cut their salaries by 10%. Students are paying 30% more, but is receiving 10% less for their education because teachers don't have classes on their furlough days. Even with the tuition hikes, Cal State University, Fullerton is more affordable than other 4-year universities. Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home. There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city.

At California State University - Fullerton, most of the teachers I've come across only give their students the information they need to pass a class. It is up to the student to take time and ask a question or go to office hours so that he can learn and more fully understand the subject.

I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.

There is literally a police station built on campus. The police and campus security are always driving around campus or walking around. Also, when you have a late night class you can look for these little blue poles and press a button and a police official will show up and escort you to your car. I feel very safe while I am on campus. Plus whenever there are serious events going on at campus the school will notify you through your text, email, or a phone call.', 'I do not know much about the Greek Life.

However, they really don't advertise them only a few clubs actually have posters on campus. Usually you have to look them up.

It takes place when finals are over. During the night you basically get to run around the school with your underwear on. It is pretty fun especially when you go in a big group with your friends.', ""There are times when the school seems pricey. For example one semester parking pass for school is $220. For two semesters at school you will pay $440 for parking alone. Which I feel is ridiculous and it's not a guarantee that you will even have a parking spot. The tuition can get kind of crazy when it goes up.

The Underground has a bowling alley, pool tables, and some arcade games. Hanging out there with some of your friends is pretty fun. You can also check out the arboretum which is located next to the dorms. It's full of trees, ponds, ducks, and squirrels it's a nice place to hangout with your friends and have picnic."", ""Food on campus is pretty good there is a Carl's Jr., Togo's, Round Table, and Panda Express.

However, a lot of my friends did and they said they really enjoyed the experience. The dorms usually have a lot of fun activities during the first few weeks of school mainly so people can mingle. During the school year the dorms usually have some sort of weekend activity going on. The dorms are pretty nice and are decently sized.', 'The academics on campus are pretty good. I feel that most of the teachers I had were easy but I did have my share of challenging ones as well. If you can manage your time wisely, take good notes, study hard, do all your assignments, and show up to class you will do great. Most of the professors on campus are highly educated and when you ask them a question they will really break down the topic for you. The classes offered at CSUF are pretty interesting and you do learn a lot from them. Just make sure that when you register you jump on it because classes fill up super fast.', 'Take advantage of your professors office hours.

There are some fraternities and sororities you can join. However, their homes are not located on campus so the campus police does not pass around to see what is happening.', 'There are several clubs to choose from. There are several clubs that deal with an individual major as well as there are clubs which allow people from all different fields of study to join. There is a plus to joining these clubs. When you join you get to know the faculty of your department which allows you to get letters of recommendations and to be nominated for several scholarships. However, you do have to pay a fee to be a part of the club but joining one is so worth it.', 'This campus is perfect for students who are interested in commuting to and from school; this campus is close to most of the southern California counties. In addition this school is good for the introverted students since it is smaller than a UC and buildings are easier to find. Plus, once this student starts taking major courses you start to see the same people and befriend them.', ""One unusual tradition would be that of rubbing the butt of a broken David's statue near our library during finals week. It is said that if you rub the butt you will pass your finals and your courses.

You can also go to the Arboretum to enjoy the scenery and get to see some unusual plants and trees.', ""There are several places in this campus to choose from for eating a meal. The first place would be at the TSU which has distinct fast food chains to choose from. We have Panda Express, Baja Fresh, Togo's, Juice it Up, Round Table Pizza, and a small cafe place; there's food for every type of person. You can even bring your own food from home and use the microwaves located inside the TSU. In addition we have several vending machines and convenient stores around the campus so you can get some snacks and event instant foods. In Langsdorf Hall we have a wrap and sandwich place. There are cafe locations in the campus where you can purchase Starbucks coffee as well as some food trucks. Lastly we have the Gastronome which consists of an all you can eat buffet for the price of eleven dollars and a Carl's Jr. In the end, there are several choices so that you don't have to eat the same thing every time."", ""In the dorms you can meet several people from different parts of the state, the country and even the world. Living in the dorms allows you to create long lasting friendships with your roommate as well as it creates cultural awareness since we have students from different cultures; there's a lot of diversity. Living in these dorms is a lot cheaper than dorm life in the UC's and it even comes with a dining plan where you can eat at the Gastronome of a smaller cost."", ""The lower division courses are doable if you take good notes and do all of your homework.

Take note of your professor's office hours; they will come in handy for some of the harder courses. Be open to taking general education courses that you at first don't think you will like; you just might end up enjoying these courses.

At California State University - Fullerton, most of the teachers I've come across only give their students the information they need to pass a class. It is up to the student to take time and ask a question or go to office hours so that he can learn and more fully understand the subject.

The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life.

Even with the tuition hikes, Cal State University, Fullerton is more affordable than other 4-year universities. Am enjoying being here Cal State University, Fullerton is a commuter school, therefore most of the students in class are there to get it done with so they can go home.

This will save you loads of money by supplying you with free transportation without spending a dime on gas. 2. Student Health Center. The Student Health Center is a lifesaver. If eligible, you can sign up to receive free birth control, pap smears, etc. Medications are also offered at a very low cost to students, saving them a lot of money normally spent on medical necessities. In addition, Cal State offers free group and individual counseling. Maintaining a healthy mental state is key to a good life so having that come at no charge is a blessing. 3. ASI.

There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life.

Living on-campus gives you much more time to become involved, connect with new friends, study, and become independent.

You will have much more fun in college if you belong to clubs and programs."", 'Cal State Fullerton is a great university for students who like small class sizes and one-on-one time with the professors.

Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution.

However, a lot of teachers don't push their students to learn more and try harder. Especially in GE classes, more than half of the students in a particular class only want to pass the class with a C. This is the case in most colleges, but I hadn't expected it when I enrolled at this university. I would enjoy a more challenging environment. Am learning a lot During my first year of college, I found that there is so much a student can learn - whether it be in-depth knowledge in a particular subject or about the college system itself - moreover, each student is responsible for taking the initiative to learn. At California State University - Fullerton, most of the teachers I've come across only give their students the information they need to pass a class. It is up to the student to take time and ask a question or go to office hours so that he can learn and more fully understand the subject.

The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life.

Regardless of what the school's website and tour guides tell you, the Gastronome food SUCKS. Believe me, after 2 weeks you'll be sick of the food, and no matter what you had to pay for a meal plan. I don't regret living on campus, because I met a lot of people from it, and I get to sleep in and just leave 5 minutes before class starts.

From my first semester I can say that I managed to get to know my professors, and they were all nice. The classes aren't super difficult either, but that can be either good or bad for someone that really wants to challenge yourself. There are freshman programs as well, the only thing most people like from them is the free printing. Freshman programs aren't that great though, they made us feel like lost freshman high school students. As well, being in a freshman program requires you to take University 101, everyone I knew that took that class found it to be a waste of time. University 101 doesn't really count for anything. Also, freshman programs tell you to only take 4 classes (12 units) because they tell you it's going to be too difficult, which is a total lie, taking 4 classes was too easy. Besides, if you only take 4 classes per semester will make you end up graduating in 6 year."", ""It is an affordable school. You will learn a lot.

There isn't much of a social aspect here and it's difficult to meet new friends. The school has apartment-style dorms that house only 800 students, which is only 2% of the student population. There are much more students that live off campus, but they are dispersed throughout the city. Meeting people in class is difficult and you have to make an effort to meet people- check out the clubs and student organizations on campus at the DiscoverFest held in the quad at the beginning of the semester, it will make your experience here more enjoyable. Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions.
