If the permissions expose an immediate danger, the application should stop functioning until the issue is fixed, otherwise, notifying or alerting the administrator should be sufficient.

Get answers to - What can each user role do on which resource with what constraint? This will help you in deducing who cannot do what on which resource. What are the policies across groups? Consider the following privileges, ""Approve expense report"" or ""Book a conference room"" or ""Transfer money from own account to another user's account"". A privilege could be thought of as a combination of a verb (e.g. Approve, Book, Withdraw) and one or more nouns (Expense report, conference room, account). The output of this activity is a grid with the various privileges forming the leftmost column while all user roles and groups would form the column headings of other columns. There would also be a Ã¢Â€ÂœCommentsÃ¢Â€? column that qualifies data in this grid. Access rights of various user roles and groups - The application allows various users the privilege on some resource (or asset) and we need to specify the constraints of these privileges. One simple way to know these business rules/ constraints is to make use of the application documentation effectively. For example look for clauses like ""If the administrator allows individual user access.."", ""If configured by the administrator.."" and you know the restriction imposed by the application. Engineering Marketing","This data is a key input for designing logical tests. Developing logical tests Here is a guideline to design logical tests from the raw data gathered. Privilege Table - Make use of the privilege table as a reference while creating application specific logical threats. In general, develop a test for each admin privilege to check if it could be executed illegally by a user role with minimum privileges or no privilege. For example: Privilege: Operations Manager cannot approver a customer order Logical Test: Operations Manager approves a customer order Improper handling of special user action sequences - By navigating through an application in a certain way or revisiting pages out of synch can cause logical errors which may cause the application to do something its not meant to. For example: A wizard application where one fills in forms and proceeds to the next step. One can not in any normal way (according to the developers) enter the wizard in the middle of the process. If one bookmarks a middle step (say step 4 of 7) and then continues with the other steps until completion or form submission, then revisits the middle step which was bookmarked this may ""upset"" the backend logic as it was developed with a weak state model. Cover all business transaction paths - While designing tests, check for all alternative ways",True,0,0,"{5859=Business logic can have security flaws that allow a user to do something that isn't allowed by the business. For example, if there is a limit on reimbursement of $1000, could an attacker misuse the system to request more money than is allowed? Or perhaps you are supposed to do operations in a particular order, but an attacker could invoke them in a different order. Or can a user make a purchase for a negative amount of money? Frequently these business logic security checks simply are not there in the application.}"

However, time is a precious commodity in schools and in the teaching profession and, consequently, it is critically important that effective professional development practices be identified and incorporated into the on-going activities within schools, while ineffective practices be avoided. The purpose of this study was to examine teachers' views on the effectiveness of annual professional development plans in promoting professional growth. The study explores whether or not teachers believe that their growth plans led to enhanced or changed classroom practices, teachers' perspectives on the effectiveness of grade level team professional development goals, aspects of the process of developing and completing a professional development plan that were helpful and aspects which should be changed, specific things administrators can do that would be helpful to teachers in their pursuit of professional growth, aspects of a school culture that are conducive to success with professional development plans, teachers' concerns regarding the requirement in provincial policy that all teachers develop annual professional development plans, and teachers' perspectives on the effectiveness of professional growth plans as compared to other professional development approaches used previously. The study was conducted as a case study utilizing an interview approach. The subjects were ten teachers from a rural central Alberta school. All ten of the teachers in the study responded that they believed developing a professional growth plan had helped them to grow professionally. Seven out of the ten teachers interviewed indicated that their growth plan had contributed to enhanced or changed classroom practices. A variety of specific suggestions were offered by the subjects regarding ways to improve the individual growth plan approach to professional growth and ways administrators could be of assistance to teachers. Eight out often teachers indicated that growth plans were more effective in promoting growth than other approaches they have been involved with in the past. An individualized approach to professional development utilizing professional growth plans holds great promise in promoting teacher growth and improved practices."", 'en_US', 'Lethbridge, Alta. : University of Lethbridge, Faculty of Education, 1999', 'Project (University of Lethbridge.
