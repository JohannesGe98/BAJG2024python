No matter where you are at, it is the people you are around that you can learn from. UCI has a lot to offer when it comes to academia. There are numerous Nobel Prize winners, each having a building on campus named after them. Upon arriving at UCI, I took a campus tour and during this tour I knew that I was going to be learning something new every day from the students and from the faculty. For example, did you know that there are 1100+ trees planted in the center of our school (Aldrich Park)? I had no idea! Taking the time out of the day to notice things of beauty like the structure of our campus has made me realize how thankful I am to be learning something new every day. I never walk out of a class empty-handed and wishing I had actually learned something. Instead, I always look forward to the next day of classes, even if it becomes a struggle to wake up in the morning.

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college! For me, UCI is located in a great area and I love that about it.

There are numerous Nobel Prize winners, each having a building on campus named after them. Upon arriving at UCI, I took a campus tour and during this tour I knew that I was going to be learning something new every day from the students and from the faculty. For example, did you know that there are 1100+ trees planted in the center of our school (Aldrich Park)? I had no idea! Taking the time out of the day to notice things of beauty like the structure of our campus has made me realize how thankful I am to be learning something new every day. I never walk out of a class empty-handed and wishing I had actually learned something.

I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused.

Have two copies of everything you might need (if it's too much paper, then have 1 digital and 1 paper copy); I speak from experience--it helps to have these things on hand and it's great if you and the other person can both see something at the same time without having to look over each other's shoulders (and it makes you look super prepared and awesome!)."", 'UCI is the essence of America--a true melting pot of different people and studies.

Yes, you can still have fun but it's also good to be studious. There are a lot of Bio Sci Majors at UCI and there are a lot of Engineering Majors, but that doesn't mean the English or Drama Major cannot get his/her moneys worth at this school. It is a very well-rounded school that not many people know about so take the time to research it. Our sports teams are excellent with some of the top in the nation, yet no one seems to know these things. Tips for prospective students My number one tip is to work hard in high school and to keep that up all the way through until high school is over. There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college.

Our campus is also very safe. ItÃƒÂ¢??s well lit, and we have those emergency blue things everywhere. I havenÃƒÂ¢??t heard about anyone getting rapped or attacked. We have had our fair share of incidents, but nothing that harmed students. Though like all college campuses, there are thefts.', 'The Greek population is very small. We do have a lot of Frats and Sororities. A lot of them are academic based, and only a few of them have houses. WhatÃƒÂ¢??s nice about the greek life is that they have their parties off campus, AND they have shuttles to take people to them.', 'We have a ton of clubs. Pretty much anything you can think of, we have. We also have a lot of martial arts and dance classes at our gym, as well as other recreational sports. You can take archery, fencing, rock climbing, yoga classes, and so much more. We probably have about 12 different kinds of Asian martial arts at our school.', 'Hard working. Driven. Arts students. Medical students. Business students. People who are nice, love to learn, and want to have a fun college experience that will ultimately give them a great degree. If youÃƒÂ¢??re super into partying, then it probably isnÃƒÂ¢??t the best place for you. Irvine (the city) is a pretty low key place.', 'There are these creepy tunnels that run underneath the school. Everyone eventually goes to find them. We have a giant, wonderful park in the middle of the school, called Aldrich Park. ItÃƒÂ¢??s very green and filled with trees. It even has a meditation garden. We have a Pub on campus. ItÃƒÂ¢??s called the pub. ItÃƒÂ¢??s great food, at good prices, and you donÃƒÂ¢??t have to be 21 to go in. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a tradition that when someone turns 21 they get a free pint of beer.', 'Well, this is really a matter of opinion. I think everything is too expensive at UCI, but people havenÃƒÂ¢??t been having to drop out due to budget cuts like they have at Berkley. Some of our programs such as Dance, Drama, and Criminology are in the top 5 in the Nation. We have nobel winners as professors, and have a lot of famous speakers come.', 'There are constantly art shows going on. There are plays, musicals, workshops, improv shows, dance shows, art galleries, and music performances that range from jazz bands and operas, to a cappella groups. Hip Hop groups are really popular on campus. The group Kabba Modern is famous throughout California. Though UCI isnÃƒÂ¢??t a party school, there are still plenty of parties and we do have a Greek System. There are a ton of clubs on campus, ranging from tap dancing and helping animals to law and medical associations. WeÃƒÂ¢??re also very close to serval beaches, as well as LA and Hollywood. WeÃƒÂ¢??re also just a few minuets from an arts center, that has several different theaters. Rock of Ages, Wicked, the famous Russian Ballet, as well as musicians and plays come to this area. There are some clubs and bars in the area, as well.', 'The Cafes on campus are really good, but the dinning halls arenÃƒÂ¢??t. The Mesa Court dining hall really isnÃƒÂ¢??t that good. Food that is easy to make in bulk, like soups and casseroles, are good. The Commons in Middle Earth is a lot better.', 'There are two dorms, Mesa Court and Middle Earth. Mesa ÃƒÂ¢??hallsÃƒÂ¢?? are more like houses. You have your own suits, and share one bathroom with several other people of the same sex. Middle Earth halls are named after places in the Lord of the Rings books, but have smaller rooms. TheyÃƒÂ¢??re actual halls, too. Dorms can be theme, such as a performing arts hall, a music hall, or a gender variant hall.', 'It really depends on your area of interest, and what classes you take. The sciences are extremely competitive, while other classes (such as in Drama) can have a surprisingly heavy course load.', 'Make sure you actually take the time to look into each major, and the school that it is in. For example, the film department isnÃƒÂ¢??t production based at all, and Biology is geared heavily towards pre-med. Different schools have different school requirements. For example, in Humanities you have to take a language, even if you took it in high school. And in Social Ecology you have to take 6 or 7 research classes and do actual research.', 'UC Irvine students are intelligent, and kind people. The teachers do actually care about their students, though sometime admin can be hard to handle. ItÃƒÂ¢??s not a party school, but their is a lively, and fun culture at UCI if you look for it.']]","University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) (UC Irvine) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Irvine-UC-Irvine/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20654,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,148,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00283-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,892799095,892591556,HORIZONTAL,"07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 64 out of 65 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 262 Alina from Torrance, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Yes, you can still have fun but it's also good to be studious. There are a lot of Bio Sci Majors at UCI and there are a lot of Engineering Majors, but that doesn't mean the English or Drama Major cannot get his/her moneys worth at this school. It is a very well-rounded school that not many people know about so take the time to research it. Our sports teams are excellent with some of the top in the nation, yet no one seems to know these things. Tips for prospective students My number one tip is to work hard in high school and to keep that up all the way through until high school is over. There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind.

However, due to a change of chef and staff members, the quality of food at Pippin Common is not that great anymore. The chef seems to put so much oil in everything he or she cooks; even the breakfast is really oil. Mesa Common has similar quality of food as Pippin Common; but Mesa Common is a better environment to enjoy eating lunch and dinner. Because most people usually go to Pippin Common, I understand that it is difficult for staff to complete their cleaning duties. However, Pippin Common still need an improvement in cleaning and food quality. Nevertheless, out of the three dining halls, I would say I that like Brandywine the most. The quality of food is a little better than Pippin and Mesa. Not only that, the food they made at Brandywine really fits my taste. I really recommend its Spam Musubi and Pasta. The negative part about Brandywine is that it is a bad time to eat lunch during 12 because there will be a long line outside.', ""I love my dorm life. It is the best experience since I attend college because most of the closest friends I have met in college are from my hall. I am really grateful that UCI has putted me into a hall with these fantastic people. My hall adviser is really nice and excellent in creating events for the hall. I really had a great time in the hall even though UCI gave me a triple room instead of a double. If you apply for Middle Earth, try to apply for a double or single. I lived in a triple last year and it is the smallest room I have ever lived. I don't think preference really matters when you apply for Middle Earth. One of my friends applied for a single and he got a double instead. I applied for a double and got a triple room. Yet, if you got a triple room, don't be frustrated.

There may be a chance that you think you can survive 20 units, which is 5 courses, in college since you have done so in high school. Well, you may be wrong. Depended on your major, some courses in college are much more difficult than high school courses. Unless you are taking all GE courses, I don't suggest taking 5 courses in one quarter. I would say that courses are not difficult as long as you complete your assignments and ask for help when you need it. If you schedule your time well, you can pass all your courses and receive a dean's list at the end of quarter."", 'I would recommend students read the syllabus before attend their classes.

Sometimes friends are really helpful because you can form a study group and work on the assignments together.', ""UC Irvine has a really great study and social environment for students to engage their learning skills and to expand their social networks. UCI has really great faculty and staff that will be there to help students to find their career.

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college! For me, UCI is located in a great area and I love that about it.

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college!

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college!

There is a bridge that links the campus to a small shopping gallery that hosts a few small restaurants and an Albertsons. If you do not wish to walk that far, there are cafeterias around the campus. Starting from the student center cafeteria, the local clubs set up small stands from where they sell a variety of food. They may sell Korean BBQ, funnel cakes, popcorn, and the like. It's a nice to stop by the stands to get a quick snack between classes.

Middle Earth is a bit smaller than Mesa Court, but the community is more closely knit. In Mesa court, the rooms are spacious for a dorm room. There is enough space to accommodate a bunk bed, a closet, and a medium sized desk with a chair. There is enough floorspace in a room to accommodate one or two guests relatively comfortably. The dorm mates are not the partying type, so you do not have to worry about excessive noise.', ""Though admittedly some courses are easier than others, you will be challenged either way. I cannot emphasize the need to read ahead. Most professors assume you have read the material. The professors lecture only to supplement what you know.

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college!

The food differs each day; sometimes the meal is great for lunch but for dinner it isn't. It really just depends on the day. But what is great is UC Irvine has two dining places in Middle Earth, one pippins which I just mentioned and also brandywine which has better food. It is smaller but they have good food daily and what is really awesome and what you will appreciate when you are hungry at 11 o clock at night is they stay open until midnight every night. They also have themed late night meals."", 'Dorm life is a lot of fun, you are living with around 50-90 people depending on where you are living and it makes your first year.

UC Irvine uses a quarter system with means three sets of midterms and finals which come sooner than you think. Another tip would be to join clubs and enjoy your life, it shouldn't only be about studying, you need to balance your life or you will go crazy. Lastly, be open to new adventures, opportunities, and people. The people you meet here will be with you for the rest of your life, you become close to people quickly here and you spend so much time with them whether it be tanning at the beach or studying in the library."", ""UC Irvine is definitely a stimulating and challenging school.

Yes, you can still have fun but it's also good to be studious. There are a lot of Bio Sci Majors at UCI and there are a lot of Engineering Majors, but that doesn't mean the English or Drama Major cannot get his/her moneys worth at this school. It is a very well-rounded school that not many people know about so take the time to research it.

The interactions between students and professors make the learning experience worthwhile because there are many opportunities for one to participate in research and other endeavors, such as internships.', 'One can arrange plans with friends to go to Newport Beach, which is less than 10 minute away from campus by car. A fun alternative is biking from campus to the beach, which takes approximately half an hour. One can spend a relaxing afternoon at the beach and return to campus due to its location. One can also opt to participate in active clubs that involve activities such as volunteering, sports, or movie-watching.', ""The meal plans are a bit pricey, and there aren't many variations. However, when there are special events in the dining halls, such as a major football game or holiday, the food can be extremely scrumptious. Outside of campus, there is a very limited assortment of food. There are fast food places such as In-In-Out and Chipotle, and the remaining restaurants revolve heavily on Asian Cuisine. There's nothing wrong with Asian Cuisine, but the limited, pricey options make it a bit frustrating to eat out near UCI."", 'Although the initial encounters may be awkward, the daily interactions with roommates and residents made every small moment worthwhile. The friendships that were formed made the challenges of academics more fun to handle through study groups. Escaping your comfort zone is always difficult, but once you manage to do so, it feels amazing to be outside with newly made friends. The scenery of Mesa Court, one of the Freshman Housing Areas, is serene; the resident halls are surrounded by lush lawns and trees that give the area a peaceful atmosphere. Outside of studying, there are plenty of activities to pursue while living on-campus, including basketball, volleyball, and ping pong.', ""The classes are highly demanding at UCI. However, there is a myriad of resources, such as professors, tutors, and study centers that can greatly assist you if you are struggling. It's perfectly normal if you don't understand everything the first time around, because the material is complex. Nearly everyone is studying intensely in order to master the material, yet, this doesn't mean that the material is boring. College wasn't meant to be easy; although the material is challenging, the feeling that one has upon understanding the material is astoundingly empowering."", ""One should always maintain a healthy balance between social life and academics. If you allow yourself to become overwhelmed with staying on top and ahead of others without taking a break every now and then, you'll feel extremely stressed out, and, consequently, undermine the fun opportunities there are around you, including club activities. Always study hard, but make room for some downtime. Also, don't feel afraid to reach out for help; professors have flexible office hours so they can help explain concepts that may have been unclear to you during lecture. ou shouldn't feel intimidated by asking for help; the professors know their material well and are more than willing to help you understand the material"", ""One is constantly surrounded by faculty that is dedicated to enriching your learning experience by having accessible office hours . There is a warm atmosphere around the campus, for there aren't many cliques that make one feel out of place; rather, many people, including staff and students, are amiable with one another.

Upon arriving at UCI, I took a campus tour and during this tour I knew that I was going to be learning something new every day from the students and from the faculty. For example, did you know that there are 1100+ trees planted in the center of our school (Aldrich Park)? I had no idea! Taking the time out of the day to notice things of beauty like the structure of our campus has made me realize how thankful I am to be learning something new every day. I never walk out of a class empty-handed and wishing I had actually learned something.

After some searching, I found my niche in two places: the Cross Cultural Center and the Public Health Association. I am determined now more than ever that I will be able to find more places that will make UCI my home. I enjoy it more now than I did before because I know now that I am not alone in trying to find my footing. The park, which I mentioned before, called Aldrich Park is located in the heart of UCI and without it, I would not have had some of the best conversations with other students and friends! It is so beautiful and relaxing. I also enjoy the fact that there are so many different places to eat and the Student Center is always bustling with people!

There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing a college search and seeing what your top choices are. Are you looking for a place that is bursting at the seems with stuff to do and is not focused on academics? Or are you looking for a place that is safe and maybe close to the beach? Those things are important to take into account because you not only want to take into account the academia of your school but also the extracurricular stuff and the location of the college!

Also, the school provides a huge gym free to students ( with paid tuition) that definitely motivates many to get in shape. There are sporting events year-round that students can attend to help represent that anteater spirit! When looking for a little outside fun Disneyland, Knott's, 2 shopping centers and Newport Beach are all at about 25 minutes away."", 'If you dorm at UCI you will never go hungry. The food provided at Commons is different every day and will satisfy any culinary palate. If you ever feel like having something different there are several restaurants on campus such as Subway, Panda Express, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, and across the street from campus there are many, many more! (not forgetting that there is always food being sold on Ring Road throughout campus as a way to fundraise money.. sometimes even free samples!)', 'UCI has two dorming facilities for freshmen, Middle Earth and Mesa. Each has its unique qualities but they are both great places to live for your first year of college. When living with 60-80 different people you learn so many new things from different cultures and make the closest friends you will have and will stay in touch with for your resting 3 years in college. If granted the opportunity and financial situations make it possible I would highly recommend dorming for a first-year college student at UCI.', 'Each new class I attended I came across professors who were super passionate about their subjects and were even more intrigued when the students were equally as passionate and would participate in class. Professors and TAs are happy to help out students when they can and can be easily reached when you need help. Having professors that are passionate about teaching makes the difference between enjoying a class and wanting to learn more about the subject even after the quarter is over.', 'Before attending any school, my tip would be to visit the campuses before making a final decision. In my personal experience having visited UCI the spring before I attended marked the time I made my final decision of attending the school. It truly makes all the difference in the world to see and feel the atmosphere of the campus you will be attending for the next four years.', ""UC Irvine is the sometimes referred to as the hidden gem of the UC system, and having attended for a year now I am convinced it is true. UCI is located in an area surrounded by a plethora of activities to partake in such as Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and many beautiful beaches. The campus itself is beautiful and geared around environmental sustainability with professors passionate about teaching and students actively engaged in their studies and the hundreds of extra-curricular activities available every quarter.""]]","University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) (UC Irvine) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Irvine-UC-Irvine/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/20654,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,249,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00283-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,892799095,892591556,HORIZONTAL,"07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 64 out of 65 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 262 Alina from Torrance, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You also need to be involved in many things in high school because they want students who are involved not someone that does nothing.

Initially my hopes were down because I'd come from the days of mini milk cartons and circle pizzas for lunch, but our cafeteria staff really adheres to the needs of us growing young folk."", ""The dorm I lived in is set up like a dorm you would see on TV: Big room, two beds, two desks, and two sets of dressers. They have dorms where you can have a separate room inside the big room, but I feel like you miss out on the real college experience. Living with another person like that enhances your interpersonal skills. My roommate and I started as complete strangers but now we're really close. And who knows you might get a roommate from Switzerland! Everyone in the dorms were friendly and sweet and each floor's RA was kind and helpful. There were never any problems."", ""The amount of easiness really depends on your major. I'm a Dental Hygiene major so I take a lot of Anatomy and Anatomy labs alonf with many Nursing and other Health Science majors. I have to admit, A&P Biology is my hardest class, but my other classes and professors teach without feelinf like you're being taught, like Sociology. ULM makes sitting in a lecture for an hour and fifteen minutes less boring. Although, i have heard horror stories about some Chemistry and Physics teachers, but all you have to do is ask around to see who to try and avoid. Studenta tell all"", ""My number 1 tip for student hopefuls would be to utilize your weekends! College isn't like high school where u spend 8 hours of your day at school. At the most you spend 6 hours in class, but college is so active you spend time doing other fun things instead of studying, I know I did. Though it sounds boring, students must learn to use their free time on weekends to study. Another tip is to get involved. Don't overload yourself with extracurriculars, but if you can handle a lot of clubs and organizations go for it. The people you meet and connect with are amazing. Especially at ULM. I've gotten so many new friends and study partners from being in student organizations and believe me, study partners are the bee's knees!"", ""If you want to go to a school where your teachers challenge you academically then you should pick ULM. This school has taught me a lot about pushing myself and about independence. The faculty and even the students treat us like family and are all big on helping others; they're willing to work with you when they can.""]]",University of Louisiana at Monroe Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Louisiana-Monroe/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/55429,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,17,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00283-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,892842103,892792095,HORIZONTAL,"01/19/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 18 out of 18 people found this review useful. 1 of 56 Emily from Hammond, LA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The campus is a smaller university than LSU and even LA Tech, but that is what makes it so great. It does not take very long at all to walk across campus to my classes. It is also a campus that is very pleasing to the eye. A large majority of the buildings are new and there is also a bayou that runs right through the middle of campus. The fellow students are very nice and love to make new friends. You would have to try very hard to come to ULM and not make any friends.

Het Duitse merk MySizeÃ‚Â is een fabrikant die condooms in de maten 47 tot 69 maakt. MySize condooms zijn verkrijgbaar in verpakkingen van 3 en 10 condooms, en ook in voordelige grootverpakking van 36 condooms. Wil je op zoek naar andere merken en typen condooms? Noteer dan de Nominale breedte (getal van 47 t/m 69) van het eerst voorgestelde condoom, en zoek dan verder in onze condoomwinkel naar condooms met deze maat. In de tweede kolom staat de condoommaat (nominale breedte) welke het best past bij jouw omtrek Zoek in de eerste kolom de omtrek van je penis op.Ã‚Â  Als je de omtrek van de penis in erectie hebt gemeten (ongeveer halverwege de panis), kun je in de onderstaande tabel kijken. Stap 2: Kies de juiste condooms bij jouw maat Ã‚Â  Net als in een schoenwinkel zul je eerst moeten opmeten welke maat je hebt. Om de penismaat te bepalen is de omtrek het meest belangrijk. De omtrek van de penis bepaalt welke Nominale Breedte je condoom ongeveer moet hebben (de Nominale Breedte is de breedte van een condoom als deze plat op tafel ligt). Daarnaast speelt ook de lengte van de penis een rol,Ã‚Â  maar die is iets minder belangrijk. Met de condoommeter die je hier gratis kunt downloaden kun je","MySize Paspakketten bevatten 3 verschillende maten condooms zodat je zelf kunt ervaren welke maat condoom het prettigst voor je is.Ã‚Â  Waarom is de penisomtrek belangrijker dan de penislengte? Omtrek van condooms een condoom moet goed om de penis zitten. Als je een condoom hebt dat veel te strak zit of te klein is, dan is er een grotere kans op scheuren. Als je een condoom hebt dat veel te ruim is of losÃ‚Â zit, dan is er kans dat het condoom tijdens de seks van de penis af glijdt. Condooms die perfect passen knellen niet en zitten niet te los. Je zult dan het meest natuurlijke gevoel ervaren. Iets strakkere condooms zullen er in de meeste gevallen voor zorgen dat de erectie wat stevigerÃ‚Â is, en het kan er ook voor zorgen dat het wat langer duurt voor je een orgasme krijgt. Als je van wilde seks houdt, dan zal een condoom dat ietsje strakker zit beter op zijn plaats blijven. Iets ruimere condooms geven wat meer wrijving. Dit geeft wat meer gevoel en zal in de meeste gevallen tot een sneller orgasme leiden. Lengte condooms De lengte van condooms is minder belangrijk dan de omtrek. Immers: als het condoom te lang is voor je penis, dan rol je het gewoon niet helemaal af. Wat veel minder voorkomt is dat een condoom te kort is. Maar als dat toch het geval is, rol je 'm zo ver mogelijk over",True,0,-1,,,

XML | CSV | Download as All Senate votes use these words. But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses Ã¢Â€ÂœyeaÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœnayÃ¢Â€? when voting on the final passage of bills. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in Ã¢Â€Âœordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.Ã¢Â€? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

In 2012, the Commission adopted online public file rules for broadcast television stations that required them to post public file documents to a central, FCC-hosted online database rather than maintaining the files locally at their main studios. Now that television broadcasters have completed their transition to the online file, the Commission believes it is appropriate to commence the process of expanding the online file to other media entities to extend the benefits of improved public access to public inspection files and, ultimately, reduce the burden of maintaining these files., 283703=This document requests comments on a Petition for Rule Making filed by Red Wolf Broadcasting Corporation, proposing to amend the FM Table of Allotments, Section 73.202(b) of the Commission's Rules, by allotting Channel 233A at Sagaponack, New York, as a first local service.

For instance, the apache group [6] replaced calls to strncpy() with an internal function and noticed a performance improvement [7]. Also, the ncurses [8] package recently removed an occurrence of strncpy(), resulting in a factor of four speedup of the tic utility. It is our hope that, in the future, more programmers will use the interface provided by strlcpy() rather than using a custom interface. To get a feel for the worst-case scenario in comparing strncpy() and strlcpy(), we ran a test program that copies the string ``this is just a test'' 1000 times into a 1024 byte buffer. This is somewhat unfair to strncpy(), since by using a small string and a large buffer strncpy() has to fill most of the buffer with NUL characters. In practice, however, it is common to use a buffer that is much larger than the expected user input. For instance, pathname buffers are MAXPATHLEN long (1024 bytes), but most filenames are significantly shorter than that. The averages run times in Table 1 were generated on an HP9000/425t with a 25Mhz 68040 CPU running OpenBSD 2.5 and a DEC AXPPCI166 with a 166Mhz alpha CPU also running OpenBSD 2.5. In all cases, the same C versions of the functions were used and the times are the ``real time'' as reported by the time","As can be seen in Table 1, the timings for strncpy() are far worse than those for strcpy() and strlcpy(). This is probably due not only to the cost of NUL padding but also because the CPU's data cache is effectively being flushed by the long stream of zeroes. What strlcpy() and strlcat() are not While strlcpy() and strlcat() are well-suited for dealing with fixed-size buffers, they cannot replace strncpy() and strncat() in all cases. There are still times where it is necessary to manipulate buffers that are not true C strings (the strings in struct utmp for instance). However, we would argue that such ``pseudo strings'' should not be used in new code since they are prone to misuse, and in our experience, a common source of bugs. Additionally, the strlcpy() and strlcat() functions are not an attempt to ``fix'' string handling in C, they are designed to fit within the normal framework of C strings. If you require string functions that support dynamically allocated, arbitrary sized buffers you may wish to examine the ``astring'' package from mib software [9]. Who uses strlcpy() and strlcat()? The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions first appeared in OpenBSD 2.4. The functions have also recently been approved for inclusion in a future version of Solaris.

We found a large number of overflows due to unbounded string copies using sprintf(), strcpy() and strcat(), as well as loops that manipulated strings without an explicate length check in the loop invariant.

Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements.

Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk.

The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital.

Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing.

Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages. Formula: Total Long-Term Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Current-debt to Total Debt CURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBTCURRENT DEBT TO TOTAL DEBT shows Current Liabilities as a percent of Total Debt. Smaller firms carry proportionally higher level of current debt to total debt than larger firms. Formula: Total Current Liabilities / Total Liabilities'], ['Qtr.

The gross profit margin gives an indication on whether the average markup on goods and services is sufficient to cover expenses and make a profit. GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.
