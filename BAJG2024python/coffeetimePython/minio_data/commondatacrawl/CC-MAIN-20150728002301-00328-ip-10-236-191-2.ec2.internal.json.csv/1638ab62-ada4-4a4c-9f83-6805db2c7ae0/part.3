They recently just installed many emergency poles to quickly dispatch police to your location. There are also campus cruisers that can give you a ride if you're traveling across campus alone at night (say from the library back to your dorm). UK has a free bus service so you never have to walk far or wait too long for a ride. They also have the best-lit and most heavily travelled paths on campus marked with big blue paw prints that look like Blue's clues to help you pick the safest route if you are walking alone at night."", 'Greek life is a big part of UK. The fraternities and sororities here go beyond the stereotypical partiers and really help get involved with the community. They are a great way to meet new people, make great friends, get involved with intramural sports, and get involved in community service. Greek organizations also offer opportunities for job and internship connections and academic support. It is definitely worth at least giving a look into joining.', ""There are clubs and activities available for anyone. From student government, to political clubs, to club sports, there is something for everyone. If they don't have what you're looking for, there are easy ways to start your own club up."", 'UK is really generous with scholarships if you apply for them. They have highly ranked academics and have advisers for any academic concerns you might have. Your tuition also pays for some medical coverage at the UK student clinic, academic support through multiple departments, and more. Compared to other public schools, especially with their higher scholarship offers, Kentucky is pretty affordable and gives back a lot.', 'Football season is all about tailgating and basketball season is all about cheering on your Wildcats! While sometimes it can seem like UK is like any other SEC school and all about their athletics, there are plenty of school-sponsored events on campus during the weekends. Musicians and comedians will roll through and have a show occasionally and every weekend there is a late-night movie screening right on campus. Lexington is a big city, so there are always things to do off campus as well.', ""UK offers a wide variety of dining halls, and within them plenty of choices so you never have to eat the same thing twice in a small amount of time. The food isn't too bad at the dining halls, either. There's always a Starbucks in close proximity, and big chains like Panda Express and Subway can also be found on campus."", ""While some dorms are getting up there in age, UK is currently working on building all new dorms. They offer both traditional dorms and suites. All freshmen are offered on-campus dorm housing. The dorms aren't too cramped; there's plenty of living and closet space. Classes and food aren't too far away, either."", 'No matter what school you go to, college will always be harder than high school. Depending on your major, your new college classes may challenge you to think a lot harder and put a lot more work in. There are plenty of academic support organizations available on campus to help students with their academics, and Kentucky wants to see their students graduate in four years.', ""Look into joining a Greek organization when you get there. Greek life is a big part of UK and offers a lot of opportunities to meet new people and to get involved with community service. If it doesn't look like it's for you, get involved with K Week and find another way to get involved. It's a big school, so it is important to step out of your comfort zone and meet new people."", 'A great school with emphasis on all academics, athletics, and community involvement.

In addition, renting your books rather than buying can save you money since most books will be ones that you don't plan on keeping for the future. However, if you buy your books, you may be able to save money by selling them back if they are in good condition or if it is a book that is popular among students that the bookstore sells out of quickly.

This powerful and modern diesel engine features a service-free particle filter, making it a highly eco-efficient engine. √Ç¬† The engine delivers 285 hp (North America) and 400 Nm of torque. Maximum torque is obtained from 1500 rpm and this peak value is maintained all the way up the rev range. This results in quick acceleration and smooth driveability. The engine uses twin-scroll technology. √Ç¬† The Volvo XC70 can now be equipped with the 3.0 l 6-cylinder in-line petrol turbo engine - initially in North America and later on in Europe and Japan. The engine is optimised for high performance, low fuel consumption and low exhaust emissions. √Ç¬† The Volvo XC70 is equipped with AWD - All Wheel Drive. And - for the first time ever - the XC70 model is offered with a normally aspirated, six-cylinder engine, providing a high level of driving pleasure. As in all modern Volvo cars, the in-line six-cylinder engine is mounted transversely. This engine is extremely compact and perfectly integrated with the front structure. Driveline and chassis √Ç¬† The Volvo XC70 can be equipped with the HomeLink system. The system makes it possible to operate up to three remote controlled home devices (e.g., garage door, home alarm system, etc.) via a module integrated into the sun","√Ç¬† Diesel* Cylinders Power, bhp Torque, Nm D5 5 185 400 *The diesel engine has a turbo function. √Ç¬† The diesel- and the six-cylinder engines can be combined with Geartronic - an automatic six-speed gearbox with a manual gear changing function. √Ç¬† The chassis has been further developed, in comparison with the previous XC70 model. In addition, the model can be equipped with Volvo's advanced chassis system - Active chassis with Four-C. √Ç¬† The speed-dependent power steering (option) can be completed with a three-step adjustment function, making it possible to adjust the servo assistance and optimize road feedback. The Power Parking Brake is applied automatically, simplifying starting on uphill gradients for example. The DSTC (Dynamic Stability and Traction Control) system helps reducing the risk of skidding. √Ç¬† Hill Descent Control (HDC) regulates speed on steep downhill gradients. HDC makes it possible to drive downhill without the driver touching the brake pedal. In addition, HDC facilitates starting with a caravan on slippery surfaces, and makes it easier to launch a boat into the water.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† √Ç¬† A new aluminium wheel is available: Erakir 19"".
