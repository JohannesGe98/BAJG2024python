From there, I realized there are not many things to choose from, especially for those with dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc). I quickly got tired of eating the same few things every day, but couldn't look elsewhere as I am an on-campus student without a car. Don't get me wrong, the school attempts to switch things up by offering sushi on Mondays and Thursdays, but it's not enough variety. The cafeteria at NSU screamed mall food court and fast food to me. Good meal plans are able to accommodate every studentsÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚? needs while also providing variety and nutrition. At my old school, University of Vermont (UVM), there were over fifteen different dining locations, two of which specialize towards vegetarian students and students with gluten-allergies, respectively. Each location offered fruits and veggies while also having their own specialty, like the store called Alice's which offered breakfast sandwiches that other places didn't. By having several options to choose from, students are able to obtain nutrition from different sources without feeling as if their diet has become mundane. Being able to feed students is a difficult task especially when it comes to working around their hectic schedules. Like most students, I tend to place academics first and eat when I'm freer to, however, not all stores on campus have closing times that work about my schedule. Although some stores, such as Starbucks, are open 24/7 on campus, that isn't enough to feed my hunger as it does with thirst. I am finished with classes around 8 PM on Thursdays, so it's rather disappointing when I need to wait for the next day simply because an option I want closes too early before my class even ends. At UVM, there are dining halls specifically designed to stay open until even the early mornings to feed students who were perhaps still in class or have studied too late. By having a place to eat that stays open even past the latest possible class, students at least had a place to eat when hungry after classes. These dining halls had slightly fewer options to choose from, but still had plenty of food at the same prices. Having slightly later closing times can help feed students with night classes who have a hunger to satisfy. Now to go over the meal plan itself. I am a little bias with this topic as UVM gave students the option to choose between points or unlimited meal plans while NSU simply stuck me with a point system. Points gave students a set number of cash points on their I.D. cards to spend at college stores like cash while the unlimited meal plan allowed students to eat at fewer available locations, but to eat as much as they wanted in buffet-style cafeterias. Along with both options, there were sub-options that were essentially the same thing, but at a cheaper price to accommodate those with financial issues. For example, going on the cheaper point plan simply gives the student fewer points to spend on food, but is the cheapest plan to be on. At NSU, I was given 1300 available meal points and that was it. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, but I would've liked the freedom to choose another option. The meal planÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s price itself, however, was fair. NSU's meal plan cost me $1300 for 1300 points, an even trade. On the other hand, UVM's point system offered either 1366 points for $1707 or 1050 points for $1341. The price was a bit higher, but UVM's point plans also both included 25 blocks which allowed the student to eat at the other meal plans' locations (the buffet-styled unlimited dining halls) 25 times. Both meal plans have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to price and choice, but considering how much more I'm paying to stay at NSU, I can't help but to feel I'm not getting the right bang for my buck here. Along with the freedom of being able to choose a meal plan at UVM, it was also easy to locate food when I wanted it. The fifteen different dining locations that were nicely spread across campus which allowed students to walk less than a block before stopping in a shop that accepted their meal plan. Not having to walk very far to get a bite to eat is very beneficial for students especially for those who need to grab something quick and get to class. At NSU, the main dining area is the University Center located in the campus center. They offer the most choices there, though that doesn't mean there are many in the first place. The other dining locations for those on the meal plan are spread awkwardly throughout campus. The next dining area with the second most choices is on the complete opposite end of campus. The other choices are tiny stands that mainly offer small snacks and drinks and are dispersed in random buildings across campus. By having dining locations evenly spaced and in convenient areas for students to access, I am more likely to relieve my hunger right away by stopping in a nearby place rather than waiting for class to end and having to walk all the way to a main dining area to eat. I'm sure I'm not the only one who shares these opinions on the meal plan here at NSU, however, I'm also sure that there are people who actually enjoy the meal plan here. I can't help but to feel disappointed in NSUÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s meal plan especially when compared to the high standards of UVMÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s meal plan.

You do not necessarily need to know your plan/major, but it does help. NSU is the type of university that is quick and to the point, they give you opportunities to get out of school as quick as possible, such as the Dual Admissions program---which basically ensures that your spot is being held at the medical school of your choice, so that you are not wait-listed. When i fist started college in August I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with my future, I applied for the Nursing Program and got in... but my heart was not in that field. After speaking with my advisers and doing some research, I realized that i could do so much with a Psychology degree. I now hope to complete a four-year degree in psychology and then apply to Occupational therapy (OT) school., 436458=Nova Southeastern University's Meal Plan As a student in college, what food I am provided by my school's meal plan is important to me as this is the main source of nutrition throughout my time there. At NSU, everything may seem great at first, but thing's take a quick turn for the worse when the sudden realization of having to eat here for the entire year washes over my mind. Walking in the first time, the cafeteria has a normal-looking food court-styled setting. There is a Denny's, a Pizza Loft, and Subway, and a few other choices. From there, I realized there are not many things to choose from, especially for those with dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, gluten-free, etc). I quickly got tired of eating the same few things every day, but couldn't look elsewhere as I am an on-campus student without a car. Don't get me wrong, the school attempts to switch things up by offering sushi on Mondays and Thursdays, but it's not enough variety. The cafeteria at NSU screamed mall food court and fast food to me. Good meal plans are able to accommodate every studentsÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚? needs while also providing variety and nutrition. At my old school, University of Vermont (UVM), there were over fifteen different dining locations, two of which specialize towards vegetarian students and students with gluten-allergies, respectively. Each location offered fruits and veggies while also having their own specialty, like the store called Alice's which offered breakfast sandwiches that other places didn't. By having several options to choose from, students are able to obtain nutrition from different sources without feeling as if their diet has become mundane. Being able to feed students is a difficult task especially when it comes to working around their hectic schedules. Like most students, I tend to place academics first and eat when I'm freer to, however, not all stores on campus have closing times that work about my schedule. Although some stores, such as Starbucks, are open 24/7 on campus, that isn't enough to feed my hunger as it does with thirst. I am finished with classes around 8 PM on Thursdays, so it's rather disappointing when I need to wait for the next day simply because an option I want closes too early before my class even ends. At UVM, there are dining halls specifically designed to stay open until even the early mornings to feed students who were perhaps still in class or have studied too late. By having a place to eat that stays open even past the latest possible class, students at least had a place to eat when hungry after classes. These dining halls had slightly fewer options to choose from, but still had plenty of food at the same prices. Having slightly later closing times can help feed students with night classes who have a hunger to satisfy. Now to go over the meal plan itself. I am a little bias with this topic as UVM gave students the option to choose between points or unlimited meal plans while NSU simply stuck me with a point system. Points gave students a set number of cash points on their I.D. cards to spend at college stores like cash while the unlimited meal plan allowed students to eat at fewer available locations, but to eat as much as they wanted in buffet-style cafeterias. Along with both options, there were sub-options that were essentially the same thing, but at a cheaper price to accommodate those with financial issues. For example, going on the cheaper point plan simply gives the student fewer points to spend on food, but is the cheapest plan to be on. At NSU, I was given 1300 available meal points and that was it. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, but I would've liked the freedom to choose another option. The meal planÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s price itself, however, was fair. NSU's meal plan cost me $1300 for 1300 points, an even trade. On the other hand, UVM's point system offered either 1366 points for $1707 or 1050 points for $1341. The price was a bit higher, but UVM's point plans also both included 25 blocks which allowed the student to eat at the other meal plans' locations (the buffet-styled unlimited dining halls) 25 times. Both meal plans have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to price and choice, but considering how much more I'm paying to stay at NSU, I can't help but to feel I'm not getting the right bang for my buck here. Along with the freedom of being able to choose a meal plan at UVM, it was also easy to locate food when I wanted it. The fifteen different dining locations that were nicely spread across campus which allowed students to walk less than a block before stopping in a shop that accepted their meal plan. Not having to walk very far to get a bite to eat is very beneficial for students especially for those who need to grab something quick and get to class. At NSU, the main dining area is the University Center located in the campus center. They offer the most choices there, though that doesn't mean there are many in the first place. The other dining locations for those on the meal plan are spread awkwardly throughout campus. The next dining area with the second most choices is on the complete opposite end of campus. The other choices are tiny stands that mainly offer small snacks and drinks and are dispersed in random buildings across campus. By having dining locations evenly spaced and in convenient areas for students to access, I am more likely to relieve my hunger right away by stopping in a nearby place rather than waiting for class to end and having to walk all the way to a main dining area to eat. I'm sure I'm not the only one who shares these opinions on the meal plan here at NSU, however, I'm also sure that there are people who actually enjoy the meal plan here. I can't help but to feel disappointed in NSUÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s meal plan especially when compared to the high standards of UVMÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?s meal plan. If I were to choose a college based solely on the meal plan alone, I would choose UVM in a heartbeat; not only is their meal plan much better, but I also wouldÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚?ÃƒÂ‚?ve saved around eight grand. Not being able to eat when I want or being able to satisfy a craving because it's not available has made me view the food at NSU negatively. For a first-time college student, perhaps the food may seem exciting, but it didn't take long for me to become tired of my repetitive meal-schedule., 239252=There are brand new residence halls and the older residence halls are being completely renovated and will be finished by Fall 2012.

The full A4 photo speed is particularly impressive as this is where most cheaper printers stumble. Comparing the S750 to the S900 it printed an A4 page of text nine seconds faster, and an A4 page of colour graphics 23 seconds faster. The full A4 photo was 16 seconds faster on the S900. These small variations make little difference to most people's normal use, but it's impressive to note that a supposedly lower-end printer can outperform its superior in some areas. It also helps show that the APCDT does offer some real performance improvements. A unique feature of the S750 is the Advanced Precision Colour Distribution Technology (APCDT), which Canon say is 'the latest innovation in advanced inkjet printer design, delivering faster colour print speeds at extremely high quality levels'. This incidentally, is the reason the S750 has two sets of nozzles, and the S900 only one. Reading the technology description on the Canon web-site here this all sounds very good. However the S750 is still inferior to the S900 in terms of image quality, despite the S900 not using APCDT. The S750 uses a smaller print head to the S900 illustrated on the left. According to Canon specifications,","While maintaining these quite impressive speeds the noise produced remains at a reasonable level. It is by no means quiet, but lacks the loud clunks and whirs so common on many lower-end printers. Print quality Although perhaps a little unfair given the S750's price point, we were expecting great things. Having been impressed by the recently reviewed Canon S900 and S9000 I imagined the S750 was going to be equally impressive, relative to its price. This was not the case, initially prints suffered from severe banding. Following a head clean and re-alignment the banding was reduced making it very hard to spot. By this I mean the average person looking at a photo from an artistic point of view rather than a technical one wouldn't notice it. It's a shame this crucial process of head alignment isn't done automatically as it isn't a simple procedure for novice users. An important factor in evaluating the S750's image quality was ink drying time. Generally the prints need longer than average to reach their optimal quality even when using Canon's Photo Paper Pro. Our very dark density print looked bad straight out of the printer with some odd streaks visible in the darkest areas, but these disappeared to produce an acceptable print. Despite these negative points the S750 still manages a decent performance. Although not in the same league as the",True,0,0,,{1152=Posted : 1 May 2002 12:00AM by Will SmithÃ‚Â }

Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, HUD is publishing a proposed rule that would amend its regulations for the Section 108 Program to permit HUD to collect a fee for the Section 108 Program. 80 FR 6470 - Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program: Payment of Fees To Cover Credit Subsidy Costs GPO FDSys XML | Text Additional Documents type regulations.gov FR Doc. 2015-02262 RIN 2506-AC35",False,-1,0,"{7264=This proposed rule would amend HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108 Program) regulations to permit HUD, in accordance with statutory authority, to collect fees from Section 108 borrowers to offset the costs of Section 108 loan guarantees. HUD is proposing this rule to ensure that it can begin to make Section 108 loan guarantee commitments without appropriated subsidy. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2014, authorizes HUD to collect fees from borrowers for this program. In anticipation of further appropriations acts authorizing the collection of fees for Section 108 loan guarantees, HUD proposes to add a new section to its current regulations to reflect that when appropriations for credit subsidy costs as authorized by Congress are either not available or insufficient and HUD has statutory authority to collect fees, HUD will impose a fee on Section 108 Program borrowers and explain the basis for the fee imposed. The proposed new regulatory section would provide for HUD to set the fee by notice. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, HUD is publishing the notice that would propose the fee to be established for the fiscal year 2015, subject to statutory authorization.}","{5270=Title 24 published on 2014-04-01., 1041=Title 24 published on 2014-04-01}"
