A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it.

There is nothing in college except for the college, a gas station, a bar, and apartments. We had a few restaurants off campus, but they were burnt down this year unfortunately due to a kitchen fire. They are working on rebuilding the restaurants, and they will be ready by 2016. Outside of Cullowhee, is this town called Sylva. There is a lot of places to eat in town but mostly fast food restaurants. You will find a Walmart, banks, Ingles, Food lion, a bowling alley, a small movie theatre, and small shops. Downtown is kind of fun, if you want to spend the day walking around, going to a coffee shop, and just relaxing. So the question is what to do for fun. You have to make great friends, this will come easy because the school is small. You'll probably go to many bon-fires with your friends, off of campus. You may spend your night by a fire, laying on a hammock, and grilling out. You'll go hiking, and when I say hiking I mean vigorous hiking. A lot of the trails are for experienced people but there is also a lot of easy ones. There is a total of seven near by waterfalls that you can find, and go on an adventure while you are there. You'll go to college sporting events and show your catamount pride. Our football team may not be the best, but were pretty much great at every other sport. You'll probably spend a lot of time looking at each other figuring out what to do. Small parties are more popular here than huge parties. If your over 21, you will probably go to the bar a lot. If your under 21, you better be careful and not get caught under age drinking! There are many parties, but you will figure out which ones are safe and which ones are not. A lot of people join Greek Life to make friends and have stuff to do. You don't have to join Greek Life in order to be involved in school, but if you have a hard time making friends I would do it. You'll also probably visit places like Cherokee (15 min away) and Gatlinburg (45 min away)."", 'There is a lot to choose from on campus! There is a chickfila, papa johns, a small sushi place that has it prepackaged. There is also a smoothie place, a burger joint, panda express, Einstiens bagel shop, McCalisters. The upstairs dining hall is the best. This is a buffet style dining hall and you will really get your moneys worth. You can eat as much as you want, for a low cost. They are usually always open and also stay open for late night dining on the weekends.', ""I consider the dorm life to be pretty good! There are many dorms just for freshman but most freshman spend their first year in Scott dorm. This dorm does not have AC but it does have a huge fan on the window. This really isn't an issue unless you take summer classes, then you may get hot. Overall, the dorms are small but you have many options. In most dorms, you can choose to have a suite style dorm (this means you only share a bathroom and get your own room!) or you have the option of bunking with someone. Again, the rooms are small so if I were you, I would get a room to yourself. Some of dorms are loud, depending where on campus they are located. The freshman dorms are the loudest, especially on the weekends. A lot of the freshman, go crazy there first year, and overdose in their dorms. Don't be surprised if you see EMS outside your window. Get into the honors college, and stay in the Blue Ridge dorm (I believe that is what it is called). If you do this, its all studious people who actually care about school and are super quiet."", ""This really depends on your major and what you consider hard. Your teachers will have very high standards, that they expect you to meet! Your teachers will not joke about attendance policies and will take it quite seriously. Example, miss three days of class and this is an automatic B (again this depends on your major). I think the classes seem easier because your in a small class. Your teacher has time to speak with you directly in class and answer all of your questions. Your teachers are also always available during office hours and have time to meet with you everyday because they don't have to worry about 3,000 students a day. Take your work seriously though because you can get a high enough GPA and get into the honors college. Lastly, do plan on writing many papers, and spending your evenings in the library. But its okay, there is a Java City to keep you motivated and moving!"", 'If you are going to attend Western Carolina University, then you need to get involved in clubs! There are so many clubs to choose from and you will make friends quickly. Also, do not spend a lot of money on winter gear. Prior to coming to Western Carolina University, my mother spend so much money on winter coats, boots, etc. The winters here are mild and you will only have snow sometimes and the roads will always be cleared. Live on campus your first year, you may hate the freshman college dorms because there is not AC but you will live. You will make life long friends in Scott dorm and become close to great people. Also, eat upstairs in the dining hall! Students tend to not want to eat up here because ordering panda express, or papa johns is easier. At the dining hall, you can eat as much as you would like, and you get your moneys worth. Lastly, if you are a freshman, leave your car at home! There is absolutely terrible parking at western. You probably wont even use your car here, unless you are taking a trip to Walmart. Your friends will most likely have a car and you can car pool.', 'Western Carolina University, the best underrated college in North Carolina. Wake up to beautiful scenery, and walk to class, where your class sizes will be small, you will make the best friends, and enjoy studying by the tower. Western Carolina University is your school, if you enjoy the outdoors, want to be taught by teachers who have PHDS, in a class setting of thirty or less, and you are okay with not living in a city.']]",Western Carolina University (WCU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Carolina-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/71436,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,107,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00224-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,887341391,887246366,HORIZONTAL,"{519988=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 439055=Campus safety is amazing.
