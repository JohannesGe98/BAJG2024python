Missouri actually wins this game more often than not (57.4% of the time), despite being outscored on average. In 2007, this was supposed to be a great game, and it was a good game. In 2008, with the Big Twelve North title and a spot in the Big Twelve Championship Game on the line, this is a great game. With the score going one way and the win percentage going the other, this is as close as we get to a toss-up. We say that Missouri moves on, loses to Oklahoma the next week (sound familiar?) but then still makes a BCS bowl. Game of the Week: #15 Kansas 34.8 (8-3) @ #9 Missouri 34.2 (10-2) Today we preview Week 14. Games for each week are ordered by winning percentage of the home team descending, with the score reading the visitors first and then the home team. If a team is listed as having a 95% chance of winning, that means that it won at 95% or more of the 1,000 simulations. Every underdog has a chance to win. Along those lines, this may be relatively obvious for some examples (i.e. LSU vs. Appalachian State), but non-FBS rosters and ratings are not maintained individually due to lack of data.
