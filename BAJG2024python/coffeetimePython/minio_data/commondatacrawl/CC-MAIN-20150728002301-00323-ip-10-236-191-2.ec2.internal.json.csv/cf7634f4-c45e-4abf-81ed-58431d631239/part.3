If you dorm on-campus, activities in the dorm can help you have financially cheap fun. There's plenty of transit around such as the subway and the bus so if one wanted to go in the city they would fine no problem. For the extra-curricular students, there are plenty of organizations to join such as Greek life, the radio station, Fashion Club and many other ethnic or event driven clubs. There also is an active volunteer service on the different campuses. There are off and on-campus parties, but there is a strict no alcohol policy on campus. Am learning a lot Thanks to the professors, St. John's is a school that helps students for their particular career field. Many of the teachers have had experience in your field, so they are willing to give you tips that go a long way. This college is not for the slacker- expect to do work, but in the end it helps out. Many students go onto graduate school in the city or receive internships after they graduate. Some even participate in internships while they are in undergraduate school.

Many of the teachers have had experience in your field, so they are willing to give you tips that go a long way. This college is not for the slacker- expect to do work, but in the end it helps out.

Mostly people go off campus to party. Nearby there are frat house parties, fun bars (Traditions, Cheapshots, McFaddens, etc), and some clubs. Farther off, i work at and attend manhattan clubs and have been to legit brooklyn raves. All are really fun. Now this is an undeniable fact. St. John's is nearby the big apple but it isn't right next door. Be prepared for 30-50 minute traveling, depending on where you are going. Thoug, to me, i've been to manhattan so often it doesn't even seem that far anymore. From the top of the Great Stairs and some buildings there is a perfect view of manhattan which i love sitting down and viewing. There are alot of beautiful landscaping and trees. The campus is escpecially beautiful in the springtime.

One week in February or March it was 70 degrees one day, 40 degrees after, snow the next, 60 the next, and rain with a violent random slushy thunderstorm for like two hours the next day.

What was interesting was that while i was there, some other big colleges, one being University of Delaware, were actually renting out our Rome campus and while my class were all freshmen, the students coming from the other colleges were Juniors and Seniors! If you are a singer like me, or some kind of musician, there are definately opportunities. Manhattan definately has music opportunities, and being so close to it has its advantages.

New York is one of the best cities in the world. There is always something to do. Sometimes activities in the city can cost so much. I like the school's offices because they offer so many things for a fraction of the cost. Musicals can range from 10- 30 dollars which is not bad at all considering the real price of a seat on Broadway. Sometimes different events are held on school such as cultural events, art events. Special guest speakers are frequently coming in. My favorite are the talent showcases which are also held frequently. Everything from open mic night to poetry showcases are displayed."", 'The food is great. One of the best things I enjoy being away from college is the food. In the cafeteria the workers are there to get anything you like. If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see in the cafeteria they would take it into consideration. For example many people were asking for an ice cream machine and we got one. Snacks that we like were also added to the cafeteria. I also did not know until I compared it with other schools is that they make what you ask them to make. A lot of my friends go to school where they can only eat the food they see in front of them. We actually get to pick the things we like and the workers prepare it right there in front of you.', 'Dorm life is not as hard as I thought it would be. It really helps you become more independent. Yet again it all depends on the circumstances. I would say that it is important to be organized and responsible for your own stuff. Also it is very important to establish rules with your roommates. I have had instances where roommates want to throw a party but I have class the next day. Make sure you let them know ahead of time that you are comfortable with this but not that. You are paying to live there so you have a right to live comfortably. Now that you are away from home you have to take care of some of the responsibilities that your parents take. You might not be paying bills but you are cooking and cleaning for yourself. It is important to stay clean so that you can set the example for your other roommates if they are not. And once again never feel afraid to tell them when something is bothering you.', 'The first year of college was not hard academic wise. I honestly found myself working harder in high school. It is not to say that it will never be challenging. As you continue your years in college it becomes challenging but it is actually a good thing. I found myself wanting harder classes by my second year in college. In order to be the best you have to really challenge yourself. If you continue to take classes for the grade you will never feel fully satisfied. It becomes boring. Professors at St. John aim to challenge you to the best of your abilities. Some professors are harder than others but at the end of the class you find yourself thanking them. Without them you would have never realized that you are capable of some things.', ""I would say always keep in mind that are professors are there to help you. Never hesitate to ask someone for help. Don't be too scared the first year. I would say that my first year was actually the most fun year. The second thing is organization. Organization is a big key in college especially for students going away to college. You are pretty much in charge of everything. You make your own schedule, you decide what organizations to become part of and ultimately what career choice you want to take. Its important to stay organized so you don't fall behind in your classes.

Many of the teachers have had experience in your field, so they are willing to give you tips that go a long way. This college is not for the slacker- expect to do work, but in the end it helps out. Many students go onto graduate school in the city or receive internships after they graduate. Some even participate in internships while they are in undergraduate school.

Am enjoying being here There's plenty to do on the weekends and during the week. If you dorm on-campus, activities in the dorm can help you have financially cheap fun. There's plenty of transit around such as the subway and the bus so if one wanted to go in the city they would fine no problem.

Your experience in college depends on what you put in, so try to have fun once in a while. 8) Definitly do Study Abroad! It is offered to all of the students here, and I must say that if you do not take advantage of this opportunity, it is a little pointless to come here. Many other schools do NOT offer this opportunity to all of their students, so I strongly believe that everyone that goes here should take advantage of everything that this school has to offer. 9) Take advantage of the Career Center.

If you dorm on-campus, activities in the dorm can help you have financially cheap fun. There's plenty of transit around such as the subway and the bus so if one wanted to go in the city they would fine no problem. For the extra-curricular students, there are plenty of organizations to join such as Greek life, the radio station, Fashion Club and many other ethnic or event driven clubs. There also is an active volunteer service on the different campuses. There are off and on-campus parties, but there is a strict no alcohol policy on campus. Am learning a lot Thanks to the professors, St. John's is a school that helps students for their particular career field. Many of the teachers have had experience in your field, so they are willing to give you tips that go a long way. This college is not for the slacker- expect to do work, but in the end it helps out. Many students go onto graduate school in the city or receive internships after they graduate. Some even participate in internships while they are in undergraduate school.

There are also alot of clubs to join. be prepared for your school email account to be filled with constant messges of activities. A good amount of people go home on the weekend so sometimes the campus seems like a ghost town. party wise is tricky. St. John's University is a dry campus, meaning we aren't allowed to have alcohol or drugs on campus, but people drink, sell, and smoke weed anyways, just in secret. Mostly people go off campus to party. Nearby there are frat house parties, fun bars (Traditions, Cheapshots, McFaddens, etc), and some clubs. Farther off, i work at and attend manhattan clubs and have been to legit brooklyn raves. All are really fun. Now this is an undeniable fact. St. John's is nearby the big apple but it isn't right next door. Be prepared for 30-50 minute traveling, depending on where you are going. Thoug, to me, i've been to manhattan so often it doesn't even seem that far anymore. From the top of the Great Stairs and some buildings there is a perfect view of manhattan which i love sitting down and viewing. There are alot of beautiful landscaping and trees. The campus is escpecially beautiful in the springtime. If you don't live in New York, be prepared for it's wheather especially when it's transitioning between seasons, then things really start to get crazy. One week in February or March it was 70 degrees one day, 40 degrees after, snow the next, 60 the next, and rain with a violent random slushy thunderstorm for like two hours the next day. Spring didn't really begin to show itself til late April/early May When it's nice out, music is playing, some people are tanning on the lawn, and EVERYBODY is outside.

Public safety driving around, emergency stations, but personally i have walked off campus to 7/11 and Dunkin Donuts (a block away from the campus) in the middle of the nite, i was perfectly fine. we all get a free laptop, a fair amount of computer stations. Study Abroad is fantastic. St. John's has campuses in Rome, Italy and Paris, France. With a whole bunch of opportunities to visit many other countries. I attended the freshman Passport Program, in January. i was lucky enough to be in Italy for 2 weeks and enjoyed every second of it, especially since we had alot of free time to explore, travel, and shop on our own. What was interesting was that while i was there, some other big colleges, one being University of Delaware, were actually renting out our Rome campus and while my class were all freshmen, the students coming from the other colleges were Juniors and Seniors! If you are a singer like me, or some kind of musician, there are definately opportunities. Manhattan definately has music opportunities, and being so close to it has its advantages. I have a friend who had his first gig in manhattan, another friend, who is a musical prodigy, just got signed. Heck, J. Cole and Kris Payne were from St. John's.

I'd like to recommend Ultimate Frisbee for a great time :)"", ""The 6 college system may seem daunting at first, which one will be best for you? Definitely read up on the colleges' general ed class requirements and your major requirements, some will match up perfectly and will be convenient. I, on the other hand, did not do this. I'm an engineering major in Thurgood Marshall College (which is geared toward humanities) so I'm taking many classes that will only make my stay at UCSD longer. Nonetheless I've made the most of my situation and am enjoying myself. Also look into financial aid, because I've had my need almost completely met each year, and they are always a big help. Oh and if living on campus: bring a bike, the campus is HUGE."", 'Although its cheaper to get general classes out of the way at a community college first, I feel like I would have really missed out on the transitioning with other freshman on campus. It is a learning experience that takes living in the dorms and struggling to get priorities in order with others at the same time. Its totally worth it, in my opinion :)', ""I do feel the 6 college system is sometimes a burden when I have friends in other colleges. It makes it difficult to meet up as often as I'd like, but I manage. You will meet a ton of diverse people from different backgrounds, and there is always something fun to do as long as you keep your mind open and actually attend events. Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones!"", ""Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

They crown a Watermelon Queen (either gender), and they get to drop a watermelon off the roof of a building, aiming at a target on the ground. There is a small concert venue called the Che Cafe. There are many private concerts with beginner bands. It looks like a run-down shack, but the ambiance is comfortable and fun., 1048930=La Jolla Beach UTC Gas Lamp District Seaworld Mission Bay Old Town San Diego Balboa Park Del Mar Coronado Island, 880118=On campus, there are the gym facilities. Again like the food I would get off campus for the really world class recreation. If you are into martial arts, San Diego has a really famous fight community. Black House gym is right up Miramar Road and ATOS jiu jitsu is on Convoy. If you are more of a water sports type, the beach is a 5 minute walk away from the campus, 1126001=Great on Academics, mediocre on campus life, and truly terrible for students with disabilities. Parking for the handicapped is sparse, the transportation programs often make you late to class, and the Office for Students with Disabilities, while mainly staffed with great people, has a lady by the name of April Garrison who is evidently fond of making students obtain thousands of out of pocket dollars of extra testing despite the fact that they have doctors who state that they are in need of assistance. When I told her I did not have that kind of money, she callously suggested that I add to my already crippling student debt and borrow it. Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre. You get the eventual hair in your food or find something that doesnt look appetizing, but hey, its a cafeteria. Just t mention, Revelle will be going through cafeteria renovation, so for the 2013-2014 school year, we will not have a cafeteria., 853203=There are plenty of interesting locations around campus. There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College. Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,
"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', 'Students who like to get the most out of education and life itself and want to be happy and feel at home in a great community.

Utilize the resources this school has to offer. There are plenty of tools and opportunities, no excuses to not be having the time of your life in all respects!', ""With all I've said so far, I would hope that you would feel like you get your bang for the buck. Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!! Where else can you get such hands-on experience. San Diego is such a diverse city, culturally and scientifically, it is rich with job opportunities, so what better way to get a head start than in La Jolla! Port Triton (our mascot is King Triton) is a useful site that can help you with your resume and applying for jobs, and don't worry, if research isn't your thing, there are other jobs too =) So doing the research isn't the only cool thing here, you can also be a SUBJECT by participating in research studies. Because there are so many studies going on, they are desperately looking for college students' help! And more often than not, this means COLD, HARD CASH in your pocket! A friend of mine got 90 buckaroos for answering some questions about how she doesn't smoke cigarettes! Like a forty minute interview, and a couple of short surveys, and BAM! If that isn't as easy as it gets, then I don't know what is! There is also the beautiful SCRIPPS institute. If you come to UCSD, definitely check it out sometime. When our legendary, Geisel Library gets crowded during finals week you can go to the SCRIPPS library and get a balcony facing the ocean with your friends, something about watching the water while you study is just pure amazement. So a couple of things I might note are that in some resident halls Internet can be rather laggy so sometimes you move around or go to the lounge on your floor for better access (oh ya, at least in Warren College, each floor of the dorms has its own study lounge). And the second is the pricey food. So when you pay your tuition, you pay a certain amount of money to be put on your card called dining dollars. It is a VERY convenient means of paying for you meals, snacks and other non-food related items at the convenience store from curling irons to foil. However, you'll find that basically everything is probably double what it should cost (i.e.- a loaf of bread being nearly 6 bucks). So while you really don't feel the pain of paying for it because it is a prepaid card that you just swipe, it is frustrating to think how much we pay in our tuition for it. I've heard rumors of people running out of money, but I'll tell you, my suitemates and I have more than enough dining dollars. A lot of times we use our abundance of cash for decorations for the dorms and other fun stuff. Overall I definitely do prefer our system over others. Our cards can be used to eat at any of the dining halls. You can put money in a separate account on the card for other food places like the frozen yogurt shop, or for the laundry rooms. I know other UC's use a different method, like you get a certain amount of meals per week not money to spend yourself. And if you don't use those meals you can't save them up or anything to buy something else later."", ""I am not just enjoying being here, I am LOVING it!!! What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy. There are plenty of dances strategically planned around midterms and what not to provide a little extra entertainment. La Jolla is a beautiful area too, so a beach trip is never out of the question. One of my favorite things last quarter that we did was walk out to the beach (like a 20 minute walk depending where on campus you are-we were on the farthest side). It was like midnight when we left, it was so much fun walking out in the middle of the night together. We went to the cliffs where it was dark and you could hear the waves crashing. That night there was a GORGEOUS meteor shower. It was the perfect location, HUGE bright streaks filled the sky, I'll never forget that night. I would definitely say your college experience is what you make of it. If you want to have fun, trust me you will. Perhaps one of the greater things about UCSD is the 6-college system. Going to a huge university can definitely be overwhelming, however what is unique about our school is that it has six smaller campuses divided up within the university. Each has its own motto and general ed requirements (do a little research before applying). So you sleep in the dorms at your college (which I highly recommend living ON campus, by the way), however, you go to class throughout the school. What this does, is provide an opportunity for a little more intimacy within each campus. You get to know the people around you a lot easier, and you share something in common with them. And a lot of the time, each college has particular majors that gravitate toward it (mostly because of the gen ed requirements). There is some friendly competition among the six colleges too. Spirit Week is a blast during winter quarter when each campus tries to rack up as many points as possible in showing school spirit. Side note: go to the games, there lots of fun! The other cool thing is that each campus has it's own dining hall and convenience store. Goody's (best burritos ever) is open until 1am and so is foodworks (make your own pizzas) the rest of the dining halls close at about 8pm. And the convenience stores are open until the convenient hour of 1am (when me and my suitemates find we most often need those last minute study snacks). The gym...well, quite frankly, I love it. RIMAC to be precise. It is a massive gym with the most beautiful locker room you ever did lay eyes on. There are plenty of elliptical machines (my personal favorite) and lots of racquetball courts. Along with the usual gym stuff. There are lots of recreational classes offered there (unfortunately you have to pay), but lots of clubs utilize the gym for free too (i.e.-dance). We have an indoor pool in Main Gym and I've seen a jacuzzi, but never anyone in it. If you have any religious affiliation, there are plenty of clubs to enhance your spirtuality too. We have cute cafes and a 24 hour library CLICS during finals week. UCSD definitely provides the tools for a well balanced life outside of school work =)"", ""UCSD provides excellent professors to optimize learning for its students...for the most part anyway. Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed. The students here are crazy smart so there can be a lot of competition, however it is not impossible to get an A in most classes if you put in the effort. Professors like Christina Johnson, who teaches Gen Chem, are absolutely AMAZING and show the deepest concern for their student's success. I particularly recommend taking her if you need to take the Chem 6 series.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,2,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Once accepted, be sure to get involved with the campus and the community through on or off-campus organizations the experience is very rewarding both in terms of service to the community and personal fulfillment or future career preparation. In addition, since UCSD operates on the quarter system, classes move incredibly fast. Before you know it, you will be taking your first midterm. A particularly useful strategy is to push hard during the first couple of weeks and then ease off afterwards; and, go to the library! The result is a high level of academic achievement in the beginning that will give you the momentum you need to finish off the quarter strong. Above all, remember that even though you are in a competitive university with even more competitive peers competing for highly competitive degrees in order to matriculate into competitive careers or graduate schools, take a break once in a while and grab coffee, run out to the cliffs and watch the sunset, or just have some pain old fun. If these years are truly our best, then itГў\x80\x99s equally important to enjoy ourselves and make the most of our college experience.', 'As for quality of education as well as housing, the university offers it at a very reasonable price. In fact, nearly all of the mandatory fees paid towards to university are reasonable with much of it coming back to benefit the student in the forms of organizations, additional programming, and rock concerts. For instance, gym membership and access to all other recreational facilities are guaranteed to the student at prices that are quite reasonable as compared to other campuses. In addition, after the student activity fee referendum ran by the ASUCSD passed last year, entering students will not see another fee increase for four years. The only place that students will have difficulty in handling financially is dining. This is partly because Housing and Dining is not under the direct jurisdiction of the campus but is rather an affiliated business operating within UCSD. In terms of business, then, there is a certain amount of profiteering is expected. The most troubling thing is the allocation of two meals a day (or eleven dollars) and the separate food items contributing towards a full meal costing sixteen dollars in total. The result is many students not being able to eat a full meal (that is, an entrГѓВ©e, drink, and a dessert) and running out of dining dollars early; the dining halls do not operate buffet style. Moreover, certain dining halls such as Plaza CafГѓВ© in Revelle College frequently run out of items towards the end of the academic year and occasionally have slight issues with hygiene such as having fruit flies in the salad bar. However, that is not to say that there is not quality food on campus. Most other dining halls offer quality food and, even for Plaza CafГѓВ©, the issue of insanitation is only an occasional problem.', 'Absolutely, UCSD is, by far, a place to be enjoyed. The integrated six-college system in this rather large campus caters to both students wanting the large campus experience or a small-town college feel. Regardless, the six-college system (especially for incoming freshman) creates a sense of community helping to create a very positive atmosphere where students learn, work, or even pass around the Frisbee. Moreover, the campus infrastructure and location offers the convenience of providing everything a student needs at a high level of quality -- work, food, or a good wave at the beach before a Friday-night get party -- right at oneГў\x80\x99s fingertips. UCSD is, then, the perfect place to be, right? Not quite. You see, there are a few problems one would encounter here, especially if one is looking for school spirit. With the absence of a football team and an incredible drive for academic excellence from a majority of the students (which isnГў\x80\x99t a bad thing at all), UCSD pride does suffer a bit. However, that isnГў\x80\x99t to say there is no spirit at all as evident in the number of events held by the athletics department as well as student organizations to promote school spirit. Overall, then, UCSD is a great place to be.', ""Overall, the quality of UCSD's education system is exceptional. By offering a large variety of classes and majors, one will definitely find a specific major with classes oriented for the individual or have the privilege to sample everything that is out there. In addition, the majority of the professors (especially those teaching in upper division courses) are outstanding, taking a keen interest in the success of a student not only in the course but also in the student developing into a complete scholar. Furthermore, class structure and content are usually engaging, which helps a great deal with the learning process. However, there are a few minor issues. If one wishes to participate in additional educational programs such as a class for Emergency Medical Technicians or perhaps have a taste of the military life, this is a campus that offers no such services. But aside from this minute inadequacy, this is undoubtedly a university that will teach the necessary knowledge and skills for success.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,3,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt.

If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""People who are truly committed to growing as leaders, learning as much as possible, and being involved through the countless organizations. People say that UCSD is boring and anti social, but folks, the truth is the total opposite. First quarter I admit that I was pretty lonely with nothing much to do, but I got involved in organizations and in my phage course and things changed a lot. Like I mentioned before I love to dance so I joined the Folklorico club. I also wanted to do a sport so I joined Women's Crew. UCSD is a great place for meeting those who share so so much in common with you while having tons of fun at the same time. I'd say UCSD truly defines what the ultimate college experience should be, one just has to open the doors."", ""Ok so first things first, check out all the colleges! Before picking your top 3 do your research. You don't want to be taking classes that don't really interest you or those you think won't interest you. I'm in Muir College and I picked it for its Environmental Theme, thus my major Environmental Systems, Chemistry. I like that it is also the college closest to the beach and with the most beautiful view of the ocean. I like the intimacy and comfort that it brings and the convenience of the main gym next door. But in terms of the general education classes, they are the most flexible so if you want to double major or major and minor then there should be no problem, in my opinion. Choose the right college for the right focus. ERC focuses on international studies and like studies, Revelle focuses on science for the most part, if you want to be an engineer choose Warren. Now for other things, bring a bicycle, or if you skate, bring a skateboard. The campus is pretty large and unless you want to speed walk like I had to do the entire winter quarter, bring some mode of transportation. Bring a little refrigerator if you are living in the residential areas. The apartments already have a fridge, but the residential dorms do not. If you are going to be living in a triple a mini refrigerator is essential. It'll make your life easier; it made my life a lot easier. Go to class! There is not point in skipping class, what else are you going to do! Unless it's SunGod then you have no excuse. Or if you have an 8 am class and it's already spring quarter, then maybe I'll cut you some slack. But seriously go to lecture and office hours and discussion. You might have a question to ask and it is very important to get it answered so you won't fall behind."", ""Yes, the financial issue is getting tougher each year and this year I find myself getting a larger loan than the one I did last year. I predict that for the years to come those loans will get larger. To save money I did take my social sciences classes at a community college this summer. I am nearly finished with my general education classes and am looking forward to taking courses for my major this next fall. I am big on money saving and always find ways to do things economically but nonetheless I value my education very highly. Of course college is expensive but UCSD is the best choice for me because of my interests in career choices and because of the vast amount of educational opportunities offered. Yes, I worry about how much money I'll owe once I graduate but one must look for scholarships, grants, and other forms of aid. Though I must say I've been blessed with the amount I've received both this year and last. If you got in already don't give up this grand opportunity, trust me, you will not regret accepting."", ""UCSD is a particular place where one gets what one wants. In other words if you want to join a sorority or fraternity then you can, and with it all the good stuff that you want, if you know what I mean. If you want to live a calm, relaxed life, then you can as well. One makes college what one wants. There are organizations that will appeal to everyone and the more one is involved the happier one lives. The social climate is quite peaceful; for some it's boring, but for others it is perfect. When one wants to study without having to be interrupted then one has no problem in doing so. We have to find where all the commotion is. I personally love to dance, and close by there is Tango Del Rey for 18 and over. I went for the Folklorico Social and fell in love with it. For those who appreciate ethnic music and dance, this is the place to go and it is only about 10 minuates away from campus. And I restate that you just have to look for it. But the good thing is that if you want to have fun, there is no problem looking for it. And when you want to study and focus, there is no problem either. It's that simple."", ""I applied for the Phage Genomics Initiative Course offered to only freshman, while I was still a senior. Those of you who are enrolled in this freshman research class should be stoked because it is truly an exciting class to take. It opened my eyes to the much needed research in not only microbiology but other science fields as well. I learned about electron microscopy and about different dna annotating programs. It was truly a once in a life time experience and it further encouraged me to pursue my goal of becoming a researcher. I pretty much only took math and chem courses my freshman year. I learned a lot not only in lecture, but from the TA office hours and Professor office hours. I also took advantage of the Summer Bridge Program and Academic Transition Program which extended throughout the whole year. Here I took math and chemistry workshops in addition to going to lecture and discussion. There are tutors available even if one is not enrolled in the workshops. These workshops are like extra classes and are two hours long two times a week, so you can see that I was very busy. The truth is one is going to need help some day and if studying with your best friend isn't going to get you anywhere go to OASIS which is located in Center Hall third floor and go early because spaces fill up fast! I don't want to scare you but in these tough times one must know in advance what field one wants to focus on. I personally don't like wasting time switching majors from one field to an entirely different one where the classes won't overlap or transfer to the new major. That's money and time we're talking about and if you are completely clueless on what you want to major in, go to the Career Services Center as early as possible for tips and help on choosing the right field.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Also, check to see if your intended major is impacted because if it is you should declare it on the application.

UCSD does offer academic help at every corner: there are always professor and TA office hours, OASIS (itГў\x80\x99s like taking another class on that subject but in a small group environment), labs (for math and chemistry where you can get questions answered), and you can always form your own study groups. And remember, college is supposed to be fun! Work hard so you can play hard!', 'This was my compromise school because what it came down to was money. I was leaning towards a private institution which would have cost around $40,000+ a year! I did receive financial aid (IГў\x80\x99m speaking of financial aid in terms of money I donГў\x80\x99t need to pay back) from that school but it wasnГў\x80\x99t enough to compare to the price of a UC school, which did not offer me financial aid. Comparing the two schools, the value of the education at UCSD was on par with that of the private institution and for half the price! But be weary, the UC Regents recently voted for a 32% fee increase, which in the near future (~2-3 yrs.) will mean you are paying more for less resources, so remember to do the math!', 'There is a stereotype about UCSD that makes the school appear anti-social. IГў\x80\x99m not going to lie, sometimes itГў\x80\x99s true, but really itГў\x80\x99s what you make of it. UCSD is by no means a party school, but if you make an effort to meet other people and participate in events, then youГў\x80\x99ll have fun. Otherwise, you can hang out in your room with your (possibly neglected) homework. Even the design of the 6 college system helps you meet people; you get the feeling of a small community within a much larger one. Instead of trying to meet thousands of freshmen at once, youГў\x80\x99re already grouped up with a few hundred which makes it easier to meet and remember people. And here are some things I love most about UCSD in no particular order: the awesome concerts (not only are they cheap, sometimes theyГў\x80\x99re free!), sunset or meteor shower at the Cliffs (magical), the lifelong friends IГў\x80\x99ve made (priceless), the weather (itГў\x80\x99s like summer year-round!), the burritos at GoodyГў\x80\x99s (yum!), and $3 movies.', 'Keep in mind that UCSD is a major research university and some professors are more focused on their research than in teaching. However, you will also encounter some professors who are both enthusiastic about teaching and their research. Unfortunately, many undergraduate classes are large and impersonal. Classes are divided into lecture and discussion where discussion is led by a TA (a graduate student). Personally, I am not a fan of this class structure because I just donГў\x80\x99t agree that graduate students should be teaching so much. This is not to say all TAs are bad, a few of them are even better than the professor!']]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,5,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It is an also a great school for engineering majors."", ""For the application process, be sure to research about the six colleges before ranking them. All six colleges have different things to offer. They are located in different parts of campus, all have their own dorms and dining halls (although the Muir dining hall will be closed for the entirety of the 09-10 school year). Each college also has different GE requirements including a writing course. Revelle is known for having the most GE requirements, while Muir has the least. But most UCSD students love the college they're in so don't be discourage if you do not get into your first ranked college. I got into my second ranked college and still love it."", ""The cost of going to UCSD has increased in the last few years but it is far cheaper then a private school. I have financial aid and took out some Stafford loans and that was plenty to cover the cost of tuition and housing. Financial aid does differ from person to person, but I still think the cost is still manageable and you're getting plenty for what you're paying for."", ""UCSD is known to be socially dead. If you want a party school, UCSD is not the school for you! However, we do have great student organizations you can join and plenty of intramural sports to participate in. There is always plenty to do here. I have enjoyed a fair share of great concerts at this school too. If you love music and plan to go here, be sure to check out the Loft at Price Center. Also we have a six college system. I love this system because even though UCSD is a really big university, I still have a sense of close knitted community within my particular college. I'm a Sixth College student and I love it. There GEs aren't too bad and I think the dorms are really nice."", ""UCSD is known to be a research university where the professors tend to focus on their research more then their students, but there are still some great professors at this school. I had my fair share of great professors. Just be sure to go to office hours even if you're doing well in a class. With a large class size, it's a good idea to get to know your professor. The classes can become competitive, and it is very easy to fall behind. Keep on track with readings and do all homework, even if it's not mandatory. By doing this, you can probably do well at UCSD.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,11,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It is geared mainly towards the sciences and technological majors but they also have great non science facilities. They are perfect for students interested in conducting research, mainly because they have the UCSD school of medicine across the street and the Jacob's school of Engineering, facilitating the process of attaining an internship. UCSD is perfect for any individual who has been identified as an overachiever who wants to truly make a difference in this world. College is honestly the place where you find yourself and what lights your heart and fills you with passion. It is here where you find the rest of your life!"", ""If you are interested in UCSD, there are some things you should try to acquire or be aware of before entering college. Learn time management skills! Be organized. Do not procrastinate. Find an effective way to study. Try to enhance your writing and math skills for placement exams. Study for those AP exams and try to earn as much college credit as possible. Learn how to budget your money. Lastly, make sure the universities you apply to have your major. There are also some tips for attending UCSD or any other university. Do not skip class. Do not enroll in any 8 a.m. classes unless you are truly a morning person, it is much harder getting up early! Attend your professor's office hours, you need those letters of recommendation for Grad School. Establish a close professional relationship with your TA's, they do all of the grading. Seek academic advising. Explore your major and other alternatives. Join clubs and/or sports. Network, make friends and have fun!"", 'UCSD is ranked the seventh best public university in the nation. We are taught by leading individuals who are brilliant in their field. All of the professors that I have had are amazing and have dedicated many years of their lives for the subject they are most passionate about. Because of this you can assume that each professor cares about the material being taught, making it more enjoyable for the students.', ""Being that UCSD is a highly populated university, the six colleges make it very easy to meet new people and form communities. Despite UCSD's reputation of being a socially dead university, there is actually countless events that promote socializing and having fun. There are always free activities to engage in like free zumba dancing, free yoga class, attending athletic games, free meditation, exercise classes, salsa dancing and many more. Along with those fun events there are also concerts with featured artists at a low price. The box office also sells tickets for amusement parks and the entertainment at a student discount. Also, a car is not necessary because every student gets a free bus pass. This bus pass is incredible! It takes us to all of the attractions in San Diego."", ""Transitioning from high school to college was definitely an adventure, and not a very thrilling one for that matter. I left my house feeling like an adult ready to encounter anything that stumbled my way, but it so happened that I was the one stumbling my way into the world. Classes are difficult and lecture halls are daunting. It is extremely intimidating to be sitting with 300 other people trying to grasp as much material as possible in 50 minutes. Due to the great number of people, it is a highly competitive atmosphere, but you still find many people willing to assist you. I have learned to sit in the front so I can concentrate better and fully comprehend the professor. A's are not given away like they were in high school, so one has to work extremely hard to attain their desired grade and even then disappointment lingers in.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,13,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""Academically, UCSD is great for the aforementioned bioengineer, bioinformatic, and computer-related hopefuls out there. If you don't know what you want to do, UCSD is great regardless. Unless you want to get into law--we don't offer law as a major, here (sorry?). For everything else beyond the world of academia, this place is for you, no matter who you are. UCSD can be prestigious and humbling at the same time."", ""Some of you may not choose to attend UCSD (and if it were because of my review, I apologize), so if any of you take anything from this review, let it be these tips to live by: 1. Make friends. They are an invaluable resource that can get you out of (and into) hard times. You can save hundreds by sharing textbooks with them and can save hours of studying by collaborating with them. They will fill the times that you would otherwise be alone at a bus stop, walking to class, listening to a boring teacher, or writing an essay at four in the morning. They will become your colleagues by day and the ones you'll be working together with to try to walk straight by night. They may very well become your best men and your bridesmaids. If you do anything in college, get some damn friends. 2. Learn to do the laundry. Going home on weekends and breaks with a bag full of laundry is no way to start being an adult. Most of you are already 18 by now, for goodness' sake. Learn to wake up on time on your own, wash your own dishes, and most importantly-- 3. Grow up. We all have to do it. What separates a high schooler from a respectable college student is the ability to get top marks during the day, celebrate like a maniac at night and be a sobered-up scholar by the first class the next morning, all while having no one else know about your crazy side besides your friends (which you should have [see #1]). It's like a mullet, but for *life*. Learn to balance things. Party animal doesn't go well on a resume and neither does just being noted for graduating. What it comes down to is-- 4. Effort. Like I had said before, most people are fine with just getting by. That could mean getting a 4.0 in college but not having one extracurricular on their resumes. What you need to do is find out how you can put a little extra something out there to better yourself and your future. Reluctance to prevent regret will be your biggest regret. I'm not saying be a superhero, but once you get yourself committed to a program or internship it's hard to get yourself to quit and once it's over you'll either have loved it or glad you did it. 5. Learn to speak. Learn to speak to others in a tolerating, educated manner because you will meet people different than you and you will meet people smarter than yourself. Be open-minded but learn to support your values. Also, have some values that are worth supporting. For the introverts out there, you can remain shy or indifferent but it helps to learn how to instinctively make adequate eye-contact and practice good speaking skills. All this also ties into your having to-- 6. Be confident. College will attempt to change you, but use your head and stick to the path you'll ultimately thank yourself for adhering to. Don't get eaten alive out there."", ""UCs are constantly becoming more and more costly to attend. Now you (or should I say whoever is paying for your education) has to make the choice of whether or not getting an education from an accredited four-year university such as a UC will be worth it. You can research all you want the difference between a UC and a non-UC and may be reluctant to find that there are not many differences between the two in places that you expected there to be some. From an educational standpoint you could learn just as much from a CSU and it really depends on your area of academic concentration. Speaking of area of concentration, UCSD has one of the best bioengineering, bioinformatics, and computer systems according to U.S. News and World Report, so if that's what you're into then this school is right up your alley and is worth the buck. From a non-academic standpoint, the food you'll have to at one point buy from the cafeterias on campus is nothing compared to home-cooked meals your mother would make but definitely better and more effort-efficient than anything most of us lazy (male) students could make. Even if you're a very capable cook you'll have to buy a dining plan along with your housing plan and won't have time to cook a quarter of your meals. Most importantly (and relevant to most of us): the experience. College will be nothing that a majority of us out there will have experienced. Feeling like an adult but living like a kid will be in most of our futures and we will make mistakes that will shape our future and will have spiced up our past and present. You might gain more street smarts one year than book smarts! If you approach the social scene in college right, you'll have one wild ride (for the lack of a term more concise and with equal brevity) ."", ""UCSD caters to all of your needs. Book fiend? We've got a great libraries, all interconnected within the campus and with other campuses in the nation. Body guru? Almost 200,000 square feet of gym complex. Foodie? The campus itself houses eateries for those with specific tastes and those with iron stomachs (UCSD is also located in the upper-class city of La Jolla so feel free to explore what hoighty-toighty establishments it has to offer). Hardcore partier/college sport fanatic? I heard from the grapevine that there's a school called SDSU nearby and if you're willing to supplement school pride with San Diego pride you'll fit right in. Oh, and if you're into surfing or whatever the ocean has to offer, UCSD is located right next to the beach. The San Diego area is also home to 6 of the 10 best beaches in Southern California. There's also hang gliding, hot air ballooning and whatnot for those of you with a source of income. The undergraduate housing facilities on campus vary in quality depending on which of the six colleges you choose to attend but overall they are satisfactory and should hardly affect the real source of your college enjoyment--the people. We're social beings constantly hungry for the interaction with others, and like any other college with a diverse student body, you'll be making lifelong friends and unforgettable memories. That only sounded cheesy and overused because it's true."", ""Really, learning is up to you! Depending on your goals in life, how much you're willing to achieve those goals and where you want your education at UCSD to take you your views on the concept of learning may differ from those of anyone else. Sure, the curricula at UCSD is diverse and its research opportunities ranked highest in the nation but what learning comes down to is whether or not we as students put forth the effort to retain the knowledge we receive (and have probably paid a hefty sum for). I have witnessed through experience and my colleagues a vicious cycle of academia: memorize empty facts and correlations, pass the corresponding tests then ditch the material as if it were never learned. I cannot say that this method is not effective nor viable as I have practiced it myself with satisfactory results. What I can say is that, like any university, you'll be taking classes as prerequisites to other, more advanced courses and you'll rather have had learned and familiarized yourself with the material a good amount than have had relearned the fundamentals along with the newer material. Also, if you're looking at going to med school and taking the MCAT or are some other student needing to take some standardized test later in your college career you'll wish you had stored the information from your classes in that capable, UC-worthy noggin of yours. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that you should earn good marks in college the old-fashioned way: by learning the material and not cramming it all the night before and purging it all after the test. It does yourself a favor and brings you another step closer to becoming (dare I say it?) a good student! Like an old professor of mine once told me: people are complacent with just getting by--it's those who put forth the extra bit of effort that go far. You're going to be attending college soon--it's best to remove all possibility of regret now by staying ahead of the competition, even if by an inch.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,14,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Community Service Officers (CSO) patrol the campus at night on their bicycles, watching for any suspicious activity and escorting students back to their dorms after a late-night study session at Geisel. The campus is relatively well lit at night, with emergency buttons scattered throughout.', 'Although an official Greek row does not exist, UC San Diego is home to a variety of sororities and fraternities. Their booths can be viewed often along Library Walk. There are many with differing focuses to welcome anyone - from community service based, to engineering or health career fields, to social and night life lovers.', 'Students who would love a large school with countless academic and research opportunities would find home in UC San Diego. Additionally, anyone who finds an interest in nature and preservation will be delighted with the various hikes and ten-minute walk to the beach that the school offers.', 'The Sun God statue, located in Muir College, is one of the defining characteristics of the school. Students can be seen walking backwards under it as a famed tradition that promises good grades on their finals. Well-known annual traditions include the Watermelon Drop at the top of Urey Hall, and the Sun God Festival, which showcases worldwide musical talents.', ""On-Campus students must use the Dining Dollars program, in which they must purchase their meals in dining halls with individually priced foods, rather than a buffet-style swipe system. Dining halls are found throughout campus, roughly one for each of the six colleges. They vary in the quality of food and atmosphere provided - for example, Eleanor Roosevelt's Cafe Ventanas boasts beautiful architecture and design with mediocre food, while Muir College's newly constructed Pines excels in both aesthetics and food quality / variety. Revelle College's Plaza is conveniently located near the highly used York Hall, but lacks in both eye-candy and good food. Each college also houses their own marketplace, where students can buy food ingredients, microwavable meals, and various school necessities, also with their dining dollars. These are highly convenient, and are most packed after late-night study sessions, since they close at 1 AM."", ""Each of the six colleges house their own students. The dorm quality varies according to the college and the building type. I lived in Revelle's Argo Hall, which was a towering building housing approximately fifty students each floor. Dorms are always suite style, and can house anywhere from ten to fifteen students. The bathrooms are surprisingly easy to share - despite living with so many other girls, I rarely had any shower conflicts. Dorms are often equipped with common rooms and a shared kitchen / lounge area with the floor. Resident Advisors are highly helpful, easing the transition to college by planning events throughout the year that are both social and educational. The suite-style approach that UC San Diego takes is effective by providing the privacy needed while still fostering a social environment."", ""As a competitive member of the University of California system, it is consistently ranked in the top schools of the nation. Consequently, its academic rigor is immensely high, especially for students entering into a science major program. At this school, academics are the number one focus; anyone who wants to challenge themselves in this competitive environment is welcome. Like the majority of other UC's, San Diego embraces a quarter system as opposed to a semester system. This means that the regular school year consists of three quarters - Fall, Winter, and Spring, in which students undergo only ten weeks of instruction followed by a Finals Week before receiving their grade. These ten weeks go by incredibly fast, and is unforgiving to anyone who chooses to slack off. The trick to surviving this system is to study seriously from the first week, rather than falling behind and finding yourself in Geisel cramming in ten weeks' of information during the crowded Finals Week.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,17,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

At night, there are Campus Security Officers patrolling the school and escorting students back to their residences when called. In addition, there are Residential Security Officers patrolling the residential facilities throughout the school to ensure the students' safety throughout the night. The RSO staff is extremely friendly and they give the students a feeling of security in their homes at night.

On this day, the campus comes alive as students unite for a music festival with the top artists and performers of the year.', ""Settled in the astoundingly beautiful beaches and natural reserves of La Jolla, students at UCSD are extremely lucky to have access to endless amounts of outdoor activities. From surfing lessons, hikes along preserved trails, hang gliding on the outskirts of campus, and so much more. Not an outdoorsy person? That's not a problem, there is plenty to do around the San Diego area. Hit the clubs in San Diego's Gaslamp District. Visit the world-famous San Diego Zoo and Safari Park. Go shopping in the large variety of stores provided by the Westfield UTC or Fashion Valley Center. See if your favorite artist is performing at Porter's Pub or RIMAC. Catch a baseball game at the grand Petco Park stadium. There's a never-ending list of things to do on and off campus, it's up to you to find them!"", ""The dining halls and markets around UCSD do not disappoint. Sure it's no five-star restaurant with a million reviews, but it's as good as it's going to get when it comes to dorm food. There are many options in the six UCSD dining facilities, satisfying your vegetarian needs, meat cravings, and sweet tooth. If you grow tired of the dining halls, UCSD also has a sit-in restaurant called The Bistro, where you can order gourmet dishes such as a sauteed salmon, glazed chicken, bbq pork loins, and more. UCSD was also recently voted the #1 vegan-friendly college campus in the United States."", 'The dorm life at UCSD is extraordinary in that it creates an environment for the students to interact, grow stronger together, and develop long lasting relationships. Living on campus gives the students a sense of community, as we interact with each other on a day to day basis. The residential advisors are excellent in helping new students adjust to their new environment, and the suite format of the dorms really allows students to connect in a deeper bond. Resources are magnificent, the housing facilities are commendable, and the staff is nothing but welcoming and helpful. I could not have asked for a better dorm experience than my first year at UCSD.', 'Every student is unique, and each and every person works in different ways. As for me, I believe the academic rigor at UCSD is challenging. Coming from the top of my high school, I found myself as well as other students struggling to keep up in classes and working extra hard to understand certain material. The professors and their courses challenge the students so that they can reach their full potential, and because UCSD is composed of academically excellent students, this intensifies the academic rigor and makes the environment even more competitive.', ""When entering UCSD, it is important to keep a positive outlook and to stay true to who you are. To become successful in not just UCSD, but anywhere, it is crucial to know who you are and what kind of person you want to be. Do not conform to fit any type of social standard or to develop any relationships, because ultimately you will not succeed and end up unhappy with who you've become. The key to success is good old-fashioned honest hard work and determination. Go to your lectures, don't oversleep, keep up with your courses, ask questions in class, stay healthy, give yourself time to socialize and relax, but most importantly, know the balance between work and play. These are the steps to success."", ""Upon attending the University of California-San Diego, it has become more than an academic institute for me, it is a new home, a place of self-discovery, as well as a foundation to a strong and bright future. UCSD provides a welcoming environment for its students, returning and new, and it pushes you to reach your potential with its inspirational messages and morals around spread throughout the campus amongst its six colleges. The campus's endless resources and eager professors and counselors are a relief to have with me every step of the way, and I am grateful to be part of the UC San Diego experience.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,18,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!!

Take a tour! Preferably during the week; there is no better way to get a feel for the campus than to be led around by a current student and have them dish on everything you need to know. It's also very helpful in understanding the six college system. Don't forget to check out the beach after the tour. 2. Go online! Look into all of the different colleges online to get a better feel for the system, and how you might want to rank them when you apply. Remember: your college has nothing to do with your major! 3. Go to office hours! When you get to university, whether or not you attend UCSD, go to your professor's office hours! I promise they aren't scary old men that will eat you if you dare venture into their cave of an office. There are actually cool people (men and women), and they are there to help you succeed, if you have a question, go to them, they will help you--if they don't, then that was a fluke, and don't let it discourage you. They are also great when it comes time to get a rec letter, which you will need at some point in your life! 4. Eat the food. Check out the dining hall food while you are on campus--you can get food court food anywhere. I am partial to Oceanview Terrace's breakfast burritos, but if it's a Friday, definitely check out the international lunches at the International Center. 5. Ask questions! If you're confused about something, call the campus and ask somebody! You don't want to just assume things about UCSD, only to find out it isn't what you expected. Ask students, faculty, staff; email people, and they will likely reply honestly. People are a great resource that are seldom used."", ""Being an out-of-state student, my tuition costs are a lot higher than those students that are from California. It's the one downside of attending UCSD, but it's totally worth the extra cost, at least for me, because UCSD has become my home. I recommend applying for as many scholarships as you can if you are an out-of-state student."", ""I love, love, love UCSD! I don't want to come off as someone who is just writing this to make the school look good, I honestly have enjoyed every second of my time here. This is a school that doesn't pressure you to be anything, and without that weight on your shoulders, you have the opportunity to open yourself up and try new things. If you want to go out and party all the time, go for it; if you want to stay in your room and study all the time, go for it; if you want to join the zombie club, or a sports team, go for it! There is no judgement here, and that is something that is truly hard to find. UCSD is a great place to find yourself, and discover what you enjoy, without any outside pressures."", ""All of the professors at UC San Diego have a terminal degree in their field, meaning they have a PhD or have gone as far as they possible can go. This means that the professors really are the best in their fields. I love my major, and I love where my education is taking me, so naturally, I love my classes and learn a lot from my professors. We do have large class sizes, which can be a little daunting at first, but it's good because it really forces you to take control of your education. You have to actively decide that you are going to pay attention in lecture, do the work, and get the grade. It's kind of exciting having that kind of independence, even in just getting to choose your classes. There are so many opportunities to expand your knowledge base; I took a philosophy course, which is way outside of my major, but it was one of the best classes I've ever taken.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,19,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The school will really prepare you for graduate studies. This school really motivates you to focus on the academic side of college!', 'First and foremost, tour the campus. Its really worthwhile to listen to the tour guides tell you about all of the amazing features of this campus. Second, look into the general requirements for each college. Ranking is important especially if you want to get out in four years. Try and find the college that matches up with your major the best. Once your here: Go to class, but also re-listen to the podcasts. I was amazed at how much it helped me to go back and be able to listen to the lecture at my own pace (especially great for professors who talk quickly). I really recommend getting involved. It is rumored that UCSD is the University for the Socially Dead, but that is definitely just a rumor. There are so many great opportunities on campus from concerts to clubs to Greek life. There is something out there for everyone, I urge everyone to get involved.', ""Tuition increases are daunting but there are so many scholarships out there. I highly recommend going straight to a four year university. The cost may seem overwhelming but the life experience you gain from going away to college is invaluable. The classes are much more interactive and informative than community college classes. The atmosphere of this campus really motivates you. The science program isn't cut throat which is really refreshing."", 'What could be better than looking at the ocean every day? UCSD really has it all: a great academic reputation, great location, and tons of fun activities around campus. Oh and who could forget to mention the amazing weather. There are always events going on and there is an organization out there for everyone.', 'The professors are truly amazing. Every professor must be actively involved in research in there field and have a PhD in there area of focus. Professors really know the material and hearing personal stories of how they have applied the material that you are currently learning in the real world really brings the course alive. Classes are large but professors really want to get to know the students. There is also a free tutoring program on campus, Oasis, that is extremely helpful for those tougher classes. Some of the general education requirements may seem abstract on first glance but every class I have taken has paid off and taught me something valuable.']]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,20,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College.

We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging.

This is a very competitive university, so one must know that it is not easy. However, when put in prospective, it does not feel like you are doing that much work. It becomes habit, and eventually will seem normal. Although it may not have the name like UCLA, if one does their research, it is constantly ranked above UCLA and even is #1 in the nation in some fields of study. You must have determination, but also be will to relax and go with the flow. The university knows what it is doing, and with the counselors help, you will be pushed in any direction you want. Some classes can be difficult, but that is the same with all top-rated schools. So I would recommend students that are willing to work hard for their goals. It will pay off in the end.', ""A great tip I couldn't stress more is, relax. Many people freak out over their first year (as I did), and do poorly. It is okay to get C's now, especially since this university houses some of the top minds in the country. Also, I can not stress the importance of going to discussions. If you miss a lecture or don't understand what is going on, the TA's in discussion always cover what was discussed, and will take personal questions. So if your not someone who likes going to lecture all the time, make sure to attend discussion!"", ""This College is a top-rated research university, and it definitely offers a top-level education. On top of the professors is discussions with TA's, or teacher assistants. These are graduate students, usually from other top rated universities such as Stanford, CIT, and even some Harvard and Yale. The university gives you many opportunities for outside work and internships (I often find myself deleting them out of habit I get so many), so this is a great place to meet big people in high places. UC San Diego is extremely competitive is the science field, especially in Biology as it is impacted (only a certain number of kids can get in). However, they are very skilled in the arts as well as social sciences as many law students and actors come from this university. Although it may seem the professors have other business to attend, compared to other universities they are much easier to reach and will even do privates if asked."", 'The 6 College system was extremely confusing for me at first. When i applied I had no idea which college to go for based on my major. However, talking to past students they definitely assured me not to worry. The 6 college system has no affect on your major or ranking in the system. It is only based on location, so most people chose the college based on where most their classes are. For example, Political Science majors or any English/Humanities majors go to Elenore College, while many math or science majors attend Revelle or Marshall. Many engineers may also attend these, but also may look into Warren as the structural engineering building is located there. 6th college is mainly for the arts. I like the University because it is very low-key. There is no crime, it is beautiful all the time, and the beach is only a ten minute walk and can be seen from classrooms. Many people might say it is a no-party school. They are wrong. There are plenty of student activities and parties to go to, in the Greek housing and on campus. Once you go things will just spill out for you.', 'The rate at which you learn material here is much faster than any other place I have been, including Community College and The Ohio State University. Not all the professors are extremely helpful, or easy to understand at times, but the Teacher Assistants will clarify any questions you might have on a more personal level. Therefore, you can get a closer connection to the material while going to a top-rated research university.']]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,21,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""If you want a well-rounded education with just the right balance of studying and having fun, UCSD is perfect. Overall, UCSD is a beautiful campus located right next to the beach and in a quiet town. But those looking for a social scene don't have to look very far either."", ""If you want to party: rush a fraternity or sorority. This is the prime way to meet other students with the same interest as you. Even if you do not pledge, you'll make friends who want to party as well. If you want to be a Muir student, you MUST place Muir as your number one choice."", ""With the rise of tuition, it is getting more and more difficult to get a bang for the buck. Although the education itself may not be the best bang for the buck, UCSD has taught me critical values that I am utilizing at my internships and workplace. But yes, the price of education is rising rapidly, but it is still cheaper than a private education. Also, rent can be pretty steep at some off-campus properties, but if you're not too picky, you can find a good price."", ""While the social scene is NOT the most active here, students can choose how involved they become. The Greek system (sororities and fraternities) is not the best, but enough for anyone looking to party. There are also numerous professional and multicultural sororities and fraternities that also have many parties. Don't forget the Sun God Festival, held annually in the Spring quarter. Every year, famous musicians are brought to campus, and UCSD students break the socially dead stereotype for a weekend of debauchery. It is consistently regarded as one of the top college festivals around the nation, and I can testify that I've had fun every single year. UCSD provides a rigorous academic schedule while still leaving room for just the perfect amount of fun. I enjoy being surrounded by students who are focused, smart, and fun. San Diego is a decent college town. Most things (restaurants, grocery stores, malls, etc) are a short drive or bus trip away, but the beach is right across the street from campus. Pacific Beach (10 minute drive away), a popular area full of bars, or Gaslamp in downtown are both places that the 21+ crowd can enjoy."", ""Like many other schools, the quality of your education will depend on your major. I am currently a senior Economics student. Here's a clear warning: an Economics major is not the same as a Business major. I've learned mostly mathematical work that is not entirely useful in a business environment. However, those who want a business education can take classes at the Rady School of Management. However, those interested in science, especially bioengineering, will be very pleased here as there are countless labs to gain experience in. Theater and dance are also ranked well here. As in other research-based schools, many professors are much more interested in completing their research projects than they are in teaching a class of hundreds of students. However, every once in awhile you will come across a professor who is amiable and truly interested in your learning.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,23,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt.

Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging.

Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!!

Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""UCSD is great for students who are able to manage their time wisely or for students who want to learn how and experience a more independent lifestyle. Academically UCSD is known as a science school and so people interested in science will definitely enjoy coming here and even more so if they are interested cutting edge research (that stuff happens all day every day here). Being such a big school in every way ultimately makes UCSD a school where pretty much anyone can come and find their own personal piece of UCSD where they will be happy. The only thing I have to emphasize is that UCSD is not your stereotypical college so if that's what you want you don't want UCSD"", ""Just like everyone else has probably been telling you, the most important thing to keep in mind when choosing a college is to make sure to choose one that suits you. Ask yourself in all seriousness what it is exactly you want out of college and don't say what your parents want or what you think you should want but instead what you really truly want in the immediate future as well as way down the road."", ""Here UCSD falls a bit short. The dining dollar system is quite simply a rip off if you ask me. The food at the dining halls can range from pretty bad to amazing yet the price is always the same. So one day you'll get a great meal and be served a decent portion and be completely happy paying about 12 bucks (this is for a very full meal by the way) and other days you'll feel like starving yourself. HOWEVER there are some private restaurants in the Price Center (Panda express and stuff) that may seem expensive but actually turn out to be cheaper when you consider quantity and quality. That said, tuition, room and board, and books are relatively inexpensive (Still expensive but on the more affordable side when you look at other schools). The quality of on campus housing varies from college to college within UCSD but for the most part it is very comfortable. Public transportation is free for undergrads so getting around is not bad at all except of course that you actually have to take a bus to go pretty much anywhere off campus. Groceries and stuff are cheap if you go off campus and expensive on campus. All in all if you are smart about where you spend your money you can guarantee a more than decent bang for your buck."", ""Some people say that UCSD stands for the UC of the Socially Dead and I gotta admit to some degree it is. There is basically no school spirit which many would say results from the lack of a foot ball team so many of the related social events like pep rallies and what not don't happen. Also the shear size of the school can make it hard to meet people unless of course you are looking to join clubs or get involved with the greek system. But enough negativity I gave UCSD 4 stars for a reason. The school itself puts on various social events that are actually pretty fun. Dances and concerts as well as fairs and student art performances happen all the time and are almost always free. The surrounding area and the campus itself are beautiful facilitating chill hang outs sessions out doors in the California sun as well as pick up games of various sports. There is also blacks beach not too far that you can go to to enjoy the nice weather. But perhaps the greatest thing about UCSD is the freedom you are given when scheduling classes since it allows you to optimize your college experience to suit your lifestyle. Oh and being a pretty huge campus means nearly endless exploration if you are into walking ALOT."", ""UCSD can seriously show off when it comes to the quality of its professors as well as the material taught in class. Being one of the lead research universities in the country you can rest assured that everything you learn, especially in the sciences is on the absolute cutting edge. Since UCSD operates on the quarter system as opposed to the semester system, classes are much more specific. What I mean to say by this is that since there are three quarters in the year (yea its weird that they are called quarters) as opposed to two semesters, the material you would learn in a year long class is divided into three chunks which forces you to really focus and learn the heck out of the material since you'll ultimately have three finals and a score of tests in between to be ready for. So yea you have to put in a good amount of work but in the end you'll find that you know a very great deal of accurate information.""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,30,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Meet some students that are from San Diego so they can show you outside of La Jolla and really see what San Diego is about! The beach and the cliffs are only 10 minute walking distance, so take advantage of the beautiful scenery!"", ""There are many different dining options for students. The best ones that students like to go to are Ocean View Terrance and Pines. The Bistro has sushi you can swipe with dining dollars too! Food is expensive but you'll be using your dining dollars. I highly recommend budgeting, because it's really sad when it's only Winter quarter and people are out of dining dollars. If that does happen, local grocery markets are only a few bus stops away and public transportation is free for students!"", ""Every college within UCSD has its own feel and aura. You will meet all kinds of people from those who are really strange, those who have completely different financial, social status to people that you will get along with really well. It's super convenient to get from dorm room to classroom. Some colleges provide a kitchen so you can even cook your own meals if you miss home cooked food. You have lots of freedom, but make responsible decisions!"", ""If you're an social sciences major like I am ( and do not have an interest/ struggle in math or science fields) you'll have an easier time than Engineer majors. Math and science is no joke, but there is always academic support around! Classes are challenging, but meeting up with your TA/professor/mentor can always help your understanding on different subjects."", ""1) Avoid eye contact on library walk. Everyday, students will be advertising for their fraternities, clubs and events. If you're not interested and are rushing to class, just walk with a purpose to avoid unwanted fliers or politely say no thank you, because no one likes to be disrespected either! 2) Meet other students and create study groups! They are extremely helpful and much easier to study for exam materials rather than cramming by yourself. No one likes a study buddy who does not contribute- do your share of the work too! 3) If you're worried about having friends at a new school, get out there and meet new people from different organizations you're interested in. You'll begin to meet people from different circles and also do productive things. Not everyone has the money, time or patience to join social fraternities or sororities. Campus clubs offer the same if not better social experience! You can also make new connections that could help you in a class you're taking or with a new job/internship."", ""UCSD is in La Jolla, not San Diego- there's a big difference in the two environments where La Jolla has more wealthy, affluent people living nearby and San Diego has a more diverse population. People say UCSD stands for UC Socially Dead, but it's honestly what someone makes of their time here!""]]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,34,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging.

Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy. There are plenty of dances strategically planned around midterms and what not to provide a little extra entertainment.

Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt.

There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for.

Small joke at UCSD that rather than gaining Freshmen 15 you get Freshmen-15.. DO NOT WORRY THOUGH. While the plan is designated so you dont really have 3 meals a day the whole year, they take into account that people will most likely not eat all 3 meals every day and that you might go home some times or eat out (plus students for the most part have snacks in their dorms).

Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress.

This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College. Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress.

This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Academic Rigor'], ['Comments', ""If you're studious, but also very social, this could be the school for you. Sure, there are a ton of people who lean more to one end of the spectrum than the other, but most people fall somewhere in the middle. The University of California, Socially Dead thing isn't all that true. I'll admit, the place to be for parties is still San Diego State University, if you're in the area, or UC Santa Barbara, if you can manage to drive up there for a weekend, but there are many parties here at UCSD. The best ones are usually off campus, though. That being said, if you are more of an independent spirit, into the whole co-op side of things, this place will be pretty dandy for you. It's not Berkeley, it's not Santa Cruz, but it's alright. There are tons of opportunities for you to be involved with other people who are more into your interests than the rest of your fellow UC San Diegans. And if you're more of the academic, studious type, Geisel Library is pretty awesome. That place has more study space than the university knows what to do with."", ""Learning all depends on you - I assume everybody knows that. Congratulations if you have been accepted to this university, not everybody gets in, but your acceptance doesn't mean you've got little to no work to do. If you don't go to class (and you depend on the podcasts) you most likely will not do too well. And going to class, for most people, will not suffice. You must do your homework, you must put in extra time studying, and you must leave time for sleep! Now, the nagging aside, I've had a nice time here. I took a diverse course load my first quarter. In my opinion, doing this keeps you sane. As an incoming freshman, you donГў\x80\x99t want to bite off more than you can chew. Seriously, take twelve units, give yourself the space to settle in, and donГў\x80\x99t worry about getting straight AГў\x80\x99s. That can be hard to do in college, especially during your first quarter with 5 courses and a seminar. If you're a musician, but not a music major, ensembles are something to take advantage of. There are also tons of clubs, tons of sports, tons of so many opportunities to socialize and express yourself. This place is nice for the artsy-fartsy type. And take advantage of the crafts center, especially if you're not too artsy but want to give it all a shot. Take advantage of your classes' discussion times, if you have one, and take advantage of office hours. DonГў\x80\x99t be so hung up on the college you have been enrolled in. I have it easy, IГў\x80\x99ll admit, IГў\x80\x99m in Muir College Гў\x80\x93 this college is great for everybody because the GEГў\x80\x99s are so, well, lax. But being in Muir doesnГў\x80\x99t mean youГў\x80\x99re going to actually have an easy time here. Warren has one of the hardest writing courses, from what I hear, and Revelle has the most science and mathematics requirements of the six colleges, but there certainly are perks to every community. The GEГў\x80\x99s should be the least of your worries. Anyway, once you start to meet people and make friends, youГў\x80\x99ll forget about being a miserable Sixth College student light years away from The Bistro. Be open to new experiences. If you're uptight, loosen up! Take every opportunity you can to experience as much as you can, but keep your limits in mind - don't take anything too far. And, keep in mind: success is all at your disposal (this goes for both social and academic)."", ""The UC system always finds a way to add more to your tab. Here at UCSD, you'll be paying for so many things you probably won't even care to have. But UCSD is much less expensive than private universities, and you get healthcare, a gym, food, etc. Anywho, at $30,000 a year, if you don't have the money AND don't even know what you're going to do with your life (in other words, you're only here to socialize at the expense of your parents' hard-earned cash), attend a CSU or community college instead. You can always transfer, and you'll learn just the same at any institution."", ""I understand the beach is one of UCSD's biggest selling points. That being said, the beach is right in your backyard - so take advantage of it! I'm a student in Muir College, so I think I can only speak for my fellow Muirons, but this place can be pretty gnarly if you're a surfer. Surfing before class is something to definitely be excited about, and if you live in Tioga or Tenaya, all you have to do is jaywalk across 4-lane traffic, walk through a neighborhood, down a hill, and you're at the beach. If you're not a surfer, the beach is still nice, too. Go for a run or a walk, or even take your homework with you and sit at the beach to work on it - it's really relaxing, very worth it. The art pieces on campus give a certain feel to your experience here. I personally like them, not necessarily for their art value, but because a scavenger hunt is always fun. And the numerous activities on campus are definitely something else to (also) take advantage of. Look around, you'll find plenty of opportunities to make your time here enjoyable."", ""Some teachers can be great, and some TAs are better than the teachers themselves, but learning still depends on you. If you're in a language course, you'll enjoy the small class feel, sort of like being back in high school. It's a great opportunity to get to know other people, as opposed to being in a lecture hall. Discussions are very helpful, too. Now, if you're in a mathematics or science course, you will be in a lecture hall, with over 100 other students. It can be hard to focus, especially if you're taking these courses for GE credit, but many of them are podcasted so you can always go back to the podcast when you're studying or reviewing material. Also, most teachers and TAs are very readily available - taking advantage of this is a smart idea. I know it's a bit intimidating at first, but most teachers I have met are very nice, and they don't want to fail you! There are many intellectually stimulating courses you can take, and you will also come across both incredibly challenging courses and unbelievably easy courses. The learning environment here can be of both the traditional and unconventional type, it just depends on the teacher or the course itself.

Nothing comes easy, but if you work hard enough, this university can definitely help you out! Tips for prospective students Definitely tour the campus, and if you have an interest APPLY!!!! Utilize the resources this school has to offer. There are plenty of tools and opportunities, no excuses to not be having the time of your life in all respects! Bang for the buck With all I've said so far, I would hope that you would feel like you get your bang for the buck. Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for.

Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well.

What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy.

I have met such diverse groups of students, and honestly underestimated some of their intelligence.

Many students complain about this aspect of UCSD and I felt it too at first. However, I visited Berkeley and the same is true there as well. Besides their frat row, there is not much to do but to enjoy your time with some friends and eat some good food. San Diego beaches are also amazing so it is always fun to do that. Once every few years you can go to the beach at night to view the blue bioluminescence, an amazing phenomenon. Onbroadway club in downtown holds many events for students. In addition, UCSD has many on-campus dances and concerts which host many cool new indie bands. The Sungod festival is the annual favorite of all students and has in the past featured headliners like Wiz Khalifa, Drake, T.I. and many more, all artists who went on to be best selling artists after performing at our school.

Overall food is fine, but will get repetitive as at most universities."", 'I was in Sixth and this left me at a great disadvantage since the dorms are spread away from the other colleges, the 1st year res halls are 2 story buildings and it the smallest college. All these traits, I felt translated into me not fitting into my college too well and I do not believe the arrangement really fostered as much interaction. Students who like the house-like setting and 2 story arrangement (1 floor is girls, other is boys) will enjoy this very much. I prefer suite style living also but in actual buildings with co-ed floors and this was present in other colleges. Also, I have many friends in other colleges meaning it is not impossible to do so but the colleges are very spread apart so one really must make an effort.', 'I cannot speak for all majors since I have only taken lower-division classes in those fields to complete general education requirements. For biology and chemistry majors, the academic rigor is quite challenging for the upper-division classes.

The six colleges will not greatly affect your major or your future career path but generally it is better to pick the colleges based on the vibe and personalities they are known for, since it is thus easier to meet more people like you.

So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!!

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

If you are over 21 and want to drink, you would have to jump on the 5 freeway and go to Pacific Beach to go to a decent bar.

Any activity related to the water and the beach is easily doable.', 'The Food and Dining program at UCSD is rather expensive, but you do get what you pay for. In my opinion, the food and dining program at UCSD are always constantly looking for ways to continually improve the food and dining experience. It can get confusing ordering from the grill, especially at Cafe Ventanas for breakfast but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. I would say the cleanliness factor and the employees who work at the dining halls are excellent as well.', 'I was a transfer student from a community college who chose to dorm at the Villages of Torrey Pines in my first year. It is, however, incredibly expensive. One of the great benefits was that it specifically catered to transfer students and my experiences there were mostly positive. I thought that being a transfer student would make it difficult to meet people but because of the excellent dorm life, I was able to meet a diverse variety of people. Parking, however can be problematic.', 'I was a Literature in English major at UCSD and I would have to say that the academic rigor at UCSD was adequate. UCSD is a school that is designed for students pursuing a degree in the hard sciences and I would assume that students who are within those majors have a different view on the academic rigor at UCSD. Overall, it was a smooth transition from community college life to a university life. Academic rigor is also dependent on the college that one is in at UCSD. I was in Sixth College and as a transfer had most of my general education requirements complete by the time I entered UCSD.', 'UCSD is a great school for the kinds of people who are independent. It does not have, in my opinion as well as many others a good sports program, therefore there is not much school spirit at all. I would also say that the Greek Life at UCSD has a bad reputation', 'UCSD is an ideal school for the academically ambitious student whose main priority is their studies. Situated in picturesque La Jolla, San Diego, UCSD has a great support system that allows accessibility to counselors and professors making UCSD an environment that promotes academia over anything else.

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem.

Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt.

On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here!

Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!!

Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!! Where else can you get such hands-on experience. San Diego is such a diverse city, culturally and scientifically, it is rich with job opportunities, so what better way to get a head start than in La Jolla! Port Triton (our",True,0,0,"{250492=Revelle college has a tradition called the Watermelon Drop every year in June. They crown a Watermelon Queen (either gender), and they get to drop a watermelon off the roof of a building, aiming at a target on the ground. There is a small concert venue called the Che Cafe.

It looks like a run-down shack, but the ambiance is comfortable and fun., 1048930=La Jolla Beach UTC Gas Lamp District Seaworld Mission Bay Old Town San Diego Balboa Park Del Mar Coronado Island, 880118=On campus, there are the gym facilities. Again like the food I would get off campus for the really world class recreation. If you are into martial arts, San Diego has a really famous fight community. Black House gym is right up Miramar Road and ATOS jiu jitsu is on Convoy. If you are more of a water sports type, the beach is a 5 minute walk away from the campus, 1126001=Great on Academics, mediocre on campus life, and truly terrible for students with disabilities. Parking for the handicapped is sparse, the transportation programs often make you late to class, and the Office for Students with Disabilities, while mainly staffed with great people, has a lady by the name of April Garrison who is evidently fond of making students obtain thousands of out of pocket dollars of extra testing despite the fact that they have doctors who state that they are in need of assistance. When I told her I did not have that kind of money, she callously suggested that I add to my already crippling student debt and borrow it. Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre. You get the eventual hair in your food or find something that doesnt look appetizing, but hey, its a cafeteria. Just t mention, Revelle will be going through cafeteria renovation, so for the 2013-2014 school year, we will not have a cafeteria., 853203=There are plenty of interesting locations around campus. There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College.

There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform!

We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here!

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Although 2,900 may not seem like much. It is real money and most of the markets and dining halls accept dining dollars. Only the chain restaurants like panda don't take it, but that's understandable. By the end of the quarter, you will be looking for ways to get rid of dining dollars since they don't transfer over to the next quarter (excuse to stock up in your dorm)!"", ""The gym is my favorite place. The rimac arena is new and really neat. I would say it's better than L.A fitness. Also you can go explore campus. it's really big. There are things like the graffiti room that allows students to express freely without worrying if it's vandalism (allowed by the school), a giant chair near the art building, the garden of eve, the many dining halls and restaurants (since there are six colleges spread out), and going to the new Westfield mall which barely opened this year. Going downtown to San Diego is also really fun. As UCSD students, we can use the bus for free as indicated on our i.d. cards. There is also really great events on campus such as concerts and movie showings. Honestly, you just find things to do despite the reputation for it being socially dead. So we don't party hard, but we'll find a way."", ""Not the best dining hall food like UCLA, but it's doable. Also, It's a lot better than high school and elementary cafeteria food. It's ridiculously overpriced, but it's college. You can still get a taste of home because they try to offer fusion cuisines on some nights. There are lots of dining options, and the college is getting better at catering to vegans and vegetarians. I am very fond of vegetarian tofurky and I am a meat lover! Also with the great amount of dining halls and no meal plan option, you have the freedom to choose how many meals to eat or just use dining dollars to buy a snack if you preferred. It's great not to be restricted to buffet style eating and swipes because it causes great distress to those who eat less but often like I do."", ""Dorm life is chill here, although it can get cliquey. The dorms are generally alright. However I can't speak for everyone because I have the best residential halls for my college. I share a suite with only 13 other girls. We have a huge common room and a really nice restroom with towel warmers."", ""Although UCSD is not as well-known as the other top-tier schools, it is slowly rising in ranks and may surpass UCLA soon. The variety or majors and it's many programs here cater to everyone, despite the primary focus on science. The classes are tough, but the professors are not out to get you. I'm not saying the classes are easy, but it's what you make of it."", 'Find you own niche and pick a college that is most appropriate for you. University of California, San Diego is unique in that it has six colleges and it has a huge campus, but this difference allows you to grow and meet other types of people. Overall, going to this school will force you to become more independent. There is so much free time and places to explore since the campus is huge, so you have to manage your time well.', ""This university is amazing and filled with numerous opportunities. You don't feel the pressure that everyone is out to get you and allows you to explore your interests.

Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College.

There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Each dinning hall has their own different style o it depends on what you like.', ""Dorming here at UCSD is one of the best experiences in my life so far!

The perks about dorming is that you won't ever feel alone because you'll always have someone there and it's like having a sleep over every night!"", ""The classes here are difficult because most of the material you need to learn on your own.

Bang for the buck With all I've said so far, I would hope that you would feel like you get your bang for the buck. Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

You will meet a ton of diverse people from different backgrounds, and there is always something fun to do as long as you keep your mind open and actually attend events. Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.

Officers are around the campus especially at night. Students also have the option of calling campus escorts when they are walking home late at night.The city which UCSD is located in, La Jolla, is pretty safe overall.', ""UCSD has a variety of clubs to choose from and it's not particularly hard to start a new club if you feel that there is a need for one. Many clubs focus on professional development. There are lots of pre-med, pre-dental and pre-health clubs in general! Still there are clubs the celebrate culture like the Hawaii club. Our A Capella groups are amazing and always looking for new members!!. UCSD has so many clubs that it may seem daunting to choose one. They can also be hard to find and/or contact throughout the year so try to get as much info as you can during welcome week and as always regularly check out Library Walk!"", 'UCSD is great for students interested in doing research.There are lots of opportunities for those in the biological and physical sciences. UCSD also has a large group of students interested in health-care professions and it is definitely a school that can help pre-health individuals achieve their goals.It is also a great school for those that want to be engineers! Our engineering program is highly ranked and there are tremendous resources in and outside of UCSD.', ""UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks.

Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!"", 'UCSD provides its students with a tremendous amount of opportunities for success. It can be intimidating, because there are so many smart people there, but if you make the most of opportunities that come your way UCSD can provide you with the tools for success. You could have a great paying job by graduation or be going to a great medical school. UCSD challenges students but it forces you to grow up a bit and work really hard, which I think is a pretty good thing!', ""1) Go to the beach! The beach is only a short walk or bus ride away depending on where you live on campus or off. 2) Go to dances and events on campus especially the free events. Student pricing is usually provided for events that are not free. Participate in events especially during welcome week. There are no classes and tons of free food and events that are usually free. 3) Play sports like basketball, tennis, and soccer with your friends. There are plenty of basket-ball courts and tennis courts available. 4) Explore La Jolla and San Diego via the bus. This is only really fun if you don't get lost. 5) Go ice skating at the ice skating rink at the mall. 6) If you're over 21 explore the clubs of San Diego in Downtown, North Park, and Pacific Beach!!"", 'The food options tend to vary depending on which college you live in and the dining hall closest to it. In general, it takes a while to get used to. Some dining halls are better than others, because of the variety of options they provide. I suggest trying multiple dining halls and not just eating at the local dining hall. And of course there is our Price Center which provides good food from a number of recognizable fast food chains.There are also restaurants on campus that provide pretty good food as well.', ""Depending on the college that you go to, the dorms will vary in age and modernity. On average the dorm experience is pretty good. You have free wifi, which works well most of the time. Resident Assistants try to put on fun events and interact with their residents, even though students don't usually go. But free food is often available at events and these of course are the most popular! Still, dorm life is really determined by the people in your actual dorm.I know quite a few people that have no problem living in their dorm, but have problems with their roommate. Dorm life truly tests your ability to get along with different people"", 'UCSD is a really academically challenging school. The Biological Sciences and Engineering Department are are extremely competitive and demand a lot from the students.It is easy to be discouraged in these majors. But each department tries to be fair and while their may be some disparities that is to be expected. There a numerous tutoring services on campus that can help. Professors and TAs also hold office hours which can be really helpful!UCSD is also a campus dedicated to research and it is wise for research of some kind to be involved in a students academic career. UCSD is a studious campus, so studying on weekends is a regularity. The libraries and study rooms are always full around finals time so be sure to reserve your spot or get there really early!', ""I suggest that students research the different colleges within UCSD and each of their requirements. Many students pick colleges without having any knowledge of the differences between them. Even though you may not get into the given college you want, it is good to be aware of the options anyway. Secondly, I suggest that students find programs or activities to join in their first year. This just gives you the opportunity to meet people outside of your dorm and to meet people with similar interests. Thirdly, live on campus your first year if you can. Many students who commute in their first year feel that they are missing out on the college experience, UCSD has commuter lounges, of course, but students often feel at a loss when they have breaks between classes or there is an event on campus that is late at night. Lastly, DONT BE AFRAID to change your mind!Many students come in thinking that they must be a doctor or an engineer. People often get talked down to about being things like an elementary school teacher and so they are afraid to pursue their dreams. Chang is a part of the maturing process and deciding that you want to be something else is okay despite the ridicule and criticism you may face. This experience goes by so fast and you don't want to spend it regretting your decisions"", 'UCSD is an intense experience that definitely tests your abilities as an adult. The atmosphere is welcoming and finding people you share interest with is relatively easy. Ultimately, UCSD is a great place to advance your knowledge of the world around you and to cultivate lifelong friendships.']]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,149,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is.

There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community.

It makes it difficult to meet up as often as I'd like, but I manage. You will meet a ton of diverse people from different backgrounds, and there is always something fun to do as long as you keep your mind open and actually attend events. Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.

Overall, it's decent but very expensive. There are so many different dining halls on campus and each of them have their own specialty foods.

Dorm life isn't all that great at UCSD, but the good thing is that you're probably living with people who are studying to same classes and major as you are. The best thing about living in the dorms is being able to socialize with all the other freshmen. I've had many friends who transferred their third year but didn't want to do the dorm life because it was very expensive. The transfer students usually only had a handful of friends they met from classes. It's important to experience the dorm life at least a year of college. It's how I met my best friend now!"", ""Everyone at this school is brilliant, and the reason why it's considered one of the top schools in the nation. When you're surrounded by intelligent students and classes are graded based on a curve, getting an A in your classes is quite difficult. Moreover, grading on a curve promotes independent learning, only leading to academic competition and no help from your peers."", ""Make sure to take advantage of the libraries on campus, even better when they're open 24/7.

Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College.

There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event.

There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Utilize the resources this school has to offer. There are plenty of tools and opportunities, no excuses to not be having the time of your life in all respects! Bang for the buck With all I've said so far, I would hope that you would feel like you get your bang for the buck. Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well.

What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy.

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team.

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them!

In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy.

Classes aren't everyday, so there is no one to remind you to do your homework. Make sure to study everything the professor presents in each lecture because, chances are, that material is on the test. Take advantage of office hours for clarification and study in groups because you don't want to ignore anything you don't understand."", ""Make sure to do well on your Advance Placement or IB tests.

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

However, this does not mean the safety of the students is 100% guaranteed. Throughout my stay here of two quarters, there has been one stabbing, of who the culprit was never caught, several molestations, and a girl found within a ditch who later died in the hospital she was brought to. By no means is the security lacking, but UCSD can't keep tabs on every student within it's walls."", 'UCSD is perfect for those who want a balance of social activity and a rigorous education that will fully prepare them to enter adulthood. UCSD is filled with ambitious students, who are as friendly as they are intelligent. If you want to live in the best of both worlds, UCSD is the place for you.', ""As much as UCSD provides to it's student community, $30,000 is a high price for anyone. With a declining economy and student loans rising to unbelievable heights, this pricy tuition would discourage many from considering UCSD for their university. With this, I would have to advise those without the funds or scholarships to be able to afford the tuition stably consider cheaper options for college."", 'Situated near a beach, and the largest gym within the La Jolla area, there are many activities you can do at UCSD. There is a surplus of clubs and fraternities/sororities that are more than willing to have you join in their activities. The beach is only about a 10-20 minute walk from the campus, and completely available most of the days as La Jolla is constantly sunny; perfect weather for a swim. You can even join a surfing school near the campus and learn how to surf. The school even provides many events one can attend, such as plays, and the puppy walk where owners bring their dogs to the Giesel library to help the stress of final weeks. If you look for it, you can find almost anything at UCSD; you make college what it is.', 'Gifted with a cafeteria not more than a minute walk from the dorms, the food is very accommodating in UCSD. Judging based off the food in Cafe Ventanas, the school provides a variety of regional food that differs on the days of the week, and is of perfectly acceptable quality to most taste buds. However, if one were to eat there every say for a couple of weeks, you can easily get very tired of the food served. This is why UCSD provides many popular chains such as burger king, subway, and panda express within the college. There is also a farmers every Tuesday in which you can buy fresh produce and fresh food from the vendors there.', ""I've always heard of horror stories of college dorms and roommates, and I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case in the Eleanor Roosevelt dorms within UCSD. The dorms are very clean, as there is a cleaning lady that visits every week--and they do their job spectacularly well. However, contrary to the belief that UCSD is socially dead, in my personal experience, every floor has a couple of people who are very socially outgoing. This results in night parties that most likely will cut into your sleep time."", ""As I have mentioned, if you want to be intellectually challenged/stimulated, UCSD is the place for you. The professors are all wonderful people with a solid research or academic background, and all genuinely care for the student's education. Classes and tests are very fair in consideration of the academic prestige the school holds, and very manageable if you spend your time wisely."", ""If you love challenging yourself, and want a desirable environment with warm sunny days and the cold breeze of an ocean, UCSD is the perfect place for you. You can prosper easily in UCSD, just keep your priorities straight and make sure to study to keep up with the curves. While it may be hard to adjust to the college life at first, there are many staff within the school willing to aid you in your transition, so don't be afraid to ask for advice."", 'As always, college courses are vigorous, and being a part of the University of California system, UC San Diego is even more so. However, my time here has also been filled with an open and kind community, all of which are supportive. If I had to make a say, UCSD is definitely at least an 8 out of 10 in my book.']]","University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) (UCSD) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex",,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-San-Diego-UC-San-Diego/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1280,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,209,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00323-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,882140783,881922084,HORIZONTAL,"07/08/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 73 out of 75 people found this review useful. 1 of 255 Current Student from San Diego Area Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Personally, I was astonished at how easily I transitioned into the college life, and that in itself is worth it to me. The life experiences I will gain here could not be duplicated anywhere else. Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!!

The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy.

My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed.

It makes it difficult to meet up as often as I'd like, but I manage. You will meet a ton of diverse people from different backgrounds, and there is always something fun to do as long as you keep your mind open and actually attend events. Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.

Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

What can I say, I instantly fell in love with the campus when I toured it. It's a given that the SD weather is always perfect, no more needs to be said about that. Being here just makes me happy. The vibe you get from everyone is just so amazing. It makes me sad to see spirit lacking in some people, I don't think they realize what a great school UCSD is. However, you can definitely find that spirit if you look. Plus, there is some SERIOUS TALK about us turning all our sports teams into Division I, and a possibility of a Division I football team. Both of these are going on the ballot next year, and you can bet this will definitely come with some spirit, major! Join clubs! No matter who you are there is an organization for you!! There is truly a nice balance between academics and the other important college stuff, like being socially involved and and taking a part in the community. The college sends out student event fliers to let us know what's going on around the campus which is really helpful in deciding what you're going to do if you're feeling a little antsy. There are plenty of dances strategically planned around midterms and what not to provide a little extra entertainment.

As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt.

Besides, who isn't in debt these days, and isn't that why we go to college in the first place? To make money to pay off our debts? That's what loans and scholarships are for. So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that! Personally, within the third week of my Fall freshman quarter, I had a lab training position where I got PAID to learn how to work in a lab, and by Spring quarter, I will be helping a PhD with his graduate level research!!

So one of the reasons I feel like UCSD is worth the pain of reaching deep into our wallets is HELLO! it's one of the top research institutes in the nation!!! We have multiple Nobel Prize winners just walking around the campus everyday. We are one of the top nationally funded research schools and you should definitely take advantage of that!

Success, at least for the first year, depends mostly on the effort of the student to go the extra mile to get help from outside lecture hours, along with hours of studying.

You will meet a ton of diverse people from different backgrounds, and there is always something fun to do as long as you keep your mind open and actually attend events. Don't forget to look online at the cheap concerts that UCSD holds every so often. The Loft usually has some pretty good ones! Am learning a lot Teachers can be great, but you must go to class to actually learn. I never thought I'd be skipping classes, but it happens and I learned the hard way that this is NOT smart. Discussions with TAs can be incredibly helpful as well. I had a math class where I learned more from the TA than I did from the Professor, so it definitely helps to go to both to become a successful student at UCSD.

The campus police are probably comparable to many other campuses, and, in general, student safety is a high priority.', ""As stated earlier, UCSD campus life leaves a lot to be desired. It is located in La Jolla, California, a bedroom community for the rich and ultra conservative. Back in the day, when the school was being designed, these stalwart citizens complained about the possibility of having the same kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. The university's solution was to design a purposefully alienating campus that would discourage central student gatherings. The result is that students are sent all over the campus for their various classes, seldom seeing each other in any one location, and not having a great deal of opportunities for a collective social life. This is a pity, as campus life plays an important role in any college experience. I attended two other colleges before this, as I traveled with my husband, and both were a thousand times better when it came to activities and campus life. That being said, there are a wide variety of clubs in which to participate."", 'The campus is great for students whose emphasis is on obtaining a reasonably priced, but excellent education at the expense of a highly developed social life. I live locally, and because of familial obligations, attended UCSD, and am grateful for the high quality education. I do miss a more active campus social experience, however.', 'UCSD offers an excellent education for the price, but is hiking student fees to pay for higher ranking sports programs. Since the mandate is to educate the youth of California for a reasonable price, I find this pursuit of prestige at the cost of their student body distasteful. UCSD literally spent millions researching the pros for this program, and less than $50,000 researching the negative impacts on its financially disadvantaged students. Of course, they claimed that students would not be negatively impacted, and that financial aid would remain the same, but a close look shows that more financial aid will now be funneled to athletes who perform excellent athletics,and less will go to needy students who do a good job with their academics. In addition, despite all assurances to the contrary, the UC Regents recently voted for a 32% fee increasein the near future (aprox. 2-3 yrs.) I personally know two students who are going to be priced out of the college by this decision, students who have a right, by mandate, not to be priced out in favor of a athletes who can promote a flashy football team.', 'The campus does offer a variety of dining opportunities, but is sadly lacking in alternatives for vegetarians, with the exception of a pub that does offer a truly terrible eggplant burger, a Panda Express that does offer a vegetarian eggplant dish, and a curry place where you can obtain vegetarian dishes. A salad bar would go a long way, and is a logical addition for a young, and often health conscious student population. There are your normal junk food places like Burger King and a Pizza place, one pretty decent kiosk Greek food place, and a really overpriced juice bar. The convenience stores overcharge, as convenience stores are wont to do, but since boarding students are a semi-captive market, I find this offensive. The school rents the spaces to the vendors, and could demand that students not be ripped off, but it does not.', ""As I have stated, the academics are top notch, and the professors are, as a rule, excellent and engaged. Even the vast majority of the TA's have proven to be outstanding in my experience. However, keep in mind that lower level classes are very large, and most of the teaching will be done by TA's. As an alternative, you might consider going to a community college where all lower level courses are taught by full professors. Of course, the added bonus there is that you save a ton of money as well."", 'The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley.

Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed. The students here are crazy smart so there can be a lot of competition, however it is not impossible to get an A in most classes if you",True,0,0,"{250492=Revelle college has a tradition called the Watermelon Drop every year in June. They crown a Watermelon Queen (either gender), and they get to drop a watermelon off the roof of a building, aiming at a target on the ground. There is a small concert venue called the Che Cafe. There are many private concerts with beginner bands. It looks like a run-down shack, but the ambiance is comfortable and fun., 1048930=La Jolla Beach UTC Gas Lamp District Seaworld Mission Bay Old Town San Diego Balboa Park Del Mar Coronado Island, 880118=On campus, there are the gym facilities. Again like the food I would get off campus for the really world class recreation. If you are into martial arts, San Diego has a really famous fight community. Black House gym is right up Miramar Road and ATOS jiu jitsu is on Convoy. If you are more of a water sports type, the beach is a 5 minute walk away from the campus, 1126001=Great on Academics, mediocre on campus life, and truly terrible for students with disabilities. Parking for the handicapped is sparse, the transportation programs often make you late to class, and the Office for Students with Disabilities, while mainly staffed with great people, has a lady by the name of April Garrison who is evidently fond of making students obtain thousands of out of pocket dollars of extra testing despite the fact that they have doctors who state that they are in need of assistance. When I told her I did not have that kind of money, she callously suggested that I add to my already crippling student debt and borrow it. Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre. You get the eventual hair in your food or find something that doesnt look appetizing, but hey, its a cafeteria. Just t mention, Revelle will be going through cafeteria renovation, so for the 2013-2014 school year, we will not have a cafeteria., 853203=There are plenty of interesting locations around campus. There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College. Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",,

Areas at higher elevations, such as Thimphu and Paro, experience summers and winters much cooler than in the lowlands. Temperatures in Thimphu, located 7,218 feet above sea level in west-central Bhutan, range from approximately 59 to 78.8 degrees F during monsoon season (June through September) but drop to between about 24.8 and 60.8 degrees F in January., 94601=Tibet, due to its unique geographical characteristics, is cold in winter, cool in summer, and generally dry, receiving only 18 inches of rain or snow a year. Sunlight is extremely intense. The thin air neither blocks nor holds heat, so sunshine feels warm, shadows are chilly, and temperatures can vary greatly within a day, exceeding 84 degrees in summer, and plunging below 40 degrees the same night. Lhasa's nighttime lows in winter are around 16 degrees. The higher you go the colder it gets, and the winds in winter are ferocious. If you are traveling to Tibet in the months of November, December, January, February, or March, it is important to bring a warm winter jacket., 124683=NepalГўВЂВ™s weather is generally predictable. There are two seasonsГўВЂВ”the dry season from October to May and the rainy, monsoon season from June to September. About 80 percent of the rain falls during the rainy period, so the remainder of the year is relatively dry. Spring and autumn (March, April, and October) are the most pleasant seasons; winter temperatures drop to freezing with a high level of snowfall in the mountains. The hottest time of year is late spring and summer, when temperatures range from 83 degrees F in the hill regions to more than 104 degrees F in the Chitwan region. Humidity is generally high year round, comparable to Atlanta or San Francisco. The highest humidity is usually coincides with the rainy season from June or July through September., 241650=1-800-955-1925, 14164=Early January through early May; early July through late December, 15267=Partner since: 2009 ГўВЂВў Total donated: $7,670, 213447=In the wake of AprilГўВЂВ™s devastating earthquake, our hearts go out to the people of Nepal.

Patan was developed on relatively thin layers of deposited clay and gravel in the central part of a dried ancient lake known as Nagdaha. The city was designed in the shape of the Buddhist Dharma-Chakra (Wheel of Righteousness). The four thurs, or mounds, located on the perimeter of Patan are known as the Ashoka Stupas, named for Emperor Ashoka, who visited Kathmandu with his daughter, Charumati, in 250 BC and erected the five stupas. These mounds are joined by more than 1,200 Buddhist and Hindu monuments of various shapes and sizes located throughout the city.

The park lies in the subtropical inner Terai lowlands of South-Central Nepal. Designated as a World Heritage Site in 1984, the park covers a pristine area with a unique ecosystem of significant value to the world. It contains the Churiya hills, ox-bow lakes and flood plains of Rapti, Reu, and Narayani rivers. Formerly, the Chitwan Valley was well known for big-game hunting and until 1950 was exclusively managed as a hunting reserve for the Rana Prime Ministers and their guests. In 1963, the area south of the Rapti River was demarcated as a rhinoceros sanctuary. In 1970, His late Majesty King Mahendra approved, in principle, the creation of Royal Chitwan National Park.}"

GPM shows the relationship between sales and the direct cost of products/services sold. It measures the ability of both to control costs and to pass along price increases through sales to customers. The gross profit margin should be stable over time. A persistent gradual decrease is likely to indicate that productivity needs to be increased to return profitability back to previous levels.

"[['LIQUIDITY RATIOS:', 'Current Ratio CURRENT RATIOCURRENT RATIO, a comparison of current assets to current liabilities, is a commonly used measure of short-run solvency, i.e., the immediate ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. Current Ratio is particularly important to a company thinking of borrowing money or getting credit from their suppliers. Potential creditors use this ratio to measure a companys liquidity or ability to pay off short-term debts. Though acceptable ratios may vary from industry to industry below 1.00 is not atypical for high quality companies with easy access to capital markets to finance unexpected cash requirements. Smaller companies, however, should have higher current ratios to meet unexpected cash requirements. The rule of thumb Current Ratio for small companies is 2:1, indicating the need for a level of safety in the ability to cover unforeseen cash needs from current assets. Current Ratio is best compared to the industry. Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities', 'Quick Ratio QUICK RATIOQUICK RATIO (or Acid Test Ratio) is a more rigorous test than the Current Ratio of short-run solvency, the current ability of a firm to pay its current debts as they come due. This ratio considers only cash, marketable securities (cash equivalents) and accounts receivable because they are considered to be the most liquid forms of current assets. A Quick Ratio less than 1.0 implies ""dependency"" on inventory and other current assets to liquidate short-term debt. Formula: (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable) / Total Liabilities', 'Sales/Receivables SALES / RECEIVABLESSALES / RECEIVABLES (Receivables Turnover) is a ratio that measures the number of times trade Receivables turn over during the year. Generally, the higher the turnover of receivables, the shorter the time between sale and cash collection. It indicates how fast the company is getting paid for goods and services. Receivables turnover is best compared to the industry in order to determine if the company should improve their collection rate. The faster the receivables turnover, the better cash flow will look. Slow or below par turnover can be an indication of systemic problems within the company. It is best to compare receivables turnover with that of industry averages. Formula: Net Revenues / Accounts Receivable (net)', 'Gearing Ratio GEARING RATIOGEARING RATIO measures the percentage of capital employed that is financed by debt and long term financing. The higher the gearing, the higher the dependence on borrowing and long term financing. Whereas, the lower the gearing ratio, the higher the dependence on equity financing. Traditionally, the higher the level of gearing, the higher the level of financial risk due to the increased volatility of profits. Financial manager face a difficult dilemma. Most businesses require long term debt in order to finance growth, as equity financing is rarely sufficient, on the other hand, the introduction of debt and gearing increases financial risk. A high gearing ratio is positive; a large amount of debt will give higher return on capital employed but the company dependent on equity financing alone is unable to sustain growth. Gearing can be quite high for small businesses trying to become established, but in general they should not be higher than 50%.

"[['DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS:', 'Times Interest Earned TIMES INTEREST EARNEDTIMES INTEREST EARNED (TIE) measures the extent to which operating income can decline before the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. The TIE ratio is used by bankers to assess a firms ability to pay their liabilities. TIE determines how many times during the year the company has earned the annual interest costs associated with servicing its debt. Normally, a banker will be looking for a TIE ratio to be 2.0 or greater, showing that a business is earning the interest charges two or more times each year. A value of 1.0 or less suggests that the firm is not earning sufficient amounts to cover interest charges. Formula: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Charges', 'Equity Multiplier EQUITY MULTIPLIEREQUITY MULTIPLIER (EM) shows the amount of assets owned by the firm for each equivalent monetary unit owner claims held by stockholders, i.e., the equity multiplier measures how many dollars of assets an institution supports with each dollar of capital. If a firm is totally financed by equity, the equity multiplier will equal 1.00, while the larger the number the more highly leveraged is the firm. EM compares assets with equity: large values indicate a large amount of debt financing relative to equity. EM, thus, measures financial leverage and represents both profit and risk measurement. EM affects a firms profit because it has a multiplier impact on Return on Assets (ROA) to determine the firms Return on Equity (ROE). EM is also a risk measure because it reflects how many assets can go into default before a company becomes insolvent. The EM ratio is best compared to industry averages. Formula: Total Assets / Net Worth', 'Fixed Assets (net)/Net Worth FIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTHFIXED ASSETS (NET) / NET WORTH measures liquidity by comparing ""fixed"" assets with ""fixed"" capital. A lower ratio indicates proportionately smaller investment and a better ""cushion"" for creditors in case of liquidation. This may be important if the fixed assets are not easily used in other businesses. The presence of substantial leased fixed assets (not shown on the balance sheet) may deceptively lower this ratio. Therefore smaller is better, i.e., greater than .75 (75%) should merit caution.', 'Debt Ratio DEBT RATIODEBT RATIO measures the percent of total funds provided by creditors. Debt includes both current liabilities and long-term debt. Creditors prefer low debt ratios because the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors losses in liquidation. Owners may seek high debt ratios, either to magnify earnings or because selling new stock would mean giving up control. Owners want control while ""using someone elses money."" Debt Ratio is best compared to industry data to determine if a company is possibly over or under leveraged. The right level of debt for a business depends on many factors. Some advantages of higher debt levels are:The deductibility of interest from business expenses can provide tax advantages. Returns on equity can be higher.Debt can provide a suitable source of capital to start or expand a business.Some disadvantages can be:Sufficient cash flow is required to service a higher debt load. The need for this cash flow can place pressure on a business if income streams are erratic.Susceptibility to interest rate increases.Directing cash flow to service debt may starve expenditure in other areas such as development which can be detrimental to overall survival of the business. Formula: Total Liabilities / (Total Liabilities + Stockholders Equity)', 'Debt to Equity DEBT TO EQUITYDEBT TO EQUITY measures the risk of the firms capital structure in terms of amounts of capital contributed by creditors and that contributed by owners. It expresses the protection provided by owners for the creditors. In addition, low Debt/Equity ratio implies ability to borrow. While using debt implies risk (required interest payments must be paid), it also introduces the potential for increased benefits to the firms owners. When debt is used successfully (operating earnings exceeding interest charges) the returns to shareholders are magnified through financial leverage. Depending on the industry, different ratios are acceptable. The company should be compared to the industry, but, generally, a 3:1 ratio is a general benchmark. Should a company have debt-to-equity ratio that exceeds this number; it will be a major impediment to obtaining additional financing. If the ratio is suspect and you find the companys working capital, and current / quick ratios drastically low, this is a sign of serious financial weakness. Formula: Total Liabilities / Stockholders Equity', 'Long-term-debt to Equity LONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITYLONG-TERM DEBT TO EQUITY expresses the relationship between long-term capital contributions of creditors as related to that contributed by owners (investors). As opposed to DEBT TO EQUITY, Long-Term Debt to Equity expresses the degree of protection provided by the owners for the long-term creditors. A company with a high long-term debt to equity is considered to be highly leveraged. But, generally, companies are considered to carry comfortable amounts of debt at ratios of 0.35 to 0.50, or $0.35 to $0.50 of debt to every $1.00 of book value (shareholders equity). These could be considered to be well-managed companies with a low debt exposure. It is best to compare the ratio with industry averages.
