"[['Categories', 'Campus Safety', 'What to do for fun', 'Food and Dining', 'Dorm Life', 'Academic Rigor', 'Tips for prospective students'], ['Comments', 'Huntsville, Texas is known for being a prison town, as it houses several state prisons and pens. This leads to a common misconception that Sam is a dangerous school to attend. In actuality, prison breaks never happen, and the police force both in Huntsville and on campus are very present and helpful. Also, there are very few criminal incidents on campus as compared to other campuses.', ""There are a couple of good bars in town, as well as the infamous club Shenanigans. Personally, I have never been to Shenanigans, but my friends go frequently and seem to enjoy it. Otherwise, Huntsville does not have much else to offer. It is a small town, and there are a lot of families that reside there. However, Huntsville is situated about halfway between Houston and Dallas, and is roughly 2 1/2 hours from Austin. So, if you don't mind the drive, there are large cities with plenty of things to do!"", ""The dining experience at Sam isn't exactly a five-star experience, but it is decent. First-year students are required to purchase a meal plan, which allows you a certain number of swipes a week to use at the main dining hall, and it allots a certain amount of Bearkat Bucks, which you can use at on-campus places such as Starbucks, Chick-fil-a, Pizza Hut, Subway, and others. As for off-campus dining, make sure you try Farmhouse Cafe! It's affordable, great-tasting homestyle food, and the service is always great! It's quickly become a favorite spot of mine and my roommate's...we always hit up Farmhouse when we don't feel like eating on campus."", ""Again, it depends on what dorm you choose to live in. Sam Houston Village and Raven Village are some of the better ones, but they are more expensive than the others and are more difficult to get when you are a first-time freshman, as upperclassmen get first pick. Sam requires you to live on campus for your entire first year if you are an incoming freshman, but there are certain circumstances when they will waive this (you can find waiver eligibility online on their Housing page.) If you can waive this requirement, I would! I am already searching for apartments for my sophomore year, as I am beyond ready to get out of the dorms. However, overall, the dorms aren't too bad...some are older and need some serious updating, but for the most part they are all decent. It's just your dorm-mates you'll have to worry about...it's loud 24/7 in the dorms, so good luck studying in your room! I usually have to go to the library or one of the computer labs to get any work done."", ""How rigorous your classes are, of course, depends on the classes you take. For the most part, though, the classes are challenging and time-consuming. However, if you attend class regularly and do the required readings (most professors require a textbook, but there are some that don't), then you should be able to make great grades! I just finished out my first semester here with a 4.0 GPA (straight A's in all of my classes)."", 'Sam Houston currently automatically accepts students that are in the top 25 percentile of their graduating high school class, so make good grades while you are in high school!']]",Sam Houston State University (SHSU) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Sam-Houston-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/91944,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,250,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00196-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,905554543,905375362,HORIZONTAL,"07/23/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 58 out of 61 people found this review useful. 1 person found it offensive. 1 person found this inaccurate. 1 of 256 Katrina from Austin, TX Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Law Enforcement & Teaching come to mind., 270442=Sam Houston State University is a very welcoming and fun filled campus. Since being here I have enjoyed all the facilities and amenities offered for being a student. Even better the professor to student ratio is 3:1 and they really work hard to help the best way they can., 527035=Dorm life at SHSU is anything but typical. I personally have stayed in two different dorms, both of which were a pleasant experience. This past 2011-2012 school year, we celebrated the opening of brand new, semi-private dorm by the name of Lonestar Hall. This makes 26 halls, houses and on-campus apartments available for students to choose from. Some perks of staying in a dorm are a sense of community and safe living, along with all of the fun activities that residence life sets up. These activities vary from volley ball tournaments to movie nights to haunted houses., 1011764=Orientation on July 10-11, was quite informative; as a result my transition will be less frustrating. My advisor assisted me greatly, my scheduling wasn't as overwhelming as it could have been for a freshman. The campus is rich in diversity., 419152=Tuition runs about $1200 - 1500 a semester depending on how many classes you take and any additional fees for labs, etc. Very reasonable freshman to graduate level college., 211716=Even though I was on campus for a short while I really liked the different kinds of food offered and was impressed with how Old Main was. I know I'll be a fat kid when I start in August since I'll frequent Old Main a lot, also I'm content with the other food services offered in the LSC, 559376=If possible, try to get into the newer dorms because the older small house are small and cramped. Your best bet would be Sam Houston Village which was remodeled Summer 2012., 526012=Along with the addition of Lonestar residence hall, Old Main Market opened its doors for the 2011-2012 school year. All the food served by Old Main is provided by the Fresh Foods company, so Sam Houston is able to ensure safe, healthy food choices on campus. Beside Old Main Market, their are four more dining locations which house several eateries. Paw print is located in the heart of campus and houses a Quiznos, Burger King, and Chic-fil-a along with other random assortments of salads sandwiches and snacks. South Paw is at the South end of campus and houses a Starbucks, Tortilla Fresca, and Subway. We also have a Java City, and Einsteins Bagels on campus. Overall. dining experience on SHSU campus is fantastic and full of choices., 109203=SHSU has undergone many transformations from when I first was a freshmen in 2007. No longer will you walk campus and see a ton of other university t-shirts. You'll see our SHSU Orange. The traditions and spirit of campus are a growing fashion now., 56627=There is the ring ceremony for seniors that happens in April. They also light up a huge Christmas tree every January. Probably the coolest tradition is the Battle of the Piney Woods football game between Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin. The past three year the game has been held at Reliant Stadium where the Texans play., 70375=Food and Dining is pretty good! We have a new facility, Old Main Market that was built in the summer of 2011 which has a great variety of food. We also have other fast food places on campus, like Paw Print and South Paw. What ever your fix or crave, you can get it at Sam!, 1092731=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 506586=The battle of the Piney Woods is an old school rivalry between SHSU and SFA that has been going on since the 1920's. Both schools compete in different athletic sports to try to win the Piney Woods Trophy. In 1982 the Old Main Building on the North side of campus burned down. This Building was a beautiful gothic style mansion, it was the first permanent building constructed by the state for teacher training. Now known as the Old Main Pit it hosts many social gatherings., 1010225=I have not yet attended, I'm sharing what I have observed prior to August 26, 2013., 1082061=Hi, my name is Ashlee, and I've been accepted to Sam Houston for the Fall 2015 semester. I like to be very active in school and I have a wide variety of things I enjoy doing, and was planning on taking a tour of the school some time during January or February. Does anyone have any advice for me about the tour, regarding what kinds of questions to ask, what to request seeing and what I should pay close attention to, or just any other advice?}",

XML | CSV | Download as All Senate votes use these words. But the House of Representatives uses Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the Ã¢Â€Âœyeas and naysÃ¢Â€? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses Ã¢Â€ÂœyeaÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœnayÃ¢Â€? when voting on the final passage of bills. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€? mean the same thing, and so do Ã¢Â€ÂœNoÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€ÂœNayÃ¢Â€?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. Ã¢Â€ÂœAyeÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœYeaÃ¢Â€?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in Ã¢Â€Âœordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.Ã¢Â€? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The SpeakerÃ¢Â€Â™s Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments. Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market.

Effective July 1, 2014, the DJ-UBS Commodity Index name changed to Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return. From Feb. 3, 2006 (the Fund's exchange listing date) to May 24, 2006, the Fund sought to track the non- Optimum Yield version of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity IndexÃ¢Â„Â¢. From May 24, 2006, to Oct. 16, 2009, the Fund sought to track the Optimum Yield version of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity IndexÃ¢Â„Â¢. As of Oct. 19, 2009, the Fund commenced tracking the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index-Optimum Yield Diversified Excess ReturnÃ¢Â„Â¢ (the ""Interim Index""). Effective Jan. 1, 2011, the Fund commenced tracking DBIQ Opt Yield Diversified Comm Index ER (the ""Renamed Index"") (Symbol: DBLCIX). The Fund's Renamed Index is identical to the Interim Index except with respect to the name of Index. The inception date of January 2007 remains identical. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all prior underlying formulae, data (e.g., closing levels, measure of volatility, all other numerical statistics and measures) and all other characteristics (e.g., Base Date, Index Sponsor, inception date, rolling,etc.) with respect to the Renamed Index are identical to the Interim Index. The Index results from each discrete time period reflect the closing levels of each applicable index that the Fund tracked during the corresponding time period. The Fund's exchange listing date: Feb. 3, 2006. Unless otherwise noted, historical information of all displayed indexes is based on this date. The Fund seeks to track the excess return version of the Index (DBLCDBCE). Because the Fund collateralizes its futures positions with primarily US Treasuries, the results of the total return (DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Total ReturnÃ¢Â„Â¢) version of the Index (DBLCDBCT) are also displayed. With reference to the total return version Index history, it followed the same Index history as the excess return version except from Jan. 1, 2011, forward, where the performance shown is of the DBIQ Opt Yield Diversified Comm Index TR.
