For example, We had 77 Olympians and 71 NCAA National Championships,AP 18th Ranked Football Program, In 2013, we were in the Top 25 Ranked Men's Basketball Recruiting Class, In 2012 the Preseason Top 25 Ladies Softball Program, and last but not least we became the recent addition to the Big East Conference., 454303=The Campus Recreation & Wellness Center is great for students, there is a Multi-Million dollar facilities including 5 gyms (Basketball, Volleyball, & Badminton); an outdoor soccer field; indoor Olympic size swimming pool; outdoor recreation pool; weight room; and 3 group class studios.Students can rent out a locker in the locker room per semester or per year for a nominal fee. Membership to UH students is FREE. A important fact, when the Olympic board looked into Houston as a host city for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, our indoor facility was considered to host all Olympic swimming events! It is our are home of the University Intramural Office Flag Football, Basketball, Wii Sports, Badminton, Dodgeball and State difference between UH Club Sports and Intramural Sports!, 1063085=They will always send a text if its harmful to the entire student body, which happened once in 2013 even though it was a false alarm. Police are always there. I would say make sure your not flashing all the expensive things you have because people are watching. Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced. I only lived there out of convenience (close to classes, don't need to worry about paying utilities, etc.)., 863027=May be tough at times, but everyone needs a challenge to learn., 959174=By the start of the 2013-2014 school year there will be over 8,000 beds on the UH campus. That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in.

Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced.

Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in.

If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards. People collect more than what they need so that they can trade with other people, whether they know them or not. I love it. its like a huge game with the WHOLE campus!}",,"06/13/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I would suggest, a month prior to the start of the semester, to find someone who is also planning on attending the same school as you and that you are comfortable sharing a room with, and to request a two-person room with that person.

This will connect you with like-minded peers that are focused on their career and also boost your resume. When you feel stressed out, instead of getting drunk or high, go to the Recreation Center and let out that stress by exercising. Another tip to reduce stress: get at least 6 hours of sleep every night. And avoid distractions or people who will distract you from school work.', 'Most of the students are friendly and have school spirit, although the neighboring (ghetto) community is not ideal, considering the fact that someone stole my bike while I was on campus.

There are many Emergency telephone booths scattered all around campus in case someone needs to call for an emergency on campus and no one is around."", ""There are hundreds of different clubs on campus, it's crazy.

The only hard part is finding something that hasn't been done yet."", 'I love their Cougar Paw tradition.

If you're not in class, there's the Recreation and Wellness Center for you to work out or check up on yourself. There's food all over if all you want to do is try it. There's even the Religion center for those students who want to have fun in a more secluded, quiet way.

There are all sorts of dining facilities all around campus, and they just opened three different Food Trucks outside of the Student Center while some restaurants are being renovated. I haven't tried them personally but they're very popular either way."", ""I've spent a whole week in the dorms. The newest dorms are very clean. (I was lucky enough to have a room to myself.) The dormitories seem like a very homey place and everyone actually takes care of where they're living (which is a big surprise). The only thing is, the rooms get a bit cold at night and if you don't know how to work the air, you might get sick pretty quickly. Though I'm not going to be living on campus, I would definitely go to their Cougar Village dorms (freshmen only, sorry)."", ""Although the school might seem a bit easier than most to get into, each individual college has its own requirements. You may have to audition or have test scores completely separate from the ones you entered the school with. It has a more competitive surrounding within the campus itself, but you won't be overwhelmed by it."", ""Get everything done beforehand. If you have questions, go to the Welcome Center. There, they'll direct you on who to talk to about whatever you're wondering. If you already signed up for classes, a good thing to do is find them, explore campus.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in.

Needless to say, I'm only paying half of my tuition. Even though the Core Curriculum classes are sometimes hard, there are a variety of courses you can take to count as a core class.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas.

Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

Police are always there. I would say make sure your not flashing all the expensive things you have because people are watching. Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced. I only lived there out of convenience (close to classes, don't need to worry about paying utilities, etc.)., 863027=May be tough at times, but everyone needs a challenge to learn., 959174=By the start of the 2013-2014 school year there will be over 8,000 beds on the UH campus. That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in.

If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards. People collect more than what they need so that they can trade with other people, whether they know them or not.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in.

This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to.

Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced.

That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in. This could be a great experience for you, or it could be a horrible one. Things to take into consideration: Responsiveness, organization, availability, are the advisers worth their salt, what perks do they give you ex: help with internships, and ect., 370137=-Definitely apply for financial aid on time, try to get it in before April 1 -If your not comfortable with sharing public bathrooms with about 30 other girls than you might not want to live in Moody Towers. -DO NOT BUY YOUR BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE, I made the mistake of doing that my first semester and I wasted over $350., 142332=UH has earned every single one of those gold stars; experiences here have been so awesome that there is no need to sugar coat it. If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards. People collect more than what they need so that they can trade with other people, whether they know them or not.

The campus is not too big, so you can walk places if you don't mind the exercise. The people are great, the grounds are green, and there's quite a lot to do. Am learning a lot No matter what major you'll get into, you'll definitely learn a lot. There a many professors who care if you're actually learning or not and they will try to engage you as best as they can with the amount of students they have.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor.

If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards.

Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced. I only lived there out of convenience (close to classes, don't need to worry about paying utilities, etc.)., 863027=May be tough at times, but everyone needs a challenge to learn., 959174=By the start of the 2013-2014 school year there will be over 8,000 beds on the UH campus. That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in. This could be a great experience for you, or it could be a horrible one. Things to take into consideration: Responsiveness, organization, availability, are the advisers worth their salt, what perks do they give you ex: help with internships, and ect., 370137=-Definitely apply for financial aid on time, try to get it in before April 1 -If your not comfortable with sharing public bathrooms with about 30 other girls than you might not want to live in Moody Towers. -DO NOT BUY YOUR BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE, I made the mistake of doing that my first semester and I wasted over $350., 142332=UH has earned every single one of those gold stars; experiences here have been so awesome that there is no need to sugar coat it. If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading.

There a many professors who care if you're actually learning or not and they will try to engage you as best as they can with the amount of students they have. I'm in the Honors College and it's crazy. I've learned much about philosophy and literature while there for the mandatory Human Situation class.

It is our are home of the University Intramural Office Flag Football, Basketball, Wii Sports, Badminton, Dodgeball and State difference between UH Club Sports and Intramural Sports!, 1063085=They will always send a text if its harmful to the entire student body, which happened once in 2013 even though it was a false alarm. Police are always there. I would say make sure your not flashing all the expensive things you have because people are watching. Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced. I only lived there out of convenience (close to classes, don't need to worry about paying utilities, etc.)., 863027=May be tough at times, but everyone needs a challenge to learn., 959174=By the start of the 2013-2014 school year there will be over 8,000 beds on the UH campus. That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in. This could be a great experience for you, or it could be a horrible one. Things to take into consideration: Responsiveness, organization, availability, are the advisers worth their salt, what perks do they give you ex: help with internships, and ect., 370137=-Definitely apply for financial aid on time, try to get it in before April 1 -If your not comfortable with sharing public bathrooms with about 30 other girls than you might not want to live in Moody Towers. -DO NOT BUY YOUR BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE, I made the mistake of doing that my first semester and I wasted over $350., 142332=UH has earned every single one of those gold stars; experiences here have been so awesome that there is no need to sugar coat it. If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to. Despite the scorching heat from June to September, the scenery is beautiful year around, i.e. all the squirrels and varieties of birds and trees that live on the campus grounds. Academically, the University is made up of a broad variety of colleges all of which each offer several degrees and programs., 873784=UH is constantly upgrading. They are building two new dorms that are too open Fall 2013., 979309=The stadium isn't said to be complete till 2014 so there are no football games on campus till then. However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards. People collect more than what they need so that they can trade with other people, whether they know them or not. I love it. its like a huge game with the WHOLE campus!}",,"06/13/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester.

Make sure you walk in large groups and try leaving campus by 5 PM because its usually after that crimes happen, and you don't want to be a victim., 616725=If your a freshman, then try your best to sign up to live in Cougar Village. That's the best dorm on campus and it's only for freshmen. It was built very recently and they're even building another one which will open in Fall 2013. Cougar Village consists of suites. There are two rooms and a bathroom in each suite. Most of the suites have double rooms but a few have single rooms. Each floor is divided into North and South. Each half of the floor also has a kitchen, a lounge area with a TV, and two study areas. If you're not a freshman, the the Quadrangle and Moody Towers are your other options.I can;t rate the Quads because I haven't lived there but they are pretty run down from the exterior. Moody Towers is old but is always fixed up from time to time. It's more like the traditional dor. Several rooms and a floor with a large communal bathroom on each floor. The have both double and single rooms which are reasonably priced. Downstairs is the biggest cafeteria on campus, Fresh Food Company, which is open from 7am-10pm/12am depending on the day. There is a computer lab downstairs., 834433=I currently live in the Calhoun Lofts, but I am moving off-campus next semester. The Calhoun Lofts are apartments that cost $1000 per month and are comically small. They're nice, but MAJORLY overpriced.

That would consist of approximately 20% of the total UH student body. Because such a large number of students live on campus, there are plenty of activities to be apart of throughout the year., 867124=Underwear-run 2012 occurred on election night. students get down to their undies and run around the campus. Saw way too much skin, but hey, it's college., 30025=Apply early. Honestly. If you go in for the quick apply in November you find out that day if you are accepted or not. Takes a load off your mind. Take dual credit classes, don't necessarily rely on your AP scores to count. I know a student here who scored 4's or 5's on all 6 of his AP tests and only 3 of them counted towards anything. Dual credit is a lot less stressful and you're pretty much guaranteed college credit. Also I can not stress this enough, but look into this school and your will be department before you make your choice. This is a good idea to apply this to whatever school you are interested in. This could be a great experience for you, or it could be a horrible one. Things to take into consideration: Responsiveness, organization, availability, are the advisers worth their salt, what perks do they give you ex: help with internships, and ect., 370137=-Definitely apply for financial aid on time, try to get it in before April 1 -If your not comfortable with sharing public bathrooms with about 30 other girls than you might not want to live in Moody Towers. -DO NOT BUY YOUR BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE, I made the mistake of doing that my first semester and I wasted over $350., 142332=UH has earned every single one of those gold stars; experiences here have been so awesome that there is no need to sugar coat it. If you march in a high school band right now, I HIGHLY recommend continuing marching band here (we get a nice band grant every fall semester, just saying). There's too much to say about how awesome it was just during the first week. Just the people and the atmosphere alone are great reasons to be here. This campus and a vast majority of the people in it are genuine and welcoming ( I lost my iTouch in the middle of campus one day and it was turned in to UHPD instead of being stolen). There are always activities going on around the campus, and the food at Moody Towers is nothing short of yummy and satisfying., 1133561=What stands out most about the University of Houston is that it is by far the most ethnically diverse school that I have been to.

However, there are still basketball games, baseball games, night life on campus, an underground arcade, plays, and special events., 1110462=There are so few eating options it's not funny. And with the few choices there is, the food is so expensive. The only place to eat as of 2013 is the UC satellite, and then the dorm dining halls. Most people just eat taco bell because it is the cheapest thing there is. In fact so many people eat there that if you go during peak hours you can stand in line for like 20 minutes, 160737=A new dorm for freshmen was recently built (opened in 2010) and it's being added onto, which will open Fall 2013. The building is very nice. There are two other dorm facilities, neither of which lives up to the grandeur of the new dorm. In terms of dorm life (as far as activities go), there isn't a whole lot to do. It really depends on who the RA's are and how much they schedule for the residents., 925197=my favorite little UH specialty are what is called Cougar Cards. these cards are like trading cards of the UH staff. When you collect all of the cards you get a 1000 dollar scholarship. I love it because it forces you to get involved on campus. In order to get the cards you have to attend certain events and participate in certain activities. It gets really crazy and competitive when it comes to these cards.

Like any university would suggest, you should always travel in pairs.

Anything can happen to anyone no matter where you are, so you need to pay attention to your environment. University of Houston has safety awareness by supplying on call campus police, ambulances, help buttons located all over campus and electronic contact/notification for student safety alerts. I am glad to say though, even though University of Houston has a robbery problem, there has not been any shootings or deaths.

The interim final rules made permanent the direct fee payment rules for eligible non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act and for attorney representatives under title XVI of the Act. They also revised some of our eligibility policies for non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act. Based on public comment and subsequent inquiries, we are revising our rules to clarify that an eligible non-attorney representative's liability insurance policy must include malpractice coverage.

The revisions reflect our program experience and guidance we have issued in response to adjudicator questions we have received since we last revised these criteria in 2006. These revisions will provide clarification about how we evaluate visual disorders and ensure more timely adjudication of claims in which we evaluate visual disorders that result in a loss of visual acuity or field., 81044=We are extending the expiration date of our rules that authorizes State agency disability examiners to make fully favorable determinations without the approval of a State agency medical or psychological consultant in claims that we consider under our quick disability determination (QDD) and compassionate allowance (CAL) processes. The current rules will expire on November 12, 2013. In this final rule, we are changing the November 12, 2013 expiration or Ã¢Â€ÂœsunsetÃ¢Â€? date to November 14, 2014, extending the authority for 1 year. We are making no other substantive changes, although we are making minor, nonsubstantive editorial changes to the rule for clarity., 44344=We are extending for one year our pilot program that authorizes the agency to set the time and place for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). Extending the pilot program continues our commitment to improve the efficiency of our hearing process and provide accurate, high-quality decisions for claimants.

We are replacing those listings with new listings for low birth weight (LBW) and failure to thrive; a new listing for genitourinary impairments; and revised listings for growth failure in combination with a respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, or immune system disorder.

This rule freezes the modified adjusted gross income threshold and ranges from 2011 through 2019 and removes the requirement that beneficiaries consent to our release of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the purpose of adjudicating any appeal of an IRMAA to the Part B premium subsidy. We are also removing provisions that phased in IRMAA between 2007 and 2009 and updating a citation to reflect the transfer of authority for hearing appeals under Title XVIII of the Act from the Social Security Administration to HHS., 113050=This final rule is another step in our continual efforts to handle workloads more effectively and efficiently. We are publishing final rules for portions of the rules we proposed in October 2007 that relate to persons, other than the claimant or any other party to the hearing, appearing by telephone. We are also clarifying that the administrative law judge (ALJ) will allow the claimant or any other party to a hearing to appear by telephone under certain circumstances when the claimant or other party requests to make his or her appearance in that manner. We expect that these final rules will make the hearings process more efficient and help us continue to reduce the hearings backlog.

The interim final rules made permanent the direct fee payment rules for eligible non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act and for attorney representatives under title XVI of the Act. They also revised some of our eligibility policies for non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act. Based on public comment and subsequent inquiries, we are revising our rules to clarify that an eligible non-attorney representative's liability insurance policy must include malpractice coverage. We are also reaffirming that a business entity legally permitted to provide the required insurance in the States in which the non-attorney representative conducts business must underwrite the policies., 30987=This document corrects a misspelling in the regulatory language of our final rulemaking published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 10, 2014, titled Revised Medical Criteria for Evaluating Genitourinary Disorders., 139278=100 Stat. 1970, 62921=This final rule adopts, without change, the interim final rule with request for comments we published in the Federal Register on September 18, 2013. The interim final rule modified our rules regarding Medicare Part B income-related monthly adjustment amounts to conform to changes made to the Social Security Act (Act) and Internal Revenue Code by the Affordable Care Act. We also removed provisions that phased in income-related monthly adjustment amounts between 2007 and 2009 and updated a citation to reflect the transfer of authority for hearing appeals under title XVIII of the Act from the Social Security Administration to the Department of Health and Human Services., 117878=We are revising and reorganizing the criteria in the Listing of Impairments (listings) that we use to evaluate cases involving visual disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (Act). The revisions reflect our program experience and guidance we have issued in response to adjudicator questions we have received since we last revised these criteria in 2006. These revisions will provide clarification about how we evaluate visual disorders and ensure more timely adjudication of claims in which we evaluate visual disorders that result in a loss of visual acuity or field., 81044=We are extending the expiration date of our rules that authorizes State agency disability examiners to make fully favorable determinations without the approval of a State agency medical or psychological consultant in claims that we consider under our quick disability determination (QDD) and compassionate allowance (CAL) processes.

We are replacing those listings with new listings for low birth weight (LBW) and failure to thrive; a new listing for genitourinary impairments; and revised listings for growth failure in combination with a respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, or immune system disorder.

This rule freezes the modified adjusted gross income threshold and ranges from 2011 through 2019 and removes the requirement that beneficiaries consent to our release of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the purpose of adjudicating any appeal of an IRMAA to the Part B premium subsidy.

We are publishing final rules for portions of the rules we proposed in October 2007 that relate to persons, other than the claimant or any other party to the hearing, appearing by telephone. We are also clarifying that the administrative law judge (ALJ) will allow the claimant or any other party to a hearing to appear by telephone under certain circumstances when the claimant or other party requests to make his or her appearance in that manner.

The interim final rules made permanent the direct fee payment rules for eligible non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act and for attorney representatives under title XVI of the Act. They also revised some of our eligibility policies for non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act. Based on public comment and subsequent inquiries, we are revising our rules to clarify that an eligible non-attorney representative's liability insurance policy must include malpractice coverage. We are also reaffirming that a business entity legally permitted to provide the required insurance in the States in which the non-attorney representative conducts business must underwrite the policies., 30987=This document corrects a misspelling in the regulatory language of our final rulemaking published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 10, 2014, titled Revised Medical Criteria for Evaluating Genitourinary Disorders., 139278=100 Stat. 1970, 62921=This final rule adopts, without change, the interim final rule with request for comments we published in the Federal Register on September 18, 2013.

The revisions reflect our program experience and guidance we have issued in response to adjudicator questions we have received since we last revised these criteria in 2006.

The interim final rules made permanent the direct fee payment rules for eligible non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act and for attorney representatives under title XVI of the Act. They also revised some of our eligibility policies for non-attorney representatives under titles II and XVI of the Act. Based on public comment and subsequent inquiries, we are revising our rules to clarify that an eligible non-attorney representative's liability insurance policy must include malpractice coverage. We are also reaffirming that a business entity legally permitted to provide the required insurance in the States in which the non-attorney representative conducts business must underwrite the policies., 30987=This document corrects a misspelling in the regulatory language of our final rulemaking published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 10, 2014, titled Revised Medical Criteria for Evaluating Genitourinary Disorders., 139278=100 Stat. 1970, 62921=This final rule adopts, without change, the interim final rule with request for comments we published in the Federal Register on September 18, 2013.
