At that time, a mobile telecom operator (we'll call it FlawedPhone.com) launched a webmail+SMS service for its customers, with the following characteristics:, 15113=4.12.4 Test Integrity Checks (OTG-BUSLOGIC-004) 4.12.5 Test Tamper Evidence (OTG-BUSLOGIC-005) 4.12.6 Test Excessive Rate (speed) of Use Limits (OTG-BUSLOGIC-006) 4.12.7 Test for Process Timing (OTG-BUSLOGIC-007) 4.12.8 Test Size of Request Limits (OTG-BUSLOGIC-008) 4.12.9 Test Number of Times a Function Can be Used Limits (OTG-BUSLOGIC-009) 4.12.10 Test bypass of Correct Sequence (OTG-BUSLOGIC-0010) 4.12.11 Testing for the Circumvention of Work Flows (OTG-BUSLOGIC-0011) 4.12.12 Test Self-Hosted Payment Cardholder Data Processing (OTG-BUSLOGIC-012) 4.12.13 Test Security Incident Reporting Information (OTG-BUSLOGIC-013) 4.12.14 Test Defenses Against Application Mis-Use (OTG-BUSLOGIC-014) 4.12.15 Test Upload of Unexpected File Types (OTG-BUSLOGIC-015) 4.12.16 Test Upload of Malicious Files (OTG-BUSLOGIC-016), 19472=Business logic can have security flaws that allow a user to do something that isn't allowed by the business. For example, if there is a limit on reimbursement of $1000, could an attacker misuse the system to request more money than it is intended? Or, perhaps, users are supposed to do operations in a particular order, but an attacker could invoke them out of sequence. Or can a user make a purchase for a negative amount of money? Frequently, these business logic checks simply are not present in the application.}","Consider the following privileges: ""Approve expense report"", ""Book a conference room"", ""Transfer money from own account to another user's account"". A privilege could be thought of as a combination of a verb (e.g., Approve, Book, Withdraw) and one or more nouns (e.g., Expense report, conference room, account). The output of this activity is a grid with the various privileges forming the leftmost column, while all user roles and groups would form the column headings of other columns. There would also be a Ã¢Â€ÂœCommentsÃ¢Â€? column that qualifies data in this grid. What are the policies across groups? What can each user role do on which resource with what constraint(s)? This will help you in deducing who cannot do what on which resource. Privilege Table Ã¢Â€Â“ After learning about the various privileges on the resources along with the constraints, you are all set to create a Privilege Table. Get answers to: Access rights of various user roles and groups - The application allows various user privileges on some resource (or asset) and we need to specify the constraints of these privileges. One simple way to know these business rules/constraints is to make use of the application documentation effectively. For example, look for clauses like ""If the administrator allows individual user access.."", ""If configured by the administrator.."" and you know the restriction imposed by the application.","This data is a key input for designing logical tests. Developing logical tests Here are several guidelines to designing logical tests from the raw data gathered. Privilege Table - Make use of the privilege table as a reference while creating application-specific logical tests. In general, develop a test for each admin privilege to check if it could be executed illegally by a user role with less privileges or no privilege. For example: Privilege: Operations Manager cannot approve a customer order Logical Test: Operations Manager approves a customer order Improper handling of special user action sequences - Navigating through an application in a certain way or revisiting pages out of sync can cause logical errors which may cause the application to do something it's not meant to. For example: A wizard application where one fills in forms and proceeds to the next step. One cannot in any normal way (according to the developers) enter the wizard in the middle of the process. Bookmarking a middle step (say, step 4 of 7), then continuing with the other steps until completion or form submission, then revisiting the middle step that was bookmarked may ""upset"" the back-end logic due to a weak state model. Cover all business transaction paths - While designing tests, check for alternate ways to perform the same business transaction. For example, create tests for",True,0,0,,
