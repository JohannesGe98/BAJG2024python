It can be overwhelming at first but get involved! As a freshman I joined AAF Mizzou, the advertising club on campus and served as the only freshman on the executive board as the secretary. I got to help older students with a national competition, visit companies in my field, and learn from current professionals. This up coming year I will be serving on the executive board as Assistant Vice President of Public Relations. Joining clubs and getting involved makes the campus feel small and eventually like home. I am also a part of Greek Life on campus. I can honestly say that I love my sorority and have met so many people from all over the country because of joining. Its another great way to get involved because it's own little community. If going Greek is not something you're interested in, no big deal! There is plenty to do on and off campus for a social life. Downtown is awesome! Plenty of restaurants and 18 and older bars and dance clubs."", 'The University of Missouri is a huge financial and academic commitment but is has been the best commitment I have made so far in my life. There are several top notch degree programs and colleges on campus. If you are thinking about being a Journalism major it is THE best school to go to. I was automatically accepted into the School of Journalism...it has been the best experience. As a freshman I have learned so much about the industry, learned how to network, and learned how to set myself up for success as a journalist. The professors have all been successful professionals in their field and have so much to teach future journalist. As a freshman this past year I was in a Freshman Interest Group, that helped me meet people on my dorm floor and get involved. Through this group I volunteered at a retirement home close to campus, I suggest to anyone and everyone to volunteer somewhere. I loved spending my time at the retirement home.

If you can get your own place after your first year I recommend doing it as it will save you quite a lot of money. I also recommend summer classes at a community college if its necessary that you take them, as they are much cheaper that what you would pay here for the same amount of credit hours. While Mizzou is really expensive, I believe they do put their money to good use. The campus is huge and the buildings are beautiful-especially the new student center and the bookstore. The Rec center is another great big place your money is spent on and it shows; the equipment and facilities are all top notch. Mizzou has also been doing a lot of remodeling lately, so they are trying to make the campus a nicer place. Most of the dorms have been remodeled already and some are still on the list. The only thing about the dorms you maybe upset about is the lack of space, but hey-its college and that's pretty much expected. At least everything is clean and new."", ""I love Columbia and Mizzou. There is a lot to do here and the student groups are always putting events on for the students. You'll feel especially welcomed here in the beginning of the year, as there are plenty of events to get you integrated into new college life. The bottom line pretty much is there is always something to do. And for the party people out there, you'll never be bored with the night life. There are plenty of clubs and Greek parties to keep you satisfied if that's what you like to do."", ""There are a lot of grad students teaching classes here, especially at the lower level classes. They know what they are talking about thankfully, but some don't really know how to get the information across. Can't say I've been too impressed about that, although there are some grad. instructors that I would absolutely recommend (esp. in the classics department), so its kind of a 50/50 when it comes to grad instructors. I haven't been too impressed with the psychology grad instructors at all though. But graduate students aren't always a bad thing, and the larger your school is, the more of them there are likely to be. Its really only the lower level classes that they teach at, so as you move up in your college career, the more likely you are to have experienced instructors. But of course your experiences with each one will always be different. There really is a wide range of okay to amazing here and thankfully I have yet to run into any downright 'bad.' One of the best things though is that most of the faculty is always available. They actually want to talk to you and they like to hear what you have to say. If you are ever having any trouble or if you just downright don't understand something, chances are they're going to want to help you out.

Mizzou has also helped me gain confidence in my studies, before I was a constant C- math student always ruining my A/B's with that one C in math, but thanks to the Learning Center ( a student oriented, free tutoring service) they paired me with the perfect tutor who was willing to go above and beyond and helped me come out of Algebra with a new appreciation for the subject.

The best way to achieve this is to find a man hole that is covered by grates, but beware of the alarm system. 3.kiss the 50-yard line at Faurot field that is named after coach Don Faurot. In order to do this you need to figure out how to get through the locked gate, but rumor has it that there are silent motion sensors on the field. 4.Streaking across the Quad is the fourth tradition. The only way to approach this to build up the courage and to not look back. 5.ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza. The tiger is roughly around 11 feet tall. When climbing the tiger, it is best to have someone help you up. You can get extra points for having more people on the tiger at one time. 6.swim in Brady Foundation located in Tiger Plaza as well. Just putting your toes in the foundation doesn√¢\x80\x99t count you must go all in. If you extra points then you can swim laps in it. 7.scream √¢\x80\x9cI love Mizzou√¢\x80? in Speaker Circle.

As a journalism student I can also warn future Journalism majors that they charge an extra fee for each journalism class you enroll in. That and the University has a monopoly on the journalism books so they, along with any textbook you get from the University will be expensive."", 'My friends and I hang out at each others dorms, go to shows hosted by campus, parties hosted by the Mizzou After Dark committee. We wonder around downtown Columbia, just walking distant from the campus or we will drive to the Columbia mall.', 'The running joke on campus is that it is not the Freshman 15 but instead the Mizzou 22. Our food on campus is fantastic and there are always lots of options at all 4 of our dining halls. We also have a eastern asian restaurant and a mexican restaurant. There are little convince stores where you can use your mean points to buy chips, yogurt, pizza and other to-go items. We even have a Late Night Americano order restaurant open for late night munchies.', ""I lived in Galena, one of the newer dorms and I loved them. My best friend lived in one of the older dorms, McDavid that was on the edge of campus while I was at the center. Dorm life itself, even in the older dorms can be fun and is safe. The issue I have with ResLife is that there aren't enough rooms for the amount of students they have on campus. I was put in a converted study room and was charged full price for a standard double. It put a damper on my college experience at first but my roommate and I made the best of it and we loved our room."", 'As a journalism major already in major-related courses, I can openly tell you that some of the courses are hard, and there to try to scare you away from the more rigorous majors. At the same time some the basic gen eds can complete jokes and it shows when only a fifth of the class actually shows up on non-exams day.', 'Try to get to know people as soon as possible and get involved as soon as you can. There are 30,000 + students on campus and it can make you feel alone at times. However, if you make at least a few good friends this can be amazing campus and school with lots of spirit and loyalty and memories just waiting to be made.', 'Lost of students here, meaning lots of opportunities, lots of competition and lots of being just another face.

Although tuition has increased this past year due to state budget cuts, school administration is committed to keeping cost of attendance down to make affording an education there attainable to most. For those needing extra financial help, I recommend applying for as many scholarships as you can. There are scholarship offered through the school for incoming freshman, continuing students, and different departments. Also, there are on campus jobs for students. I emphasize strongly, it is important with any money you get you need to manage it wisely.', 'There is always something going on on campus or in Columbia. There are events the Greeks put on, concerts, plays, and our amazing Rec Center. You can take classes there, get massages, go swimming, rock climb, and oh yeah workout. Admittance for students is free but classes and massages are paid for. Football and basketball game weekends are extremely popular but you must pay for them. All other sports students receive free admittance. In the Student Center, there is a place called The Shack where students can come and play Kinect, pool, and foosball.', ""Whether or not you have a meal plan is up to you. Using your meal plan at dining hall is a full meal, using it at various other campus eateries counts as partial meals. Meals don't carry over to the next semester so use them or lose them. In the dining halls, there are a lot of tasty foods and most are not too unhealthy. A downside is the few food options if you are a vegetarian or vegan. Since there are so many students, at some dining halls there can be long waits just to just get in and then an even longer waits for some lines. There are plenty of restaurants not far in downtown Columbia if you're not in the mood for dining hall food. Also, there are places on campus where you can pick up food like deli sandwiches, Asian cuisine, baked goods, and etc."", 'Never use the word dorm around the housing staff. On campus housing facilities are referred to as residence halls. This is because dorm is a variant of a French word meaning to sleep and staff wants to emphasize the experience in the residence halls should be more than about just sleeping. Every hall has learning communities such as education, engineering, pangea (pairs foreign and local students as roommates), and general. For incoming freshman, there are groups called FIGS which are learning communities that help freshman of similar majors get acquainted with one another. I am unable to elaborate on the experience of being in a FIG since I was not involved in one myself. Housing staff has implemented programs like this and others because they want students to feel they are part of a community. If you live in a residence hall with many floors I suggest you try to live on a floor near the first level. In my experience, the elevators stopped about once every week and that can be annoying when you are in a rush to class. Cost of living in on campus housing is relatively high due to its convenience. Another expense is laundry. It costs a $1.25 to wash and another $1.25 to dry. Even though it can be costly, on campus living can be nice because most halls are comfortable, kept clean, look nice, and have the close to class convenience.', ""Classes I've had at Mizzou have been pretty straightforward. You have class then you have assignments which include homework (mostly online), quizzes, and exams. Most of my professors held PhD's and were well informed. How difficult a class is depends on the class, teacher, and mainly what you are skilled at. There are plenty of resources available for help to students that are struggling. Teachers are accessible and free student tutoring services are available. It is very important to attend class, study, and to stay on top of you work. You can get a quality education but you have to be willing to put in the time an effort necessary to attain it. The atmosphere of Mizzou is conducive to learning which helps make an enjoyable academic experience."", ""Some of the best advice I can give is to have goals, have a plan for how you are going to stick to those goals, adjust them when necessary, and stay on track with what is important. Even though it can have a smaller feel Mizzou is a large campus with over 30,000 students. Class sizes can be pretty large if they pertain to areas such as social science, humanities, or general education. At least one professor you have as an undergraduate student is going to be foreign with an accent that may be hard to understand. If you run into this problem try and find a student that does understand them or go see them during office hours to listen to them more and see if understanding them becomes easier. Make connections with those that have the right mindsets for success. Strive for a high GPA your first year and aim to keep it high. That first year is very important because it can set a tone for how you do in following years. Also, there are many resources and opportunities including both academic and extra-curricular so take advantage of them. Don't get over involved though; remember as a student, school is your main priority."", ""At Mizzou you can get the ultimate college experience.

There is so much to do at Mizzou I can barely touch base on it, every club you can think of is there, and even some that might peak your interest in something new.

Mizzou has a great general education requirement that allowed me to take classes that were outside my major and I primarily had no interest in, that opened my eyes to other opportunities and actually lead me to change my major to biology based on my general requirement class and how much I enjoyed the subject and the professors. Mizzou has also helped me gain confidence in my studies, before I was a constant C- math student always ruining my A/B's with that one C in math, but thanks to the Learning Center ( a student oriented, free tutoring service) they paired me with the perfect tutor who was willing to go above and beyond and helped me come out of Algebra with a new appreciation for the subject. Of course what is college with out your extracurricular and social life?

My mom would easily trust me going there and being totally fine. But never walk around unprepared - at any college something could happen so just be prepared. There are emergency stations everywhere on the campus and a police officer will be there from what i've heard to be under a minute tops. It is a safe campus - but if you have the choice you should still walk with someone if it's extremely late and dark outside and you have a long way to go."", ""The biggest thing at Mizzou is Football and Cheerleading. For both of these you must be really good. Trust me on the Cheerleading portion, because i'm one myself and i know the head coach of the cheer team and the one who choreograph's their routine's each year. I could make the competitive squad easily because i'm a competitive All-Star Cheerleader. Now if you're not into either of those, there are plenty of other things you can take part in ranging from Ping-pong club, to lacrosse or something. You can find anything you want to do, and if they don't have it you can make a club."", ""This place is great for the two kinds of students: Partier: the partier can have a great time as I've been told and can have a fun time while still getting a good education. Non-Partier: like me i'm not a partier and though i like to have fun those types of scenes don't amuse me. Therefore, on campus there are other great places to hang out and have a good times with friends. Or if you're like a book worm like me you will aboslutely LOVE THE LIBRARY! it's fabulous!"", 'The football games are off the chain! they are amazing to go to - if your not a cheerleader or a player - you will have an amazing time hanging with your friends in the stands. Especially now that Mizzou has gone up into a higher division, there will be even MORE chaos going on! Mizzou also has bands that come in and they have streets blocked off to have a party. They also have man clubs that people can join along with an amazing REC center that they just recently done up!', ""The food as i said previously is absolutely delicious! And don't forget to check out Shakespeare's pizza!"", ""The dorms are a great place and many of the people keep their doors open when they're there to meet new people on their floor & in the building."", ""From what i've heard and seen, the studies that people take are complex but not so hard that you must be a rocket scientist to be able to pass English. It's hard enough to keep you on your toes."", ""Talk to the people there because they are many people that I know personally and they are all good people that will help you out. Also enjoy your food there because other colleges in St. Louis don't have that best set of food. You will love this school if you get involved in sports and clubs and anything else; just get to know people and you will make friends fast! Ooh! there's this awesome pizza joint called Shakespeare's that you need to go to on your first night because it is amazing! It get's a little crowded because it's so popular but it's worth any wait time. Just make sure you talk to the people in your classroom because if your a freshman going in; most likely everyone else is and they are all in the same boat as you. As well get food for your room and stuff that you can cook because i do know for a fact that in some of the halls there are kitchens so you can actually make your food in a stove rather than a microwave (Though the kitchens do have those too)."", 'The University is an open place that makes you feel welcome.

Mizzou has also helped me gain confidence in my studies, before I was a constant C- math student always ruining my A/B's with that one C in math, but thanks to the Learning Center ( a student oriented, free tutoring service) they paired me with the perfect tutor who was willing to go above and beyond and helped me come out of Algebra with a new appreciation for the subject.

The residency requirements for Missouri are one of the easiest in the nation and after you achieve in state status it can work out to be less than your in-state school (ie. U of Illinois). I will say diversity scholarships are by far the easiest and most available scholarships to get but if you don√É\x83√Ç¬¢√É\x82?√É\x82?t qualify for those some searching on the web for department specific scholarships or looking at outside sources can help meet this gap.', 'For fun events there is a huge range depending on what you are interested in.

For those who are interested in other activities you can play sport like sand volleyball or soccer (field lights are on till 2 A.M.), see performances at the Blue Note or other venus, watch a free movie provided weekly by Mizzou, do craft events at Mizzou After Dark, or hang out in the dorms with friends.', 'AMAZING!!!

It is a large transition from high school in that your teachers will not make an effort to help you first and there are only a couple of assigments/test that will make up your entire grade. However, if you take the time in the beginning of the semester to mark down important due dates in your assignment book and study accordingly you shouldn√É\x83√Ç¬¢√É\x82?√É\x82?t have an issue with your grades.', 'If you can come here with your major in mind or at least a possible major you are willing to declare do it because it will boost your chances for scholarships immensely. Also, AP scores are accepted here and can save you thousands of dollars if you take enough in high school. While other schools might not take them Mizzou does (google their score requirements) so take as many as you can while you can I promise it will be worth it!!

Join clubs or do intramural sports, its a great way to relieve stress and to do something you enjoy while networking and meeting new people. Use your resources- YOU ARE PAYING FOR SCHOOL, and basically a lot of salaries around there so don't let anyone a professor, TA or tutor take advantage of that, get help when you realize you need it and before it becomes too late.

There are emergency boxes located throughout campus where you can press a button to alert the MUPD and they're supposed to be on site ASAP. There have been a couple incidences where I think that had there been greater security measures in place, these problems could have been avoided. All exterior doors on dormitories are locked at all times and require students to swipe their student ID to gain entrance, however these doors are not manned, there is simply an electronic swiper. The problem with this is that not EVERY ID is checked to gain access because if there is someone behind a resident swiping in, they can easily just walk right in behind the resident, giving the resident the assumption that they also live in the dorm, which they may not. With there being several hundred people in one building, you don't know every single resident, so you can see where this could pose a problem and it actually has, quite a few times."", ""I'm not actually involved in greek life but it seems like everywhere you look, someone is representing their sorority or fraternity.

There are even traditions that cannot be shared until you actually become a student here, which is kind of cool I think.', ""Mizzou is looked at as a good school from what I understand. It seems pretty over priced for what you get, however. The cost to live here (meaning housing and dining plan) is, in my opinion, extremely over priced for what you actually get. My room is okay but not what you'd expect for what you pay for it and the same goes for the food."", ""There are several clubs and activities to get involved in here on campus, there really is something for everyone. You can volunteer at the women's center, get involved in a music group, fraternity, sorority, recycling club, LGBTQ community, sports, you name it, Mizzou has it."", ""The food and dining gets a neutral rating because although the food they serve is good most of the time, the repetition of the same meals each week gets old quick. The dining halls do tend to get a little dirty during busy times. It seems like every time you sit at a table, it hasn't been wiped down from the people who ate there before you, which bothers me quite a bit. I understand that during rush times it gets a little hectic, but why not have someone on cleaning duty in the dining room?"", ""I gave dorm life here a high rating because overall, it's an okay place to live. Things are always kept really clean and if there's ever a problem, the staff is very quick to address it and get it resolved. The rooms in my particular residence hall are very nice because this building was recently renovated. It is to my understanding that some students here on campus are not living under quite as good of conditions, however. Some buildings still have window unit AC and look pretty drab inside and out."", ""If you are one of those students who gets A's in high school without even cracking a book or breaking a sweat, Mizzou will be a real eye opener for you. If you don't study, you don't pass. It's really that simple. You'd think that was a given in college but you'd be surprised how many people don't realize that little fact until after they've taken, and bombed, their first exam."", ""I would definitely weigh all your options before going to a university of this size. Think about who you are and what you really want before jumping just because this is an attractive school, because there's no doubt that it is beautiful here. Do your research!!!! I cannot stress this enough. If you can find a school that is a better value for you, GO THERE! Mizzou is very pricey for the experience that I've received so far. I'm already considering a transfer and it's still really early in my college career."", 'If you have a hard time adjusting to new places, you might want to rethink coming to this university. The vast amount of people that attend Mizzou make it hard to meet others with your interests and can sometimes make you feel insignificant.

At night however I would not walk around campus alone at the very least as things could probably go wrong. I would also recommend not leaving bikes out at night (signs on campus suggest the same) but overall the safety is rather good.', 'Very prominent part of this university as you usually see them on the way to your next class period doing some sort of pledge or whatnot. Housing for Greek life can vary (as does with every university) but I do not feel like you would miss much if you were not into that sort of thing. This is simply my opinion, in which I am not a part of any sort of Greek life.', 'I personally have not gone to any clubs, but have attended a few activities on campus. I have found that they hold activities and events often, most of them are free and include food or prizes making them very worth while. However if you live off campus and do not have a means of transportation then you might not be able to go to most of these as half of them take place in the late afternoon.', 'The campus can be a very large place with many students, so people who are rather social may enjoy themselves here. The student population does often find ways to have fun as well so if you are looking for a quiet campus this might not be it for you. To fully enjoy yourself here I would think that you would probably have to be both outgoing and very studious.', ""Some unusual traditions include the rubbing of a statue's nose for luck on exams (which actually has lead to it being remodeled several times). Another odd tradition is to not speak under a certain arch due to some local myth on a student that did so and had the dean overhear and expel him. Nothing too extreme but those two are still odd traditions."", 'Its a big university and therefor the cost of most things on campus is pricey, but if you are smart there are plenty of supermarkets that are nearby that you can go to if you want to save money. Its generally a good idea to go that route, but overall the entire campus can cost quite a pretty penny out of your funds. Not too kind on the poor university students wallet.', 'Columbia has quite a lot to do if you have transportation, such as clubs, restaurants, movie theaters, and etc. If you do not have a form of transportation you could always just do things on campus, because there always seems to be something going on. Most of the time however, these events cost money, although if you really look out you may fine free things to do on occasion.', 'Food here is rather pricey but usually always will fill you up. The actual lunchrooms rotate meals so that the same food is not served every day, so there is some sort of variety. The process in getting the foods is usually quick and painless as well.', 'I actually never had a dorm before, but I heard that it is something everyone should experience for themselves. There are many different dorm buildings on campus however so they are all different. It really just depends on your price range and where the building is located I suppose.', 'Like I have stated previously, classes are challenging and you learn a lot. Some classes take some getting used to but usually are forgiving and include some form of extra credit if needed. There are also a lot of resources at every students disposal so there is really no excuse for doing poorly.', 'Come here ready to learn and work hard on studies, otherwise you will probably fail. There are many resources to help you out though so do not be afraid to use them.

Join clubs or do intramural sports, its a great way to relieve stress and to do something you enjoy while networking and meeting new people. Use your resources- YOU ARE PAYING FOR SCHOOL, and basically a lot of salaries around there so don't let anyone a professor, TA or tutor take advantage of that, get help when you realize you need it and before it becomes too late. Some classes you only get 3 grades and after a bad one it is hard to bring it up. Am learning a lot Mizzou so far has been a great experience for me. I am currently about to start my sophomore year and I feel with the help and opportunities I had freshman year that",True,0,0,"{468607=Best in the country, has the largest rush class in the nation in fall 2012., 89881=1. Read this guide before you buy textbooks: http://www.brainofjt.com/2014/01/textbook-trick-save-money.html It could save you thousands of dollars to use the method provided. 2. Many of the courses, especially in the business school, have exams with questions directly from the book rather than lecture. To succeed in those courses you'll need to 3. Get involved with people who actually care about your well-being. As a beginning college student, you'll run into a lot of college students who want you do talk and act like them. Usually that involves compromising your morals. Instead, places such as the BSU or Baptist Student Union will love to have you come in and be a part of everything that goes on there., 615686=Everyone in the dorms are nice and the dorm quality is outstanding. Also going to have lots of dorms remodeled coming 2013., 598196=Mizzou is great for every type of student, really. It is large enough to be able to sneak through in you are more introverted or leave school with 1000 friends (and not just 1000 added Facebook friends)., 632447=Especially if you're in-state, Mizzou is definitely well worth what you pay for your education. If you're out-of-state, Missouri is the easiest state to earn in-state status--just earn $2000 and have a residence in Missouri (e.g. your residence hall or apartment)., 210814=mu has many dinning halls for students. they offer many kinds of food. since 2011, mu open a new place, called student center dining. it offers many choices like pizza, burgers, drinks and sushi. it is so convenient and so nice. in addition, student can buy meal plan for the dining halls, so the average price of each meal is about 8 dollars., 881463=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41613=Downtown Columbia has plenty of great restaurants, bars, etc. True/False Film Festival every year in late February / early March., 713718=I will be attending this school in August and I am very excited. I have done research and heard so much great things about this school. That has helped me make my choice to attend here, this school will help farther me education., 400948=There are a lot of traditions at Mizzou. In August before classes begin the freshman assemble for Tiger Walk where they walk through the Columns toward Jesse Hall. Tiger Walk is symbolic of a student's entrance into the University of Missouri. When students graduate they walk through the columns away from Jesse Hall. This is Tiger Prowl and is symbolic of students becoming Mizzou alumni. There are seven traditions all students are supposed to do before they graduate: climb the dome of Jesse Hall, explore the tunnels, kiss the 50-yard line on Faurot Field, streak across the Quad, ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza, swim in Brady Fountain, and yell I love Mizzou! in Speakers Circle. I forewarn anyone that wants to attempt these that some of them are illegal., 731801=Classes definitely get harder as you go up. Don't think everything will be like your 1000-level days.}",,

The air pump gets hot if left on for long periods. It is not quite hot enough to cause a problem, but it will last longer if it is not always on, and turning it off will keep dust from accumulating inside the laser unnecessarily.

When engraving raster images, they go much faster if you use a lower DPI. The lowest setting is 250 DPI and that is enough for most things. Use higher DPI only with high resolution images and with materials that show the difference.
